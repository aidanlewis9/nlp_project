Introduction
<div class="bookquote">``The InGen Incident''
 (<font color='red'><b>proportions</b></font>)</div>The late twentieth century has witnessed a scientif
ic gold rush of astonishing proportions: the
headlong and furious haste to commercialize genetic
engineering. This enterprise has proceeded
so rapidly-with so little outside commentary-that i
ts dimensions and implications are hardly
understood at all.
Biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in h
uman history. By the end of this decade, it
will have outdistanced atomic power and computers i
n its effect on our everyday lives. In the
words of one observer, <div class="bookquote">``Biotechnology is going to t
ransform every aspect of human life: our
medical care, our food, our health, our entertainme
nt, our very bodies. Nothing will ever be the
same again. It's literally going to change the face
of the planet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>observer</b></font>)</div>But the biotechnology revolution differs in three i
mportant respects from past scientific
transformations.
First, it is broad-based. America entered the atomi
c age through the work of a single research
institution, at Los Alamos. It entered the computer
age through the efforts of about a dozen
companies. But biotecbnology research is now carrie
d out in more than two thousand
laboratories in America alone. Five hundred corpora
tions spend five billion dollars a year on this
technology.
Second, much of the research is thoughtless or friv
olous. Efforts to engineer paler trout for
better visibility in the stream, square trees for e
asier lumbering, and injectable scent cells so you'
ll
always smell of your favorite perfume may seem like
a joke, but they are not. Indeed, the fact that
biotechnology can be applied to the industries trad
itionally subject to the vagaries of fashion,
such as cosmetics and leisure activities, heightens
concern about the whimsical use of this
powerful new technology.
Third, the work is uncontrolled. No one supervises
it. No federal laws regulate it. There is no
coherent government policy, in America or anywhere
else in the world. And because the products
of biotechnology range from drugs to farm crops to
artificial snow, an intelligent policy is difficult
.
But most disturbing is the fact that no watchdogs a
re found among scientists themselves. It is
remarkable that nearly every scientist in genetics
research is also engaged in the commerce of
biotechnology. There are no detached observers. Eve
rybody has a stake.
The commercialization of molecular biology is the m
ost stunning ethical event in the history of
science, and it has happened with astonishing speed
. For four hundred years since Galileo,
science has always proceeded as a free and open inq
uiry into the workings of nature. Scientists
have always ignored national boundaries, holding th
emselves above the transitory concerns of
politics and even wars. Scientists have always rebe
lled against secrecy in research, and have
even frowned on the idea of patenting their discove
ries, seeing themselves as working to the
benefit of all mankind. And for many generations, t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Galileo</b></font>) discoveries of scientists did indeed have a
peculiarly selfless quality.
When, in 1953, two young researchers in England, Ja
mes Watson and Francis Crick,
deciphered the structure of DNA, their work was bai
led as a triumph of the human spirit, of the
centuries-old quest to understand the universe in a
scientific way. It was confidently expected
that their discovery would be selflessly extended t
o the greater benefit of mankind.
Yet that did not happen. Thirty years later, nearly
all of Watson and Crick's scientific
colleagues were engaged in another sort of enterpri
se entirely. Research in molecular genetics
had become a vast, multibillion dollar commercial u
ndertaking, and its origins can be traced not to
1953 but to April 1976.
That was the date of a now famous meeting, in which
Robert Swanson, a venture capitalist,
approached Herbert Boyer, a biochemist at the Unive
rsity of California. The two men agreed to
found a commercial company to exploit Boyer's gene-
splicing techniques. Their new company,
Genentech, quickly became the largest and most succ
essful of the genetic engineering start-ups.
Suddenly it seemed as if everyone wanted to become
rich. New companies were announced
almost weekly, and scientists flocked to exploit ge
netic research. By 1986, at least 362 scientists,
including 64 in the National Academy, sat on the ad
visory boards of biotech firms. The number of
those who held equity positions or consultancies wa
s several times greater.
It is necessary to emphasize how significant this s
hift in attitude actually was. In the past, pure
scientists took a snobbish view of business. They s
aw the pursuit of money as intellectually
uninteresting, suited only to shopkeepers. And to d
o research for industry, even at the prestigious
Bell or IBM labs, was only for those who couldn't g
et a university appointment. Thus the attitude of
pure scientists was fundamentally critical toward t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) work of applied scientists, and to industry
in general. Their long-standing antagonism kept uni
versity scientists free of contaminating
industry ties, and whenever debate arose about tech
nological matters, disinterested scientists
were available to discuss the issues at the highest
levels.
But that is no longer true. There are very few mole
cular biologists and very few research
institutions without commercial affiliations. The o
ld days are gone. Genetic research continues, at a
more furious pace than ever. But it is done in secr
et, and in haste, and for profit.
In this commercial climate, it is probably inevitab
le that a company as ambitious as International
Genetic Technologies, Inc., of Palo Alto, would ari
se. It is equally unsurprising that the genetic
crisis it created should go unreported. After all,
InGen's research was conducted in secret; the
actual incident occurred in the most remote region
of Central America; and fewer than twenty
people were there to witness it. Of those, only a h
andful survived.
Even at the end, when International Genetic Technol
ogies filed for Chapter 11 protection in
San Francisco Superior Court on October 5, 1989, th
e proceedings drew little press attention. It
appeared so ordinary: InGen was the third small Ame
rican bioengineering company to fail that
year, and the seventh since 1986. Few court documen
ts were made public, since the creditors
were Japanese investment consortia, such as Hamagur
i and Densaka, companies which
traditionally shun publicity. To avoid unnecessary
disclosure, Daniel Ross, of Cowan, Swain and
Ross, counsel for InGen, also represented the Japan
ese investors. And the rather unusual
petition of the vice consul of Costa Rica was heard
behind closed doors. Thus it is not surprising
that, within a month, the problems of InGen were qu
ietly and amicably settled.
Parties to that settlement, including the distingui
shed scientific board of advisers, signed a
nondisclosure agreement, and none will speak about
what happened-but many of the principal
figures in the <div class="bookquote">``InGen incident''  (<font color='red'><b>advisers</b></font>)</div>are not signatories
, and were willing to discuss the remarkable
events leading up to those final two days in August
1989 on a remote island off the west coast of
Costa Rica.
JURASSIC PARK
Prologue:
The Bite of the Raptor
The tropical rain fell in drenching sheets, hammeri
ng the corrugated roof of the clinic building,
roaring down the metal gutters, splashing on the gr
ound in a torrent. Roberta Carter sighed, and
stared out the window. From the clinic, she (<font color='blue'><b>Roberta</b></font>) could h
ardly see the beach or the ocean beyond,
cloaked in low fog. This wasn't what she (<font color='blue'><b>Roberta</b></font>) had expect
ed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Roberta</b></font>) had come to the fishing village of
Baha Anasco, on the west coast of Costa Rica, to s
pend two months as a visiting physician.
Bobbie Carter had expected sun and relaxation, afte
r two grueling years of residency in
emergency medicine at Michael Reese in Chicago.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) had been in Baha Anasco now for three weeks. A
nd it had rained every day.
Everything else was fine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) liked the isolation o
f Baha Anasco, and the friendliness of its
people. Costa Rica had one of the twenty best medic
al systems in the world, and even in this
remote coastal village, the clinic was well maintai
ned, amply supplied. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) paramedic, Manuel
Arag6n, was intelligent and well trained. Bobbie wa
s able to practice a level of medicine equal to
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) had practiced in Chicago.
But the rain! The constant, unending rain!
Across the examining room, Manuel cocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Believe me, I hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bobbie/Bobbie Carter/Carter</b></font>)</div>Bobbie said.
<div class="bookquote">``No. Listen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) caught it, another sound blended with
the rain, a deeper rumble that built and
emerged until it was clear: the rhythmic thumping o
f a helicopter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) thought, They can't be
flying in weather like this.
But the sound built steadily, and then the helicopt
er burst low through the ocean fog and
roared overhead, circled, and came back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) saw th
e helicopter swing back over the water,
near the fishing boats, then case sideways to the r
ickety wooden dock, and back toward the
beach.
It was looking for a place to land.
It was a big-bellied Sikorsky with a blue stripe on
the side, with the words <div class="bookquote">``InGen
Construction.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That was the name of the constructio
n company building a new resort on one of
the offshore islands. The resort was said to be spe
ctacular, and very complicated; many of the
local people were employed in the construction, whi
ch had been going on for more than two
years. Bobbie could imagine it-one of those huge Am
erican resorts with swimming pools and
tennis courts, where guests could play and drink th
eir daiquiris without having any contact with
the real life of the country.
Bobbie wondered what was so urgent on that island t
hat the helicopter would fly in this
weather. Through the windshield she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) saw the pilot e
xhale in relief as the helicopter settled onto
the wet sand of the beach. Uniformed men jumped out
, and flung open the big side door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>)
heard frantic shouts in Spanish, and Manuel nudged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>).
They were calling for a doctor.
Two black crewmen carried a limp body toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>), w
hile a white man barked orders. The white
man had a yellow slicker. Red hair appeared around
the edges of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Mets baseball cap. <div class="bookquote">``Is there a
doctor here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) ran up.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm Dr. Carter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) said. The rain fell in heavy
drops, pounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) head and shoulders. The
red-halted man frowned at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) was wearing cut-
off jeans and a tank top. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) had a
stethoscope over her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) shoulder, the bell already rus
ted from the salt air.
<div class="bookquote">``Ed Regis. We've got a very sick man here, doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you better take him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to San Jos,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) said. S
an Jos was the capital, just twenty minutes
away by air.
<div class="bookquote">``We would, but we can't get over the mountains in t
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jos</b></font>) weather. You have to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Jos</b></font>) here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bobbie/Bobbie Carter/Carter</b></font>)</div>Bobbie trotted alongside the injured man as they ca
rried him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the clinic. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a kid, no
older than eighteen. Lifting away the blood-soaked
shirt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) saw a big slashing rip along his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
shoulder, and another on the leg.
<div class="bookquote">``What happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jos</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Construction accident,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed shouted. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jos</b></font>) fell. One
of the backhoes ran over him (<font color='blue'><b>Jos</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>The kid</b></font>)</div>The kid was pale, shivering, unconscious.
Manuel stood by the bright green door of the clinic
, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) arm. The men brought the body
through and set it on the table in the center of th
e room. Manuel started an intravenous line, and
Bobbie swung the light over the kid and bent to exa
mine the wounds. Immediately she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) could see
that it did not look good. The kid would almost cer
tainly die.
A big tearing laceration ran from his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) shoulder down
his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) torso. At the edge of the wound, the
flesh was shredded. At the center, the shoulder was
dislocated, pale bones exposed. A second
slash cut through the heavy muscles of the thigh, d
eep enough to reveal the pulse of the femoral
artery below. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) first impression was that his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) leg
had been ripped open.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell me again about this injury,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``I didn't see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed said. <div class="bookquote">``They say the backhoe d
ragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Jos</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because it almost looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jos</b></font>) was mauled,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bobb</b></font>)</div>Bobb
ie Carter said, probing the wound. Like
most emergency room physicians, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) could remember
in detail patients she (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) had seen even
years before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) had seen two maulings. One was a
two-year-old child who had been attacked
by a Rottweiler dog. The other was a drunken circus
attendant who had had an encounter with a
Bengal tiger. Both injuries were similar. There was
a characteristic look to an animal attack.
<div class="bookquote">``Mauled?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed said. <div class="bookquote">``No, no. It was a backhoe, belie
ve me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed licked his (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) lips as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) spoke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>)
was edgy, acting as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) had done something wrong.
Bobbie wondered why. If they were using
inexperienced local workmen on the resort construct
ion, they must have accidents all the time.
Manuel said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you want lavage?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``After you block him (<font color='blue'><b>Jos</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) bent lower, probed the wound with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) fingertip
s. If an earth mover had rolled over him (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>),
dirt would be forced deep into the wound. But there
wasn't any dirt, just a slippery, slimy foam.
And the wound had a strange odor, a kind of rotten
stench, a smell of death and decay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) had
never smelled anything like it before.
<div class="bookquote">``How long ago did this happen?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``An hour.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) noticed how tense Ed Regis was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) was on
e of those eager, nervous types. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) didn't look like a construction foreman. More li
ke an executive. He (<font color='blue'><b>executive</b></font>) was obviously out of his (<font color='blue'><b>executive</b></font>)
depth.
Bobbie Carter turned back to the injuries. Somehow
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) didn't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) was seeing
mechanical trauma. It just didn't look right. No so
il contamination of the wound site, and no crush-
injury component. Mechanical trauma of any sort-an
auto injury, a factory accident-almost always
had some component of crushing. But here there was
none. Instead, the man's skin was
shredded -ripped-across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder, and again acr
oss his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thigh.
It really did look like a maul. On the other hand,
most of the body was unmarked, which was
unusual for an animal attack. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) looked again at t
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, the arms, the hands -
The hands.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) felt a chill when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) looked at the kid's bands
. There were short slashing cuts on both
palms, and bruises on the wrists and forearms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>)
had worked in Chicago long enough to know
what that meant.
<div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Wait outside.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed said, alarmed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) didn't like that.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you want me to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Jos</b></font>), or not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) said, and
pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) out the door and closed it on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) didn't know what was going on, but sh
e didn't like it. Manuel hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``I continue
to wash?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) reached for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) little Olympus
point-and-shoot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) took several
snapshots of the injury, shifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) light for a b
etter view. It really did look like bites, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) thou
ght.
Then the kid groaned, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) camera aside
and bent toward him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) lips moved, his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>)
tongue thick.
<div class="bookquote">``Raptor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Lo sa raptor ... ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>At those words, Manuel froze, stepped back in horro
r.
<div class="bookquote">``What does it mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>Bobbie said.
Manuel shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I do not know, doctor. `Lo
sa raptor'-no es espaol ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It sounded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) like Spanish. <div class="bookquote">``Then please
continue to wash him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, doctor.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) wrinkled his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) nose. <div class="bookquote">``Bad smell.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>An
d he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) crossed himself.
Bobbie looked again at the slippery foam streaked a
cross the wound. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) touched it, rubbing it
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) fingers. It seemed almost like saliva.
...
The injured boy's lips moved. <div class="bookquote">``Raptor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) whispere
d.
In a tone of horror, Manuel said, <div class="bookquote">``It bit him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What bit him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Raptor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's a raptor?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It

<p/>means hupia.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Bobbie frowned. The Costa Ricans were not especiall
y superstitious, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) had heard the
hupia mentioned in the village before. They were sa
id to be night ghosts, faceless vampires who
kidnapped small children. According to the belief,
the hupia had once lived in the mountains of
Costa Rica, but now inhabited the islands offshore.

<p/>Manuel was backing away, murmuring and crossing him (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>)
self. <div class="bookquote">``It is not normal, this smell,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``It is the hupia.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bobbie/Bobbie Carter/Carter</b></font>)</div>Bobbie was about to order him (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) back to work when the
injured youth opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) eyes and sat
straight up on the table. Manuel shrieked in terror
. The injured boy moaned and twisted his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) head,
looking left and right with wide staring eyes, and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) explosively vomited blood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) went
immediately into convulsions, his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) body vibrating, a
nd Bobbie grabbed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) but he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) shuddered
off the table onto the concrete floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) vomited a
gain. There was blood everywhere. Ed opened
the door, saying, <div class="bookquote">``What the hell's happening?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed</b></font>)</div>and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) saw the blood he (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) turned away, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>)
hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) mouth. Bobbie was grabbing for a stick
to put in the boy's clenched jaws, but even as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) did it she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) knew it was hopeless, and with a fin
al spastic jerk he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) relaxed and lay still.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) bent to perform mouth-to-mouth, but Manuel grab
bed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) shoulder fiercely, pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>)
back. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The hupia will cross over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Manuel, for God's sake-''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) fiercely. <div class="bookquote">``No. You do not un
derstand these things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bobbie/Bobbie Carter/Carter</b></font>)</div>Bobbie looked at the body on the ground and realize
d that it didn't matter; there was no
possibility of resuscitating him (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>). Manuel called for
the men, who came back into the room and took
the body away. Ed appeared, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) mouth with t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) hand, muttering, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you
did all you could,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) watched as the men
took the body away, back to the helicopter,
and it lifted thunderously up into the sky.
<div class="bookquote">``It is better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>Manuel said.
Bobbie was thinking about the boy's hands. They had
been covered with cuts and bruises, in
the characteristic pattern of defense wounds. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) w
as quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) had not died in a
construction accident; he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) had been attacked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>)
had held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) bands against his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) attacker.
<div class="bookquote">``Where is this island they've come from?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) asked
.
<div class="bookquote">``In the ocean. Perhaps a hundred, hundred and twent
y miles offshore,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pretty far for a resort,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) said.
Manuel watched the helicopter. <div class="bookquote">``I hope they never c
ome back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) thought, at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) had pictures. But w
hen she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) turned back to the table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) saw
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) camera was gone.
The rain finally stopped later that night. Alone in
the bedroom behind the clinic, Bobbie thumbed
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) tattered paperback Spanish dictionary.
The boy had said <div class="bookquote">``raptor,''  (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div>and, despite
Manuel's protests, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) suspected it was a Spanish w
ord. Sure enough, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) found it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>)
dictionary. It meant <div class="bookquote">``ravisher''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``abductor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) pause. The sense of the word was susp
iciously close to the meaning of hupia.
Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) did not believe in the superstition.
And no ghost had cut those hands. What had
the boy been trying to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>)?
From the next room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) heard groans. One of the vi
llage women was in the first stage of
labor, and Elena Morales, the local midwife, was at
tending her (<font color='blue'><b>Morales</b></font>). Bobbie went into the clinic room
and gestured to Elena to step outside for a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Elena ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``S, doctor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what is a raptor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Elena/Elena Morales</b></font>)</div>Elena was gray-haired and sixty, a strong woman wit
h a practical, no-nonsense air. In the
night, beneath the stars, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) frowned and said, <div class="bookquote">``Ra
ptor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, You know this word?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">'' S.''  (<font color='red'><b>Elena/Elena Morales</b></font>)</div>Elena nodded. <div class="bookquote">``It means ... a person who c

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A kidnapper?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A hupia?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) whole manner changed. <div class="bookquote">``Do not say this word, do

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do not speak of hupia now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elena/Elena Morales</b></font>)</div>Elena said firmly, nod

laboring woman. ``It is not wise to say this word no

``But does a raptor bite and cut his (<font color='blue'><b>kidnapper</b></font>) victims?''
``Bite and cut?'' Elena said, puzzled. ``No, doctor. N
othing like this. A raptor is a man who takes
a new baby.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) seemed irritated by the conversati
on, impatient to end it. Elena started back
toward the clinic. <div class="bookquote">``I will call to you when she (<font color='blue'><b>baby</b></font>) is
ready, doctor. I think one hour more, perhaps two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bobbie/Bobbie Carter/Carter</b></font>)</div><p/>Bobbie looked at the stars, and listened to the pea
ceful lapping of the surf at the shore. In the
darkness she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) saw the shadows of the fishing boats a
nchored offshore. The whole scene was
quiet, so normal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) felt foolish to be talking of
vampires and kidnapped babies.
Bobbie went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) room, remembering again tha
t Manuel had insisted it was not a
Spanish word. Out of curiosity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) looked in the l
ittle English dictionary, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>) surprise she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobbie</b></font>)
found the word there, too:

<p/>Almost

<p/>Paradise
Mike Bowman whistled cheerfully as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) drove the Lan
d Rover through the Cabo Blanco
Biological Reserve, on the west coast of Costa Rica
. It was a beautiful morning in July, and the
road before him (<font color='blue'><b>Costa</b></font>) was spectacular: hugging the edge o
f a cliff, overlooking the jungle and the blue
Pacific. According to the guidebooks, Cabo Blanco w
as unspoiled wilderness, almost a paradise.
Seeing it now made Bowman feel as if the vacation w
as back on track.
Bowman, a thirty-six-year-old real estate developer
from Dallas, had come to Costa Rica with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Costa</b></font>) wife and daughter for a two-week holiday. The t
rip had actually been his (<font color='blue'><b>Costa</b></font>) wife's idea; for weeks
Ellen had filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Costa</b></font>) ear about the wonderful nation
al parks of Costa Rica, and how good it would
be for Tina to see them. Then, when they arrived, i
t turned out Ellen had an appointment to see a
plastic surgeon in San Jos. That was the first Mik
e Bowman had heard about the excellent and
inexpensive plastic surgery available in Costa Rica
, and all the luxurious private clinics in San
Jos.
Of course they'd had a huge fight, Mike felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>)'d
lied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) had. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) foot
down about this plastic surgery business. Anyway, i
t was ridiculous, Ellen was only thirty, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) was a beautiful woman. Hell, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)'d been Homecom
ing Queen her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) senior year at Rice, and
that was not even ten years earlier. But Ellen tend
ed to be insecure, and worried. And it seemed
as if in recent years she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) had mostly worried about
losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) looks.
That, and everything else.
The Land Rover bounced in a pothole, splashing mud.
Seated beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>), Ellen said, <div class="bookquote">``Mike,
are you sure this is the right road? We haven't see
n any other people for hours.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ellen/Ellen Bowman/Bowman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There was another car fifteen minutes ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) rem
inded her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Remember, the blue one?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Going the other way ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Darling, you wanted a deserted beach,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``a
nd that's what you're going to get.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Ellen shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) head doubtfully. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you're rig
ht.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, Dad, I hope you're right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christina</b></font>)</div>said Christina, f
rom the back seat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) was eight years old.
<div class="bookquote">``Trust me, I'm right.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rice</b></font>) drove in silence a moment
. <div class="bookquote">``It's beautiful, isn't it? Look at that view. It'
s
beautiful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tina/Bowman/Tina Bowman</b></font>)</div>Tina said.
Ellen got out a compact and looked at herself in th
e mirror, pressing under her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)
sighed, and put the compact away.
The road began to descend, and Mike Bowman concentr
ated on driving. Suddenly a small
black shape flashed across the road and Tina shriek
ed, <div class="bookquote">``Look! Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tina/Bowman/Tina Bowman</b></font>)</div>Then it was gone, into the
jungle.
<div class="bookquote">``What was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellen/Ellen Bowman/Bowman</b></font>)</div>Ellen asked. <div class="bookquote">``A monkey7''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ellen/Ellen Bowman/Bowman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe a squirrel monkey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellen/Ellen Bowman/Bowman</b></font>)</div>Bowman said.
<div class="bookquote">``Can I count it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tina/Bowman/Tina Bowman</b></font>)</div>Tina said, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) pencil out,
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) was keeping a list of all the animals she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>)
had seen on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) trip, as a project for school.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike Bowman/Mike</b></font>)</div>Mike said doubtfully.
Tina consulted the pictures in the guidebook. <div class="bookquote">``I do
n't think it was a squirrel monkey,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``I think it was just another howler.''  (<font color='red'><b>howler monkeys</b></font>)</div>They had seen
several howler monkeys already on their trip,
<div class="bookquote">``Hey,''  (<font color='red'><b>howler monkeys</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) said, more brightly. <div class="bookquote">``According to this
book, `the beaches of Cabo Blanco are
frequented by a variety of wildlife, including howl
er and white-faced monkeys, three-toed sloths,
and coatimundis.' You think we'll see a three-toed
sloth, Dad?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I bet we do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just look in the mirror.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very funny, Dad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The road sloped downward through the jungle, toward
the ocean.
Mike Bowman felt like a hero when they finally reac
hed the beach: a two-mile crescent of white
sand, utterly deserted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) parked the Land Rover in
the shade of the palm trees that fringed the
beach, and got out the box lunches. Ellen changed i
nto her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) bathing suit, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Honestly, I don't
know how I'm going to get this weight off.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ellen/Ellen Bowman/Bowman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You look great, hon.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Actually, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) w
as too thin, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) had learned not to mention
that.
Tina was already running down the beach.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't forget you need your sunscreen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellen/Ellen Bowman/Bowman</b></font>)</div>Ellen calle
d.
<div class="bookquote">``Later,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellen/Ellen Bowman/Bowman</b></font>)</div>Tina shouted, over her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) shoulder. ``I'm goin
g to see if there's a sloth.
Ellen Bowman looked around at the beach, and the tr
ees. ``You think she (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>)'s all right?''
``Honey, there's nobody here for miles,'' Mike said.
``What about snakes?''
``Oh, for God's sake,'' Mike Bowman said. ``There's no
snakes on a beach.''
``Well, there might be...''
``Honey,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) said firmly. ``Snakes are cold-blooded.
They're reptiles. They can't control their
body temperature. It's ninety degrees on that sand.
If a snake came out, it'd be cooked. Believe
me. There's no snakes on the beach.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>)
daughter scampering down the beach, a
dark spot on the white sand. ``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) go. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) h
ave a good time.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) arm around his (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) wife's waist.
Tina ran until she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) was exhausted, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) thre
w herself down on the sand and gleefully
rolled to the water's edge. The ocean was warm, and
there was hardly any surf at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) sat for
a while, catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) breath, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) looked b
ack toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) parents and the car, to see
how far she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) had come.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) mother waved, beckoning her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) to return. Tina wav
ed back cheerfully, pretending she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) didn't
understand. Tina didn't want to put sunscreen on. A
nd she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) didn't want to go back and hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>)
mother talk about losing weight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) wanted to stay
right here, and maybe see a sloth.
Tina had seen a sloth two days earlier at the zoo i
n San Jos. It looked like a Muppets
character, and it seemed harmless. In any case, it
couldn't move fast; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) could easily outrun it.
Now her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) mother was calling to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>), and Tina decided
to move out of the sun, back from the
water, to the shade of the palm trees. In this part
of the beach, the palm trees overhung a gnarled
tangle of mangrove roots, which blocked any attempt
to penetrate inland. Tina sat in the sand
and kicked the dried mangrove leaves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) noticed m
any bird tracks in the sand. Costa Rica was
famous for its birds. The guidebooks said there wer
e three times as many birds in Costa Rica as in
all of America and Canada.
In the sand, some of the three-toed bird tracks wer
e small, and so faint they could hardly be
seen. Other tracks were large, and cut deeper in th
e sand. Tina was looking idly at the tracks
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) heard a chirping, followed by a rustling i
n the mangrove thicket.
Did sloths make a chirping sound? Tina didn't think
so, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) wasn't sure. The chirping was
probably some ocean bird. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) waited quietly, not m
oving, hearing the rustling again, and finally
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) saw the source of the sounds, A few yards away,
a lizard emerged from the mangrove roots
and peered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>).
Tina held her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) breath. A new animal for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) list! Th
e lizard stood up on its hind legs, balancing
on its thick tail, and stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>). Standing like
that, it was almost a foot tall, dark green with
brown stripes along its back. Its tiny front legs e
nded in little lizard fingers that wiggled in the a
ir.
The lizard cocked its head as it looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>).
Tina thought it was cute. Sort of like a big salama
nder. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) hand and wiggled her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>)
fingers back.
The lizard wasn't frightened. It came toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>), w
alking upright on its hind legs. It was hardly
bigger than a chicken, and like a chicken it bobbed
its head as it walked. Tina thought it would
make a wonderful pet.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) noticed that the lizard left three-toed tracks
that looked exactly like bird tracks. The lizard
came closer to Tina. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) body still, not w
anting to frighten the little animal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) was
amazed that it would come so close, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) remembe
red that this was a national park. All the
animals in the park would know that they were prote
cted. This lizard was probably tame. Maybe it
even expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) to give it some food. Unfortunate
ly she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) didn't have any. Slowly, Tina extended
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) hand, palm open, to show she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) didn't have any fo
od.
The lizard paused, cocked his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head, and chirped.
``Sorry,'' Tina said. ``I just don't have anything.''
And then, without warning, the lizard jumped up ont
o her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) outstretched hand. Tina could feel its
little toes pinching the skin of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) palm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>)
felt the surprising weight of the animal's body
pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) arm down.
And then the lizard scrambled up her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) arm, toward he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
r face.
``I just wish I could see her (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>),'' Ellen Bowman said, s
quinting in the sunlight. ``That's all. Just see
her (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>).''
``I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>)'s fine,'' Mike said, picking through t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) box lunch packed by the hotel. There was
unappetizing grilled chicken, and some kind of a me
at-filled pastry. Not that Ellen would cat any of
it.
``You don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>)'d leave the beach?'' Ellen said
.
``No, hon, I don't.''
``I feel so isolated here,'' Ellen said.
``I thought that's what you wanted,'' Mike Bowman sai
d.
``I did.''
``Well, then, what's the problem?''
``I just wish I could see her (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>), is all,'' Ellen said.
Then, from down the beach, carried by the wind, the
y heard their daughter's voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) was
screaming.
Puntarenas
``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) is quite comfortable now,'' Dr. Cruz sa
id, lowering the plastic flap of the oxygen tent
around Tina as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) slept. Mike Bowman sat beside th
e bed, close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) daughter. Mike thought
Dr. Cruz was probably pretty capable; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) spoke exce
llent English, the result of training at medical
centers In London and Baltimore. Dr. Cruz radiated
competence, and the Clnica Santa Mara,
the modern hospital in Puntarenas, was spotless and
efficient.
But, even so, Mike Bowman felt nervous. There was n
o getting around the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) only
daughter was desperately ill, and they were far fro
m home.
When Mike had first reached Tina, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) was screaming
hysterically. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) whole left arm was
bloody, covered with a profusion of small bites, ea
ch the size of a thumbprint. And there were
flecks of sticky foam on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) arm, like a foamy sali
va..
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) back down the beach. Almost immediat
ely her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) arm began to redden and swell.
Mike would not soon forget the frantic drive back t
o civilization, the four-wheel-drive Land Rover
slipping and sliding up the muddy track into the hi
lls, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) daughter screamed in fear and
pain, and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) arm grew more bloated and red. Long b
efore they reached the park boundaries, the
swelling had spread to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) neck, and then Tina bega
n to have trouble breathing...
``She (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>)'ll be all right now?'' Ellen said, staring thro
ugh the plastic oxygen tent.
``I believe so,'' Dr. Cruz said. ``I have given her (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) an
other dose of steroids, and her (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) breathing is
much easier. And you can see the edema in her (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) arm i
s greatly reduced.''
Mike Bowman said, ``About those bites...''
``We have no identification yet,<div class="bookquote">'' the doctor said. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I myself haven't seen bites like that before.
But you'll notice they are disappearing. It's alrea
dy quite difficult to make them out. Fortunately I
have taken photographs for reference. And I have wa
shed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) arm to collect some samples of
the sticky saliva-one for analysis here, a second t
o send to the labs in San Jos, and the third we
will keep frozen in case it is needed. Do you have
the picture she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) made?''
``Yes,'' Mike Bowman said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) handed the doctor the s
ketch that Tina had drawn, in response
to questions from the admitting officials.
``This is the animal that bit her (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>)?'' Dr. Cruz said, l
ooking at the picture.
``Yes,'' Mike Bowman said. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) said it was a green l
izard, the size of a chicken or a crow.''
``I don't know of such a lizard,<div class="bookquote">'' the doctor said. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) has drawn it standing on its hind legs...''
``That's right,'' Mike Bowman said. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) said it walk
ed on its hind legs.''
Dr. Cruz frowned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruz</b></font>) stared at the picture a while
longer. ``I am not an expert. I've asked for Dr.
Guitierrez to visit us here. He (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) is a senior researc
her (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) at the Reserva Biolgica de Carara, which is
across the bay. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) can identify the animal
for us.''
``Isn't there someone from Cabo Blanco?'' Bowman aske
d. ``That's where she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanco</b></font>) was bitten.''
``Unfortunately not,'' Dr. Cruz said. ``Cabo Blanco ha
s no permanent staff, and no researcher
has worked there for some time. You were probably t
he (<font color='blue'><b>researcher</b></font>) first people to walk on that beach in
several months. But I am sure you will find Dr. Gui
tierrez to be knowledgeable.''
Dr. Guitierrez turned out to be a bearded man weari
ng khaki shorts and shirt. The surprise was
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruz</b></font>) was American. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruz</b></font>) was introduced to the Bowm
ans, saying in a soft Southern accent, ``Mr.
and Mrs. Bowman, how you doing, nice to meet you,''
and then explaining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruz</b></font>) was a field
biologist from Yale who had worked in Costa Rica fo
r the last five years. Marty Guitierrez
examined Tina thoroughly, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) arm gently, p
eering closely at each of the bites with a
penlight, then measuring them with a small pocket r
uler. After a while, Guitierrez stepped away,
nodding to himself as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guitierrez</b></font>) had understood somethin
g. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guitierrez</b></font>) then inspected the Polaroids, and
asked several questions about the saliva, which Cru
z told him (<font color='blue'><b>Guitierrez</b></font>) was still being tested in the lab.
Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Guitierrez</b></font>) turned to Mike Bowman and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) wife, wait
ing tensely. ``I think Tina's going to be fine.
I just want to be clear about a few details,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) sa
id, making notes in a precise band. ``Your
daughter says she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was bitten by a green lizard, app
roximately one foot high, which walked
upright onto the beach from the mangrove swamp?''
``That's right, yes.''
``And the lizard made some kind of a vocalization?''
``Tina said it chirped, or squeaked.''
``Like a mouse, would you say?''
``Yes.''
``Well, then,'' Dr. Guitierrez said, ``I know this liz
ard.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) explained that, of the six thousand
species of lizards in the world, no more than a doz
en species walked upright. Of those species,
only four were found in Latin America. And judging
by the coloration, the lizard could be only one
of the four. ``I am sure this lizard was a Basiliscu
s amoratus, a striped basilisk lizard, found here
in Costa Rica and also in Honduras. Standing on the
ir hind legs, they are sometimes as tall as a
foot.''
``Are they poisonous?''
``No, Mrs. Bowman. Not at all.'' Guitierrez explained
that the swelling in Tina's arm was an
allergic reaction. ``According to the literature, fo
urteen percent of people are strongly allergic to
reptiles,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) said, ``and your daughter seems to be
one of them.''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was screaming, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said it was so painful.''
``Probably it was,'' Guitierrez said. ``Reptile saliva
contains serotonin, which causes tremendous
pain.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) turned to Cruz. ``Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) blood pressure came
down with antihistamines?''
``Yes,'' Cruz said. ``Promptly.''
``Serotonin,'' Guitierrez said. ``No question.''
Still, Ellen Bowman remained uneasy. ``But why would
a lizard bite her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in the first place?''
``Lizard bites are very common,'' Guitierrez said. ``A
nimal handlers in zoos get bitten all the
time. And just the other day I heard that a lizard
had bitten an infant in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) Crib in Amaloya, about
sixty miles from where you were. So bites do occur.
I'm not sure why your daughter had so many
bites. What was she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) doing at the time?''
``Nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was sitting pretty still, be
cause she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) didn't want to frighten it away.''
``Sitting pretty still,'' Guitierrez said, frowning.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruz</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruz</b></font>) head. ``Well. I don't think we can say
exactly what happened. Wild animals are unpredictab
le.''
``And what about the foamy saliva on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) arm?'' Ellen
said. ``I keep thinking about rabies...''
``No, no,'' Dr. Guitierrez said. ``A reptile can't car
ry rabies, Mrs. Bowman. Your daughter has
suffered an allergic reaction to the bite of a basi
lisk lizard. Nothing more serious.''
Mike Bowman then showed Guitierrez the picture that
Tina had drawn. Guitierrez nodded. ``I
would accept this as a picture of a basillsk lizard
,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) said. ``A few details are wrong, of course.
The neck is much too long, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has drawn the hi
nd legs with only three toes instead of five.
The tall is too thick, and raised too high. But oth
erwise this is a perfectly serviceable lizard of th
e
kind we are talking about.''
``But Tina specifically said the neck was long,'' Ell
en Bowman insisted. ``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) said there
were three toes on the foot.''
``Tina's pretty observant,'' Mike Bowman said.
``I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) is,'' Guitierrez said, smiling. ``But I
still think your daughter was bitten by a
common basilisk amoratus, and had a severe herpetol
ogical reaction. Normal time course with
medication is twelve hours. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) should be just fine
in the morning.''
In the modern laboratory in the basement of the Cl
nica Santa Maria, word was received that Dr.
Guitierrez had identified the animal that had bitte
n the American child as a harmless basilisk
lizard. Immediately the analysis of the saliva was
halted, even though a preliminary fractionation
showed several extremely high molecular weight prot
eins of unknown biological activity. But the
night technician was busy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>technician</b></font>) placed the saliva
samples on the holding shelf of the
refrigerator.
The next morning, the day clerk checked the holding
shelf against the names of discharged
patients. Seeing that BOWMAN, CHRISTINA L. was sche
duled for discharge that morning, the
clerk threw out the saliva samples. At the last mom
ent, he (<font color='blue'><b>L.</b></font>) noticed that one sample had the red
tag which meant that it was to be forwarded to the
university lab in San Jos. He (<font color='blue'><b>L.</b></font>) retrieved the test
tube from the wastebasket, and sent it on its way.
``Go on. Say thank you to Dr. Cruz,'' Ellen Bowman sa
id, and pushed Tina forward.
``Thank you, Dr. Cruz,'' Tina said. ``I feel much bett
er now.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) reached up and shook the
doctor's band. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) said, ``You have a different
shirt.''
For a moment Dr. Cruz looked perplexed; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruz</b></font>) smi
led. ``That's right, Tina. When I work all
night at the hospital, in the morning I change my s
hirt.''
``But not your tie?'' ``No.

<p/>Just my shirt.''
Ellen Bowman said, <div class="bookquote">``Mike told you she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>)'s observant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) certainly is.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Cruz/Cruz</b></font>)</div>Dr. Cruz smiled and shook the l

your holiday in Costa Rica, Tina.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tina/Bowman/Tina Bowman</b></font>)</div>The Bowman family had started to leave when Dr. Cru
z said, <div class="bookquote">``Ob, Tina, do you remember the
lizard that bit you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr.</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Uh-huh.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You remember its feet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Three,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``How do you know that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because I looked,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Anyway, all the bird
s on the beach made marks in the sand with
three toes, like this.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) hand, middl
e three fingers spread wide. <div class="bookquote">``And the lizard
made those kind of marks in the sand, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The lizard made marks like a bird?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Uh-huh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tina/Bowman/Tina Bowman</b></font>)</div>Tina said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) walked like a bird, too. H

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) took a few steps, bobbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) head.
After the Bowmans had departed, Dr. Cruz decided to
report this conversation to Guitierrez, at
the biological station.
<div class="bookquote">``I must admit the girl's story is puzzling,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Guitie
rrez said. <div class="bookquote">``I have been doing some checking
myself. I am no longer certain she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was bitten by a
basilisk. Not certain at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then what could it be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guitierrez/Dr. Guitierrez</b></font>)</div>Guitierrez said, <div class="bookquote">``let's not speculate prema
turely. By the way, have you heard of any
other lizard bites at the hospital?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Guitierrez/Dr. Guitierrez</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let me know, my friend, if you do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marty Guitierrez/Marty</b></font>)</div>The Beach
Marty Guitierrez sat on the beach and watched the a
fternoon sun fall lower in the sky, until it
sparkled harshly on the water of the bay, and its r
ays reached beneath the palm trees, to where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guitierrez</b></font>) sat among the mangroves, on the beach of Cabo Bl
anco. As best he (<font color='blue'><b>Guitierrez</b></font>) could determine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guitierrez</b></font>) was
sitting near the spot where the American girl had b
een, two days before.
Although it was true enough, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guitierrez</b></font>) had told the Bow
mans, that lizard bites were common,
Guitierrez had never heard of a basilisk lizard bit
ing anyone. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Guitierrez</b></font>) had certainly never heard of
anyone being hospitalized for a lizard bite. Then,
too, the bite radius on Tina's arm appeared
slightly too large for a basilisk. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Guitierrez</b></font>) got back
to the Carara station, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guitierrez</b></font>) had checked the small
research library there, but found no reference to b
asilisk lizard bites. Next he (<font color='blue'><b>Guitierrez</b></font>) checked
International BioSciences Services, a computer data
base in America, But he (<font color='blue'><b>Guitierrez</b></font>) found no references
to basilisk bites, or hospitalization for lizard bi
tes.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guitierrez</b></font>) then called the medical officer in Amaloya, who
confirmed that a nine-day-old infant,
sleeping in its crib, had been bitten on the foot b
y an animal the grandmother-the only person
actually to see it-claimed was a lizard. Subsequent
ly the foot had become swollen and the infant
had nearly died. The grandmother described the liza
rd as green with brown stripes. It had bitten
the child several times before the woman frightened
it away.
<div class="bookquote">``Strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guitierrez/Dr. Guitierrez</b></font>)</div>Guitierrez had said.
<div class="bookquote">``No, like all the others,''  (<font color='red'><b>officer</b></font>)</div>the medical officer repl
ied, adding that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had heard of other biting
incidents: A child in V squez, the next village up
the coast, had been bitten while sleeping. And
another in Puerta Sotrero. All these incidents had
occurred in the last two months. All had
involved sleeping children and infants.
Such a new and distinctive pattern led Guitierrez t
o suspect the presence of a previously
unknown species of lizard. This was particularly li
kely to happen in Costa Rica. Only seventy-five
miles wide at its narrowest point, the country was
smaller than the state of Maine. Yet, within its
limited space, Costa Rica had a remarkable diversit
y of biological habitats: seacoasts on both the
Atlantic and the Pacific; four separate mountain ra
nges, including twelve-thousand-foot peaks
and active volcanoes; rain forests, cloud forests,
temperate zones, swampy marshes, and arid
deserts. Such ecological diversity sustained an ast
onishing diversity of plant and animal life.
Costa Rica had three times as many species of birds
as all of North America. More than a
thousand species of orchids. More than five thousan
d species of insects.
New species were being discovered all the time at a
pace that had increased in recent years,
for a sad reason. Costa Rica was becoming deforeste
d, and as jungle species lost their habitats,
they moved to other areas, and sometimes changed be
havior as well.
So a new species was perfectly possible. But along
with the excitement of a new species was
the worrisome possibility of new diseases. Lizards
carried viral diseases, including several that
could be transmitted to man. The most serious was c
entral saurian encephalitis, or CSE, which
caused a form of sleeping sickness in human beings
and horses. Guitierrez felt it was important
to find this new lizard, if only to test it for dis
ease.
Sitting on the beach, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watched the sun drop lower
, and sighed. Perhaps Tina Bowman had
seen a new animal, and perhaps not. Certainly Guiti
errez had not. Earlier that morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
taken the air pistol, loaded the clip with ligamine
darts, and set out for the beach with high hopes.
But the day was wasted. Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have to begin
the drive back up the hill from the beach;
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not want to drive that road in darkness.
Guitierrez got to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet and started back up the
beach. Farther along, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the dark shape
of a howler monkey, ambling along the edge of the m
angrove swamp. Guitierrez moved away,
stepping out toward the water. If there was one how
ler, there would probably be others in the
trees overhead, arid howlers tended to urinate on i
ntruders.
But this particular howler monkey seemed to be alon
e, and walking slowly, and pausing
frequently to sit on its haunches. The monkey had s
omething in its mouth. As Guitierrez came
closer, he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) saw it was eating a lizard. The tail and
the hind legs drooped from the monkey's jaws.
Even from a distance, Guitierrez could see the brow
n stripes against the green.
Guitierrez dropped to the ground and aimed the pist
ol. The howler monkey, accustomed to
living in a protected reserve, stared curiously. He (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>)
did not run away, even when the first dart
whined harmlessly past him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>). When the second dart st
ruck deep in the thigh, the howler shrieked in
anger and surprise, dropping the remains of its mea
l as it fled into the jungle.
Guitierrez got to his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) feet and walked forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) w
asn't worried about the monkey; the
tranquilizer dose was too small to give it anything
but a few minutes of dizziness. Already he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) was
thinking of what to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) new find. Guitierre
z himself would write the preliminary report, but
the remains would have to be sent back to the Unite
d States for final positive identification, of
course. To whom should he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) send it? The acknowledged
expert was Edward H. Simpson,
emeritus professor of zoology at Columbia Universit
y, in New York. An elegant older man with
swept-back white hair, Simpson was the world's lead
ing authority on lizard taxonomy. Probably,
Marty thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marty</b></font>) would send his (<font color='blue'><b>Marty</b></font>) lizard to Dr. Simp
son.
New York
Dr. Richard Stone, head of the Tropical Diseases La
boratory of Columbia University Medical
Center, often remarked that the name conjured up a
grander place than it actually was. In the
early twentieth century, when the laboratory occupi
ed the entire fourth floor of the Biomedical
Research Building, crews of technicians worked to e
liminate the scourges of yellow fever,
malaria, and cholera. But medical successes-and res
earch laboratories in Nairobi and Sao
Paulo-had left the TDL a much less important place
than it once was. Now a fraction of its former
size, it employed only two full-time technicians, a
nd they were primarily concerned with
diagnosing illnesses of New Yorkers who had travele
d abroad. The lab's comfortable routine was
unprepared for what it received that morning.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, very nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>the technician</b></font>)</div>the technician in the Tropical Dis
eases Laboratory said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) read the
customs label. <div class="bookquote">``Partially masticated fragment of un
identified Costa Rican lizard.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wrinkled
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) nose. <div class="bookquote">``This one's all yours, Dr. Stone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Richard Stone/Richard</b></font>)</div>Richard Stone crossed the lab to inspect the new ar
rival. <div class="bookquote">``Is this the material from Ed
Simpson's lab?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said. ``But I don't know why they'd send
a lizard to us.
``His (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) secretary called,'' Stone said. ``Simpson's on a
field trip in Borneo for the summer, and
because there's a question of communicable disease
with this lizard, she (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) asked our lab to take a
took at it. Let's see what we've got.''
The white plastic cylinder was the size of a half-g
allon milk container, it had locking metal
latches and a screw top. It was labeled ``Internatio
nal Biological Specimen Container'' and
plastered with stickers and warnings in four langua
ges. The warnings were intended to keep the
cylinder from being opened by suspicious customs of
ficials.
Apparently the warnings had worked; as Richard Ston
e swung the big light over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) could see
the seals were still intact. Stone turned on the ai
r handlers and pulled on plastic gloves and a
face mask. After all, the lab had recently identifi
ed specimens contaminated with Venezuelan
equine fever, Japanese B encephalitis, Kyasanur For
est virus, Langat virus, and Mayaro. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) unscrewed the top.
There was the hiss of escaping gas, and white smoke
boiled out. The cylinder turned frosty
cold. Inside he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) found a plastic zip-lock sandwich b
ag, containing something green. Stone spread a
surgical drape on the table and shook out the conte
nts of the bag. A piece of frozen flesh struck
the table with a dull thud.
``Huh,'' the technician said. ``Looks eaten.''
``Yes, it does,'' Stone said. ``What do they want with
us?''
The technician consulted the enclosed documents. ``L
izard is biting local children. They have a
question about identification of the species, and a
concern about diseases transmitted from the
bite.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) produced a child's picture of a lizard,
signed TINA at the top. ``One of the kids drew a
picture of the lizard.''
Stone glanced at the picture. ``Obviously we can't v
erify the species,'' Stone said. ``But we can
check diseases easily enough, if we can get any blo
od out of this fragment. What are they calling
this animal?<div class="bookquote">''
''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`Basiliscus amoratus with three-toed genetic anom
aly,' '' she (<font color='blue'><b>TINA</b></font>) said, reading.
``Okay,'' Stone said. ``Let's get started. While you'r
e waiting for it to thaw, do an X-ray and take
Polaroids for the record. Once we have blood, start
running antibody sets until we get some
matches. Let me know if there's a problem.''
Before lunchtime, the lab had its answer: the lizar
d blood showed no significant reactivity to any
viral or bacterial antigen. They had run toxicity p
rofiles as well, and they had found only one
positive match: the blood was mildly reactive to th
e venom of the Indian king cobra. But such
cross-reactivity was common among reptile species,
and Dr. Stone did not think it noteworthy to
include in the fax his (<font color='blue'><b>Stone</b></font>) technician sent to Dr. Marti
n Guitierrez that same evening.
There was never any question about identifying the
lizard; that would await the return of Dr.
Simpson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) was not due back for several weeks, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) secretary asked if the TDL would
please store the lizard fragment in the meantime. D
r. Stone put it back in the zip-lock bag and
stuck it in the freezer.
Martin Guitierrez read the fax from the Columbia Me
dical Center/Tropical Diseases Laboratory. It
was brief: -
SUBJECT:
Basiliscus amoratus with genetic anomaly
-LRB-forwarded from Dr. Simpson's office-RRB-
MATERIALS:
posterior segment, ? partially eaten animal
PROCEDURES PERFORMED. X-ray, Microscopic, immunolog
ical RTX for
viral, parasitic, bacterial disease.
FINDINGS: No histologic or immunologic evidence for
any communicable disease in man in this
Basiliscus amoratus sample.
-LRB-signed-RRB-
Richard A. Stone, M.D., director
Guitierrez made two assumptions based on the memo.
First, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) identification of the lizard
as a basilisk had been confirmed by scientists at C
olumbia University. And second, that the
absence of communicable disease meant the recent ep
isodes of sporadic lizard bites implied no
serious health hazards for Costa Rica. On the contr
ary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Costa</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Costa</b></font>) original views were correct:
that a lizard species had been driven from the fore
st into a new habitat, and was coming into
contact with village people. Guitierrez was certain
that in a few more weeks the lizards would
settle down and the biting episodes won end.
The tropical rain fell in great drenching sheets, h
ammering the corrugated roof of the clinic in
Baha Anasco. It was nearly midnight; power had bee
n lost in the storm, and the midwife Elena
Morales was working by flashlight when she (<font color='blue'><b>Morales</b></font>) heard a
squeaking, chirping sound. Thinking that it
was a rat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morales</b></font>) quickly put a compress on the forehe
ad of the mother and went into the next room
to check on the newborn baby. As her (<font color='blue'><b>Morales</b></font>) hand touched t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Morales</b></font>) doorknob, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morales</b></font>) heard the chirping again,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morales</b></font>) relaxed. Evidently it was just a bird, flyi
ng in the window to get out of the rain. Costa
Ricans said that when a bird came to visit a newbor
n child, it brought good luck.
Elena opened the door. The infant lay in a wicker b
assinet, swaddled in a light blanket, only its
face exposed. Around the rim of the bassinet, three
dark-green lizards crouched like gargoyles.
When they saw Elena, they cocked their heads and st
ared curiously at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>), but did not flee. In the
light of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) flashlight Elena saw the blood drippin
g from their snouts. Softly chirping, one lizard
bent down and, with a quick shake of its head, tore
a ragged chunk of flesh from the baby.
Elena rushed forward, screaming, and the lizards fl
ed into the darkness. But long before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>)
reached the bassinet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) could see what had happen
ed to the infant's face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) knew the
child must be dead. The lizards scattered into the
rainy night, chirping and squealing, leaving
behind only bloody three-toed tracks, like birds.
The Shape of the Data
Later, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elena</b></font>) was calmer, Elena Morales decided n
ot to report the lizard attack. Despite the
horror she (<font color='blue'><b>Morales</b></font>) had seen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morales</b></font>) began to worry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Morales</b></font>) mi
ght be criticized for leaving the baby
unguarded. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Morales</b></font>) told the mother that the baby had
asphyxiated, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morales</b></font>) reported the death on
the forms she (<font color='blue'><b>Morales</b></font>) sent to San Jos as SIDS: sudden infa
nt death syndrome. This was a syndrome of
unexplained death among very young children; it was
unremarkable, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morales</b></font>) report went
unchallenged.
The university lab in San Jos that analyzed the sa
liva sample from Tina Bowman's arm made
several remarkable discoveries. There was, as expec
ted, a great deal of serotonin. But among
the salivary proteins was a real monster:molecular
mass of 1,980, one of the largest proteins
known. Biological activity was still under study, b
ut it seemed to be a neurotoxic poison related to
cobra venom, although more primitive in structure.
The lab also detected trace quantities of the gamma
-amino metbionine hydrolase. Because
this enzyme was a marker for genetic engineering, a
nd not found in wild animals, technicians
assumed it was a lab contaminant and did not report
it when they called Dr, Cruz, the referring
physician in Puntarenas.
The lizard fragment rested in the freezer at Columb
ia University, awaiting the return of Dr.
Simpson, who was not expected for at least a month.
And so things might have remained, had
not a technician named Alice Levin walked into the
Tropical Diseases Laboratory, seen Tina
Bowman's picture, and said, ``Oh, whose kid drew the
dinosaur?''
``What?'' Richard Stone said, turning slowly toward h
er.
``The dinosaur. Isn't that what it is? My kid draws
them all the time.''
``This is a lizard,'' Stone said. ``From Costa Rica. S
ome girl down there drew a picture of it.''
``No,'' Alice Levin said, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Levin</b></font>) head. ``Look at
it. It's very clear. Big head, long neck, stands
on its hind legs, thick tail. It's a dinosaur.''
``It can't be. It was only a foot tall.''
``So? There were little dinosaurs back then,'' Alice
said. ``Believe me, I know. I have two boys,
I'm an expert. The smallest dinosaurs were under a
foot. Teenysaurus or something, I don't
know. Those names are impossible. You'll never lear
n those names if you're over the age of ten.''
``You don't understand,'' Richard Stone said. <div class="bookquote">``This i
s a picture of a contemporary animal. They
sent us a fragment of the animal. It's in the freez

Alice Levin looked at the frozen piece of leg and t

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Stone continued to shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Stone</b></font>) head. Alice was uninfo

worked in the bacteriology lab down the hall. And s

The Shore of the Inland Sea
Alan Grant crouched down, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) nose inches from the
ground. The temperature was over a
hundred degrees. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) knees ached, despite the rug-l
ayer's pads he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) wore. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) lungs burned from
the harsh alkaline dust. Sweat dripped off his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) fore
head onto the ground. But Grant was oblivious to
the discomfort. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) entire attention was focused on
the six-inch square of earth in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>).
Working patiently with a dental pick and an artist'
s camel brush, he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) exposed the tiny L-shaped
fragment of jawbone. It was only an inch long, and
no thicker than his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) little finger. The teeth were
a row of small points, and had the characteristic m
edia-RSB- angling. Bits of bone flaked away as he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>)
dug. Grant paused for a moment to paint the bone wi
th rubber cement before continuing to
expose it. There was no question that this was the
jawbone from an infant carnivorous dinosaur.
Its owner had died seventy-nine million years ago,
at the age of about two months. With any luck,
Grant might find the rest of the skeleton as well.
If so, it would be the first complete skeleton of a

<p/>baby carnivore -
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, Alan!''
 (<font color='red'><b>baby</b></font>)</div>Alan Grant looked up, blinking in the sunlight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
pulled down his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sunglasses, and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
forehead with the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) arm.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was crouched on an eroded hillside in the badlan
ds outside Snakewater, Montana.
Beneath the great blue bowl of sky, blunted hills,
exposed outcroppings of crumbling limestone,
stretched for miles in every direction. There was n
ot a tree, or a bush. Nothing but barren rock,
hot sun, and whining wind.
Visitors found the badlands depressingly bleak, but
when Grant looked at this landscape, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
saw something else entirely. This barren land was w
hat remained of another, very different world,
which had vanished eighty million years ago. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
mind's eye, Grant saw himself back in the
warm, swampy bayou that formed the shoreline of a g
reat inland sea. This inland sea was a
thousand miles wide, extending all the way from the
newly upthrust Rocky Mountains to the
sharp, craggy peaks of the Appalachians. All of the
American West was underwater.
At that time, there were thin clouds in the sky ove
rhead, darkened by the smoke of nearby
volcanoes. The atmosphere was denser, richer in car
bon dioxide. Plants grew rapidly along the
shoreline. There were no fish in these waters, but
there were clams and snails. Pterosaurs
swooped down to scoop algae from the surface. A few
carnivorous dinosaurs prowled the
swampy shores of the lake, moving among the palm tr
ees. And offshore was a small island,
about two acres in size. Ringed with dense vegetati
on, this island formed a protected sanctuary
where herds of herbivorous duckbilled dinosaurs lai
d their eggs in communal nests, and raised
their squeaking young.
Over the millions of years that followed, the pale
green alkaline lake grew shallower, and finally
vanished. The exposed land buckled and cracked unde
r the heat. And the offshore island with its
dinosaur eggs became the eroded hillside in norther
n Montana which Alan Grant was now
excavating.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, Alan!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) stood, a barrel-chested, bearded man of forty. H
e heard the chugging of the portable
generator, and the distant clatter of the jackhamme
r cutting into the dense rock on the next hill.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw the kids working around the jackhammer, movi
ng away the big pieces of rock after
checking them for fossils. At the foot of the hill,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw the six tipis of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) camp, the flapping mes
s
tent, and the trailer that served as their field la
boratory. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw Ellie waving to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), from the
shadow of the field laboratory.
<div class="bookquote">``Visitor!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) called, and pointed to the east.
Grant saw the cloud of dust, and the blue Ford seda
n bouncing over the rutted road toward
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) watch: right on time. On th
e other hill, the kids looked up with interest.
They didn't get many visitors in Snakewater, and th
ere had been a lot of speculation about what a
lawyer from the Environmental Protection Agency wou
ld want to see Alan Grant about.
But Grant knew that paleontology, the study of exti
nct life, had in recent years taken on an
unexpected relevance to the modern world. The modem
world was changing fast, and urgent
questions about the weather, deforestation, global
warming, or the ozone layer often seemed
answerable, at least in part, with information from
the past. Information that paleontologists could
provide. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had been called as an expert witness tw
ice in the past few years.
Grant started down the hill to meet the car.
The visitor coughed in the white dust as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) slammed
the car door. <div class="bookquote">``Bob Morris, EPA,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said,
extending his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``I'm with the San Francisco off
ice. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant introduced himself and said, <div class="bookquote">``You look hot. W
ant a beer?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jesus, yeah.''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris</b></font>)</div>Morris was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) late twenties, wea
ring a tie, and pants from a business suit.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) carried a briefcase. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) wing-tip shoes crunched
on the rocks as they walked toward the
trailer.
<div class="bookquote">``When I first came over the hill, I thought this wa
s an Indian reservation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris</b></font>)</div>Morris said, pointing
to the tipis.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``Just the best way to live out he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)
re.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant explained that in 1978, the first
year of the excavations, they had come out in North
Slope octahedral tents, the most advanced
available. But the tents always blew over in the wi
nd. They tried other kinds of tents, with the
same result. Finally they started putting up tipis,
which were larger inside, more comfortable, and
more stable in wind. <div class="bookquote">``These're Blackfoot tipis, bui
lt around four poles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. ``Sioux tipis are

<p/>built around three. But this used to be Blackfoot t
erritory, so we thought ...''
``Uh-huh,'' Morris said. ``Very fitting.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) squinted
at the desolate landscape and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
head. ``How long you been out here?''
``About sixty cases,'' Grant said. When Morris looked
surprised, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) explained, ``We measure
time in beer. We start in June with a hundred cases
. We've gone through about sixty so far.''
``Sixty-three, to be exact,'' Ellie Sattler said, as
they reached the trailer. Grant was amused to
see Morris gaping at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>). Ellie was wearing cut-off
jeans and a workshirt tied at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) midriff. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
was twenty-four and darkly tanned. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) blond hair w
as pulled back.
``Ellie keeps us going,'' Grant said, introducing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)'s very good at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) does.''
``What does she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) do?'' Morris asked.
``Paleobotany,'' Ellie said. ``And I also do the stand
ard field preps.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) opened the door and
they went inside.
The air conditioning in the trailer only brought th
e temperature down to eighty-five degrees, but
it seemed cool after the midday beat. The trailer h
ad a series of long wooden tables, with tiny
bone specimens neatly laid out, tagged and labeled.
Farther along were ceramic dishes and
crocks. There was a strong odor of vinegar.
Morris glanced at the bones. ``I thought dinosaurs w
ere big,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said.
``They were,'' Ellie said. ``But everything you see he (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
re comes from babies. Snakewater is
important primarily because of the number of dinosa
ur nesting sites here. Until we started this
work, there were hardly any infant dinosaurs known.
Only one nest had ever been found, in the
Gobi Desert. We've discovered a dozen different had
rosaur nests, complete with eggs and bones
of infants.''
While Grant went to the refrigerator, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) showed Mo
rris the acetic acid baths, which were used
to dissolve away the limestone from the delicate bo
nes.
``They look like chicken bones,'' Morris said, peerin
g into the ceramic dishes.
``Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said. ``They're very bird-like.''
``And what about those?'' Morris said, pointing throu
gh the trailer window to piles of large bones
outside, wrapped in heavy plastic.
``Rejects,'' Ellie said. ``Bones too fragmentary when
we took them out of the ground, In the old
days we'd just discard them, but nowadays we send t
hem for genetic testing.''
``Genetic testing?'' Morris said.
``Here you go,'' Grant said, thrusting a beer into hi
s band. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) gave another to Ellie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
chugged hers, throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) long neck back. Morris s
tared.
``We're pretty informal here,'' Grant said. ``Want to
step into my office?''
``Sure,'' Morris said. Grant led him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) to the end of th
e trailer, where there was a torn couch, a
sagging chair, and a battered endtable. Grant dropp
ed onto the couch, which creaked and
exhaled a cloud of chalky dust. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) leaned back, thu
mped his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) boots up on the endtable, and
gestured for Morris to sit in the chair. ``Make your
self comfortable.''
Grant was a professor of paleontology at the Univer
sity of Denver, and one of the foremost
researchers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) field, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had never been com
fortable with social niceties. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw himself
as an outdoor man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) knew that all the importa
nt work in paleontology was done outdoors,
with your bands. Grant had little patience for the
academics, for the museum curators, for what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) called Teacup Dinosaur Hunters. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) took some
pains to distance himself in dress and
behavior from the Teacup Dinosaur Hunters, even del
ivering his (<font color='blue'><b>Dinosaur</b></font>) lectures in jeans and sneakers.
Grant watched as Morris primly brushed off the seat
of the chair before he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) sat down. Morris
opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) briefcase, rummaged through his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) papers,
and glanced back at Ellie, who was lifting
bones with tweezers from the acid bath at the other
end of the trailer, paying no attention to them.
``You're probably wondering why I'm here.''
Grant nodded. ``It's a long way to come, Mr. Morris.
''
``Well,'' Morris said, ``to get right to the point, th
e EPA is concerned about the activities of the
Hammond Foundation. You receive some funding from t
hem.''
``Thirty thousand dollars a year,'' Grant said, noddi
ng. ``For the last five years.''
``What do you know about the foundation?'' Morris sai
d.
Grant shrugged. ``The Hammond Foundation is a respec
ted source of academic grants. They
fund research all over the world, including several
dinosaur researchers. I know they support Bob
Kerry out of the Tyrrell in Alberta, and John Welle
r in Alaska. Probably more.''
``Do you know why the Hammond Foundation supports so
much dinosaur research?'' Morris
asked.
``Of course. It's because old John Hammond is a dino
saur nut.''
``You've met Hammond?''
Grant shrugged. ``Once or twice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) comes here for b
rief visits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)'s quite elderly, you know.
And eccentric, the way rich people sometimes are. B
ut always very enthusiastic. Why?''
``Well,'' Morris said, ``the Hammond Foundation is act
ually a rather mysterious organization.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
pulled out a Xeroxed world map, marked with red dot
s, and passed it to Grant. ``These are the
digs the foundation financed last year. Notice anyt
hing odd about them? Montana, Alaska,
Canada, Sweden ... They're all sites in the north
. There's nothing below the forty-fifth parallel.''
Morris pulled out more maps. ``It's the same, year a
fter year. Dinosaur projects to the south, in
Utah or Colorado or Mexico, never get funded. The H
ammond Foundation only supports cold-
weather digs. We'd like to know why.''
Grant shuffled through the maps quickly. If it was
true that the foundation only supported cold-
weather digs, then it was strange behavior, because
some of the best dinosaur researchers were
working in hot climates, and -
``And there are other puzzles,'' Morris said. ``For ex
ample, what is the relationship of dinosaurs
to amber?''
``Amber?''
``Yes. It's the hard yellow resin of dried tree sap-
''
``I know what it is,'' Grant said. ``But why are you a
sking?''
``Because,'' Morris said, ``over the last five years,
Hammond has purchased enormous
quantities of amber in America, Europe, and Asia, i
ncluding many pieces of museum-quality
jewelry. The foundation has spent seventeen million
dollars on amber. They now possess the
largest privately held stock of this material in th
e world.''
``I don't get it,'' Grant said.
``Neither does anybody else,'' Morris said. ``As far a
s we can tell, it doesn't make any sense at
all. Amber is easily synthesized. It has no commerc
ial or defense value. There's no reason to
stockpile it. But Hammond has done just that, over
many years.''
``Amber,'' Grant said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) head.
``And what about his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) island in Costa Rica?'' Morris c
ontinued. ``Ten years ago, the Hammond
Foundation leased an island from the government of
Costa Rica. Supposedly to set up a
biological preserve.''
``I don't know anything about that,'' Grant said, fro
wning.
``I haven't been able to find out much,'' Morris said
. ``The island is a hundred miles off the west
coast. It's very rugged, and it's in an area of oce
an where the combinations of wind and current
make it almost perpetually covered in fog. They use
d to call it Cloud Island. Isla Nublar.
Apparently the Costa Ricans were amazed that anybod
y would want it.'' Morris searched in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
briefcase. ``The reason I mention it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said, ``is
that, according to the records, you were paid a
consultant's fee in connection with this island.''
``I was?'' Grant said.
Morris passed a sheet of paper to Grant. It was the
Xerox of a check issued in March 1984
from InGen Inc., Farallon Road, Palo Alto, Californ
ia. Made out to Alan Grant In the amount of
twelve thousand dollars. At the lower corner, the c
heck was marked CONSULTANT
SERVICES/COSTA RICA/JUVENILE HYPERSPACE.
``Ob, sure,'' Grant said. ``I remember that. It was we
ird as hell, but I remember it. And it didn't
have anything to do with an island.''
Alan Grant had found the first clutch of dinosaur e
ggs in Montana in 1979, and many more in the
next two years, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) hadn't gotten around to publ
ishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) findings until 1983. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) paper, with
its report of a herd of ten thousand duckbilled din
osaurs living along the shore of a vast inland
sea, building communal nests of eggs in the mud, ra
ising their infant dinosaurs in the herd, made
Grant a celebrity overnight. The notion of maternal
instincts in giant dinosaurs-and the drawings
of cute babies poking their snouts out of the eggs-
had appeal around the world. Grant was
besieged with requests for interviews, lectures, bo
oks. Characteristically, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) turned them all
down, wanting only to continue his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) excavations. But
it was during those frantic days of the mid-
1980s that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was approached by the InGen corporati
on with a request for consulting services.
``Had you heard of InGen before?'' Morris asked. ``No.
''
``How did they contact you?''
``Telephone call. It was a man named Gennaro or Genn
ino, something like that.''
Morris nodded. ``Donald Gennaro,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)'s the
legal counsel for InGen.''
``Anyway, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) wanted to know about eating habits of d
inosaurs. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) offered me a fee to
draw up a paper for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>).'' Grant drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) beer, set
the can on the floor. ``Gennaro was
particularly interested in young dinosaurs. Infants
and juveniles. What they ate. I guess he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
thought I would know about that.''
``Did you?''
``Not really, no. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) that. We had found lots
of skeletal material, but we had very little
dietary data. But Gennaro said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) knew we hadn't pu
blished everything, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) wanted whatever
we had. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) offered a very large fee. Fifty thou
sand dollars.''
Morris took out a tape recorder and set it on the e
ndtable. ``You mind?''
``No, go ahead.''
``So Gennaro telephoned you in 1984. What happened t
hen?''
``Well,'' Grant said. ``You see our operation here. Fi
fty thousand would support two full summers
of digging. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) I'd do what I could.''
``So you agreed to prepare a paper for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>).''
``Yes.''
``On the dietary habits of juvenile dinosaurs?''
``Yes.''
``You met Gennaro?''
``No. Just on the phone.''
``Did Gennaro say why he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) wanted this information?''
``Yes,'' Grant said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) was planning a museum for ch
ildren, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) wanted to feature baby
dinosaurs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) was hiring a number of academ
ic consultants, and named them. There
were paleontologists like me, and a mathematician f
rom Texas named Ian Malcolm, and a couple
of ecologists. A systems analyst. Good group.''
Morris nodded, making notes. ``So you accepted the c
onsultancy?''
``Yes. I agreed to send him (<font color='blue'><b>analyst</b></font>) a summary of our work: w
hat we knew about the habits of the
duckbilled hadrosaurs we'd found.''
``What kind of information did you send?'' Morris ask
ed.
``Everything: nesting behavior, territorial ranges,
feeding behavior, social behavior. Everything.''
``And how did Gennaro respond?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) kept calling and calling. Sometimes in the midd
le of the night. Would the dinosaurs eat
this? Would they eat that? Should the exhibit inclu
de this? I could never understand why he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) was
so worked up. I mean, I think dinosaurs are importa
nt, too, but not that important. They've been
dead sixty-five million years. You'd think his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) call
s could wait until morning.''
``I see,'' Morris said. ``And the fifty thousand dolla
rs?''
Grant shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head. ``I got tired of Gennaro and c
alled the whole thing off. We settled up for
twelve thousand. That must have been about the midd
le of '85.''
Morris made a note. ``And InGen? Any other contact w
ith them?''
``Not since 1985.''
``And when did the Hammond Foundation begin to fund
your research?''
``I'd have to look,'' Grant said. ``But it was around
then. Mid-eighties.''
``And you know Hammond as just a rich dinosaur enthu
siast.''
``Yes.''
Morris made another note.
``Look,'' Grant said. ``If the EPA is so concerned abo
ut John Hammond and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)'s doing-the
dinosaur sites in the north, the amber purchases, t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) island in Costa Rica-why don't you `ust ask
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) about it?''
``At the moment, we can't,'' Morris said. ``Why not?''
Grant said.
``Because we don't have any evidence of wrongdoing,''
Morris said. ``But personally, I think it's
clear John Hammond is evading the law.''
``I was first contacted,'' Morris explained, ``by the
Office of Technology Transfer. The OTT
monitors shipments of American technology which mig
ht have military significance. They called
to say that InGen had two areas of possible illegal
technology transfer. First, InGen shipped three
Cray XMPs to Costa Rica. InGen characterized it as
transfer within corporate divisions, and said
they weren't for resale. But OTT couldn't imagine w
hy the hell somebody'd need that power in
Costa Rica.''
``Three Crays,'' Grant said. ``is that a kind of compu
ter?''
Morris nodded. ``Very powerful supercomputers. To pu
t it in perspective, three Crays represent
more computing power than any other privately held
company in America. And InGen sent the
machines to Costa Rica. You have to wonder why.''
``I give up. Why?'' Grant said.
``Nobody knows. And the Hoods are even more worrisom
e,'' Morris continued. ``Hoods are
automated gene sequencers-machines that work out th
e genetic code by themselves. They're so
new that they haven't been put on the restricted li
sts yet. But any genetic engineering lab is likely
to
have one, if it can afford the half-million-dollar
price tag.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) flipped through his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) notes. ``Well, it

<p/>seems InGen shipped twenty-four Hood sequencers to
their island in Costa Rica.
<div class="bookquote">``Again, they said it was a transfer within division
s and not an export,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris</b></font>)</div>Morris said. <div class="bookquote">``There
wasn't much that OTT could do. They're not official
ly concerned with use. But InGen was
obviously setting up one of the most powerful genet
ic engineering facilities in the world in an
obscure Central American country. A country with no
regulations. That kind of thing has
happened before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>bioenginec ring companies</b></font>)</div>There had already been cases of American bioenginec
ring companies moving to another
country so they would not be hampered by regulation
s and rules. The most flagrant, Morris
explained, was the Biosyn rabies case.
In 1986, Genetic Biosyn Corporation of Cupertino te
sted a bioengineered rabies vaccine on a
farm in Chile. They didn't inform the government of
Chile, or the farm workers involved. They
simply released the vaccine.
The vaccine consisted of live rabies virus, genetic
ally modified to be nonvirulent. But the
virulence hadn't been tested; Biosyn didn't know wh
ether the virus could still cause rabies or not.
Even worse, the virus had been modified. Ordinarily
you couldn't contract rabies unless you were
bitten by an animal. But Biosyn modified the rabies
virus to cross the pulmonary alveoli; you
could get an infection just inhaling it. Biosyn sta
ffers brought this live rabies virus down to Chile
in
a carry-on bag on a commercial airline flight. Morr
is often wondered what would have happened
if the capsule had broken open during the flight. E
verybody on the plane might have been
infected with rabies.
It was outrageous. It was irresponsible. It was cri
minally negligent. But no action was taken
against Biosyn. The Chilean farmers who unwittingly
risked their lives were ignorant peasants;
the government of Chile had an economic crisis to w
orry about; and the American authorities had
no jurisdiction. So Lewis Dodgson, the geneticist r
esponsible for the test, was still working at
Biosyn. Biosyn was still as reckless as ever. And o
ther American companies were hurrying to set
up facilities in foreign countries that lacked soph
istication about genetic research. Countries that
perceived genetic engineering to be like any other
high-tech development, and thus welcomed it to
their lands, unaware of the dangers posed.

Ellie Sattler brushed a strand of blond hair back f

baths. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) had six in a row, at molar strengths fro

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Definitely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe our luck has final
ly turned.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>For the last two years at Snakewater, the team had
excavated only duckbilled hadrosaurs.
They already had evidence for vast herds of these g
razing dinosaurs, roaming the Cretaceous
plains in groups of ten or twenty thousand, as buff
alo would later roam.
But increasingly the question that faced them was:
where were the predators?
They expected predators to be rare, of course. Stud
ies of predator/prey populations in the
game parks of Africa and India suggested that, roug
hly speaking, there was one predatory
carnivore for every four hundred herbivores. That m
eant a herd of ten thousand duckbills would
support only twenty-five tyrannosaurs. So it was un
likely that they would find the remains of a
large predator.
But where were the smaller predators? Snakewater ha
d dozens of nesting sites-in some
places, the ground was literally covered with fragm
ents of dinosaur eggshells-and many small
dinosaurs ate eggs. Animals like Dromaeosaurus, Ovi
raptor, Velociraptor, and Coelurus-
predators three to six feet tall-must have been fou
nd here in abundance.
But they had discovered none so far.
Perhaps this velociraptor skeleton did mean their l
uck had changed. And an infant! Ellie knew
that one of Grant's dreams was to study infant-rear
ing behavior in carnivorous dinosaurs, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
had already studied the behavior of herbivores. Per
haps this was the first step toward that dream.
<div class="bookquote">``You must be pretty excited,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said.
Grant didn't answer.
<div class="bookquote">``I said, you must be excited,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie repeated.
<div class="bookquote">``My God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was staring at the fax.
Ellie looked over Grant's shoulder at the X-ray, an
d breathed out slowly. <div class="bookquote">``You think it's an
amassicus?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``Or a triassicus. The skeleton i
s so light.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But
it's no lizard,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``This is not a lizard. No three-t
oed lizard has walked on this planet for two
hundred million years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie's first thought was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was looking at a
hoax-an ingenious, skillful hoax, but a hoax
nonetheless. Every biologist knew that the threat o
f a hoax was omnipresent. The most famous
hoax, the Piltdown man, had gone undetected for for
ty years, and its perpetrator was still
unknown. More recently, the distinguished astronome
r Fred Hoyle had claimed that a fossil
winged dinosaur, Archaeopteryx, on display in the B
ritish Museum, was a fraud. -LRB-It was later
shown to be genuine.-RRB-
The essence of a successful hoax was that it presen
ted scientists with what they expected to
see. And, to Ellie's eye, the X-ray image of the li
zard was exactly correct. The three-toed foot was
well balanced, with the medial claw smallest. The b
ony remnants of the fourth and fifth toes were
located up near the metatarsal joint. The tibia was
strong, and considerably longer than the
femur. At the hip, the acetabulum was complete. The
tail showed forty-five vertebrae. It was a
Procompsognathus.
<div class="bookquote">``Could this X-ray be faked?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``But it's almost imposs
ible to fake an X-ray. And Procompsognathus
is an obscure animal. Even people familiar with din
osaurs have never heard of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie read the note. <div class="bookquote">``Specimen acquired on the beac
h of Cabo Blanco, July 16... . Apparently a
howler monkey was eating the animal, and this was a
ll that was recovered. Oh ... and it says
the lizard attacked a little girl.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I doubt that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``But perhaps. Procompso
gnathus was so small and light we assume
it must be a scavenger, only feeding off dead creat
ures. And you can tell the size'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) measured
quickly-<div class="bookquote">``it's about twenty centimeters to the hips,
which means the full animal would be about a
foot tall. About as big as a chicken. Even a child
would look pretty fearsome to it. It might bite an
infant, but not a child.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Ellie frowned at the X-ray image. <div class="bookquote">``You think this c
ould really be a legitimate rediscovery?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``Like the coelacanth?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. The coelacanth was a five-foot
-long fish thought to have died out sixty-
five million years ago, until a specimen was pulled
from the ocean in 1938. But there were other
examples. The Australian mountain pygmy possum was
known only from fossils until a live one
was found in a garbage can in Melbourne. And a ten-
thousand-year-old fossil fruit bat from New
Guinea was described by a zoologist who not long af
terward received a living specimen in the
mail.
<div class="bookquote">``But could it be real?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) persisted. <div class="bookquote">``What about
the age?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant nodded. <div class="bookquote">``The age is a problem.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Most rediscovered animals were rather recent additi
ons to the fossil record: ten or twenty
thousand years old. Some were a few million years o
ld- in the case of the coelacanth, sixty-five
million years old. But the specimen they were looki
ng at was much, much older than that.
Dinosaurs had died out in the Cretaceous period, si
xty-five million years ago. They had flourished
as the dominant life form on the planet in the Jura
ssic, 190 million years ago. And they had first
appeared in the Triassic, roughly 220 million years
ago.
It was during the early Triassic period that Procom
psognathus had lived-a time so distant that
our planet didn't even look the same. All the conti
nents were joined together in a single
landmass, called Pangaca, which extended from the N
orth to the South Pole-a vast continent of
ferns and forests, with a few large deserts. The At
lantic Ocean was a narrow lake between what
would become Africa and Florida. The air was denser
. The land was warmer. There were
hundreds of active volcanoes. And it was in this en
vironment that Procompsognathus lived.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said. <div class="bookquote">``We know animals have survived.
Crocodiles are basically Triassic animals
living in the present. Sharks are Triassic. So we k
now it has happened before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant nodded. <div class="bookquote">``And the thing is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``how els

Grant looked at Ellie and mouthed, What's going on?
Ellie
shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) head. Sounds upset.
Grant mouthed, See if Morris is still here.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) went to the window and looked out, but Morris's
car was gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) turned back.
On the speaker, Hammond coughed. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Dr. Grant. Ha

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good, that's good. Well. Yes. I'll tell you frankl

<div class="bookquote">``Well, we've had our problems and some delays...

 (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie looked at Grant as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Hammon

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good, good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said blandly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) seemed distr

``I guess we can.''
``Good. Pack lightly. You don't need passports. I'm
looking forward to it. See you tomorrow,''
Hammond said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) hung up.
Cowan, Swain and Ross
Midday sun streamed into the San Francisco law offi
ces of Cowan, Swain and Ross, giving the
room a cheerfulness that Donald Gennaro did not fee
l. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) listened on the phone and looked at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) boss, Daniel Ross, cold as an undertaker in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
dark pinstripe suit.
``I understand, John,'' Gennaro said. ``And Grant agre
ed to come? Good, good ... yes, that
sounds fine to me. My congratulations, John.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) hu
ng up the phone and turned to Ross.
``We can't trust Hammond any more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)'s under too mu
ch pressure. The EPA's investigating
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)'s behind schedule on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) Costa Rican resort
, and the investors are getting nervous.
There have been too many rumors of problems down th
ere. Too many workmen have died. And
now this business about a living procompsit-whateve
r on the mainland ... ''
``What does that mean?'' Ross said.
``Maybe nothing,'' Gennaro said. ``But Hamachi is one
of our principal investors. I got a report
last week from Hamachi's representative in San Jos
, the capital of Costa Rica. According to the
report, some new kind of lizard is biting children
on the coast.''
Ross blinked. ``New lizard?''
``Yes,'' Gennaro said. ``We can't screw around with th
is. We've got to inspect that island right
away. I've asked Hammond to arrange independent sit
e inspections every week for the next
three weeks.''
``And what does Hammond say?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) insists nothing is wrong on the island. Claims
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) has all these security precautions.''
``But you don't believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>),'' Ross said.
``No,'' Gennaro said. ``I don't.''
Donald Gennaro had come to Cowan, Swain from a back
ground in investment banking.
Cowan, Swain's high-tech clients frequently needed
capitalization, and Gennaro helped them find
the money. One of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) first assignments, back in 19
82, had been to accompany John Hammond
while the old man, then nearly seventy, put togethe
r the funding to start the InGen corporation.
They eventually raised almost a billion dollars, an
d Gcnnaro remembered it as a wild ride.
``Hammond's a dreamer,'' Gennaro said.
``A potentially dangerous dreamer,'' Ross said. ``We s
hould never have gotten involved. What is
our financial position?''
``The firm,'' Gennaro said, ``owns five percent.''
``General or limited?''
``General.''
Ross shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) head. ``We should never have done tha
t.''
``It seemed wise at the time,'' Gennaro said. ``Hell,
it was eight years ago. We took it in lieu of
some fees. And, if you remember, Hammond's plan was
extremely speculative. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was really
pushing the envelope. Nobody really thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) coul
d pull it off.''
``But apparently he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) has,'' Ross said. ``In any case, I
agree that an inspection is overdue. What
about your site experts?''
``I'm starting with experts Hammond already hired as
consultants, early in the project.'' Gennaro
tossed a list onto Ross's desk. ``First group is a p
aleontologist, a paleobotanist, and a
mathematician. They go down this weekend. I'll go w
ith them.''
``Will they tell you the truth?'' Ross said.
``I think so. None of them had much to do with the i
sland, and one of them-the mathematician,
Ian Malcolm-was openly hostile to the project from
the start. Insisted it would never work, could
never work.''
``And who else?''
``Just a technical person: the computer system analy
st. Review the park's computers and fix
some bugs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ian</b></font>) should be there by Friday morning.<div class="bookquote">''
Fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Ross said. <div class="bookquote">``You're making the arrangements?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hammond asked to place the calls himself. I think
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) wants to pretend that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)'s not in trouble,
that it's just a social invitation. Showing off his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)
island.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ross/Daniel Ross</b></font>)</div>Ross said. <div class="bookquote">``But just make sure it happ
ens. Stay on top of it. I want this Costa Rican
situation resolved within a week.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ross/Daniel Ross</b></font>)</div>Ross got up, and
walked out of the room.
Gennaro dialed, heard the whining hiss of a radioph
one. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) heard a voice say, <div class="bookquote">``Grant
here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hi, Dr. Grant, this is Donald Gennaro. I'm the gen

<div class="bookquote">``Yes. Do you have the specimen with you, Dr. Grant?
The actual specimen?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``I've only seen an X-ray. The spe

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I wonder if you could give me the details on
that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``Then I can run down

to the island while you're all down there,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
Grant gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) the information. <div class="bookquote">``Well, that's fine,
Dr. Grant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``My regards to Dr.

Plans
<div class="bookquote">``This just came,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said the next day, walking
to the back of the trailer with a thick manila
envelope. <div class="bookquote">``One of the kids brought it back from tow
n. It's from Hammond.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant noticed the blue-and-white InGen logo as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) t
ore open the envelope. Inside there was
no cover letter, just a bound stack of paper. Pulli
ng it out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) discovered it was blueprints. They
were reduced, forming a thick book. The cover was m
arked: ISLA NUBLAR RESORT GUEST
FACILITIES -LRB-FULL SET: SAFARI LODGE-RRB-.
<div class="bookquote">``What the hell is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) flipped open the book, a sheet of paper fell
out.
Dear Alan and Ellie:
As you can imagine we don't have much in the way of
formal promotional materials yet. But
this should give you some idea of the Isla Nublar p
roject. I think it's Very exciting!
Looking forward to discussing this with you! Hope y

<div class="bookquote">``I don't get it,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Hammond</b></font>)</div>Grant said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) flipped through th
e sheets. <div class="bookquote">``These are architectural plans.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
turned to the top sheet:

Grant turned to the plans themselves. They were sta
mped INDUSTRIAL SECRETS DO NOT
COPY and CONFIDENTIAL WORK PRODUCT-NOT FOR DISTRIBU
TION. Each sheet was
numbered, and at the top: <div class="bookquote">``These plans represent th
e confidential creations of InGen Inc.. You
must have signed document 112/4A or you risk prosec
ution.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Looks pretty paranoid to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe there's a reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said.
The next page was a topographical map. It showed Is
la Nublar as an inverted teardrop,
bulging at the north, tapering at the south. The is
land was eight miles long, and the map divided it
into several large sections.
The northern section was marked VISITOR AREA and it
contained structures marked <div class="bookquote">``Visitor
Arrivals,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Visitor Center/Administration,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">'' Power
/Desalinization/Support,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hammond Res.,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>and
<div class="bookquote">``Safari Lodge.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant could see the outline of a sw
imming pool, the rectangles of tennis courts,
and the round squiggles that represented planting a
nd shrubbery.
<div class="bookquote">``Looks like a resort, all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said.
There followed detail sheets for the Safari Lodge i
tself. In the elevation sketches, the lodge
looked dramatic: a long low building with a series
of pyramid shapes on the roof. But there was
little about the other buildings in the visitor are
a.
And the rest of the island was even more mysterious
. As far as Grant could tell, it was mostly
open space. A network of roads, tunnels, and outlyi
ng buildings, and a long thin lake that
appeared to be man-made, with concrete dams and bar
riers. But, for the most part, the island
was divided into big curving areas with very little
development at all. Each area was marked by
codes:
/P/PROC/V/2A, /D/TRIC/L/5-LRB-4A+I-RRB-, /LN/OTHN/C/4-LRB-3A+-RSB--RRB-
, and /VV/ HADR/X/ 11-LRB-6A + 3 + 3DB-RRB-.
<div class="bookquote">``Is there an explanation for the codes?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said.
Grant flipped the pages rapidly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) couldn't fi
nd one.
<div class="bookquote">``Maybe they took it out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm telling you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``Paranoid.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) looke
d at the big curving divisions, separated from
one another by the network of roads. There were onl
y six divisions on the whole island. And each
division was separated from the road by a concrete
moat. Outside each moat was a fence with a
little lightning sign alongside it. That mystified
them until they were finally able to figure out It
meant the fences were electrified.
<div class="bookquote">``That's odd,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Electrified fences at a re
sort?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Miles of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``Electrified fences an
d moats, together. And usually with a road
alongside them as well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just like a zoo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said.
They went back to the topographical map and looked
closely at the contour lines. The roads
had been placed oddly. The main road ran north-sout
b, right through the central hills of the
island, including one section of road that seemed t
o be literally cut into the side of a cliff, above
a
river. It began to look as if there had been a deli
berate effort to leave these open areas as big
enclosures, separated from the roads by moats and e
lectric fences. And the roads were raised
up above ground level, so you could see over the fe
nces...
<div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said, <div class="bookquote">``some of these dimensions a
re enormous. Look at this. This concrete
moat is thirty feet wide. That's like a military fo
rtification.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So are these buildings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had notice
d that each open division had a few
buildings, usually located in out-of-the-way corner
s. But the buildings were all concrete, with thick
walls. In side-view elevations they looked like con
crete bunkers with small windows. Like the Nazi
pillboxes from old war movies.
At that moment, they heard a muffled explosion, and
Grant put the papers aside. <div class="bookquote">``Back to
work,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Fire!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a slight vibration, and then yellow conto
ur lines traced across the computer screen.
This time the resolution was perfect, and Alan Gran
t had a glimpse of the skeleton, beautifully
defined, the long neck arched back. It was unquesti
onably an infant velociraptor, and it looked in
perfect-
The screen went blank.
<div class="bookquote">``I hate computers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said, squinting in the su
n. <div class="bookquote">``What happened now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lost the integrator input,''  (<font color='red'><b>the kids</b></font>)</div>one of the kids said.
<div class="bookquote">``Just a minute.''  (<font color='red'><b>The kid computer</b></font>)</div>The kid bent to look at the
tangle of wires going into the back of the battery-
powered portable computer. They had set the
computer up on a beer carton on top of Hill Four, n
ot far from the device they called Thumper.
Grant sat down on the side of the hill and looked a
t his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) watch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said to Ellie, <div class="bookquote">``We're going to
have to do this the old-fashioned way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>One of the kids overheard. <div class="bookquote">``Aw, Alan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said, <div class="bookquote">``I've got a plane to catch. And
I want the fossil protected before I go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Once you began to expose a fossil, you had to conti
nue, or risk losing it. Visitors imagined the
landscape of the badlands to be unchanging, but in
fact it was continuously eroding, literally right
before your eyes; all day long you could hear the c
latter of pebbles rolling down the crumbling
hillside. And there was always the risk of a rainst
orm; even a brief shower would wash away a
delicate fossil. Thus Grant's partially exposed ske
leton was at risk, and it had to be protected until

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) returned.
Fossil protection ordinarily consisted of a tarp ov
er the site, and a trench around the perimeter
to control water runoff. The question was how large
a trench the velociraptor fossil required. To
decide that, they were using computer-assisted soni
c tomography, or CAST. This was a new
procedure, in which Thumper fired a soft lead slug
into the ground, setting up shock waves that
were read by the computer and assembled into a kind
of X-ray image of the hillside. They had
been using it all summer with varying results.
Thumper was twenty feet away now, a big silver box
on wheels, with an umbrella on top. It
looked like an ice-cream vendor's pushcart, parked
incongruously on the badlands. Thumper had
two youthful attendants loading the next soft lead
pellet.
So far, the CAST program merely located the extent
of finds, helping Grant's team to dig more
efficiently. But the kids claimed that within a few
years it would be possible to generate an image
so detailed that excavation would he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) redundant. You
could get a perfect image of the bones, in
three dimensions, and it promised a whole new era o
f archaeology without excavation.
But none of that had happened yet. And the equipmen
t that worked flawlessly in the university
laboratory proved pitifully delicate and fickle in
the field.
<div class="bookquote">``How much longer?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
<div class="bookquote">``We got it now, Alan. It's not bad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant went to look at the computer screen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) complete skeleton, traced in bright
yellow. It was indeed a young specimen. The outstan
ding characteristic of Velociraptor-the
single-toed claw, which in a full-grown animal was
a curved, six-inch-long weapon capable of
ripping open its prey-was in this infant no larger
than the thorn on a rosebush. It was hardly
visible at all on the screen. And Velociraptor was
a lightly built dinosaur in any case, an animal as
fine-boned as a bird, and presumably as intelligent
.
Here the skeleton appeared in perfect order, except
that the head and neck were bent back,
toward the posterior. Such neck flexion was so comm
on in fossils that some scientists had
formulated a theory to explain it, suggesting that
the dinosaurs had become extinct because they
had been poisoned by the evolving alkaloids in plan
ts. The twisted neck was thought to signify
the death agony of the dinosaurs. Grant had finally
put that one to rest, by demonstrating that
many species of birds and reptiles underwent a post
mortem contraction of posterior neck
ligaments, which bent the head backward in a charac
teristic way. It had nothing to do with the
cause of death; it had to do with the way a carcass
dried in the sun.
Grant saw that this particular skeleton had also be
en twisted laterally, so that the right leg and
foot were raised up above the backbone.
<div class="bookquote">``It looks kind of distorted,''  (<font color='red'><b>the kids</b></font>)</div>one of the kids said.
<div class="bookquote">``But I don't think it's the computer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``It's just time. Lots and lots of
time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant knew that people could not imagine geological
time. Human life was lived on another
scale of time entirely. An apple turned brown in a
few minutes. Silverware turned black in a few
days. A compost heap decayed in a season. A child g
rew up in a decade. None of these
everyday human experiences prepared people to be ab
le to imagine the meaning of eighty
million years - the length of time that had passed
since this little animal had died.
In the classroom, Grant had tried different compari
sons. If you imagined the human lifespan of
sixty years was compressed to an hour, then eighty
million years would still be 3,652 years-older
than the pyramids. The velociraptor had been dead a
long time.
<div class="bookquote">``Doesn't look very fearsome,''  (<font color='red'><b>the kids</b></font>)</div>one of the kids said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) wasn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``At least, not until he (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) gr
ew up.''  (<font color='red'><b>this baby</b></font>)</div>Probably this baby had scavenged,
feeding off carcasses slain by the adults, after th
e big animals had gorged themselves, and lay
basking in the sun. Carnivores could eat as much as
25 percent of their body weight in a single
meal, and it made them sleepy afterward. The babies
would chitter and scramble over the
indulgent, somnolent bodies of the adults, and nip
little bites from the dead animal. The babies
were probably cute little animals.
But an adult velociraptor was another matter entire
ly. Pound for pound, a velociraptor was the
most rapacious dinosaur that ever lived. Although r
elatively small-about two hundred pounds, the
size of a leopard-velociraptors were quick, intelli
gent, and vicious, able to attack with sharp jaws,
powerful clawed forearms, and the devastating singl
e claw on the foot.
Velociraptors hunted in packs, and Grant thought it
must have been a sight to see a dozen of
these animals racing at full speed, leaping onto th
e back of a much larger dinosaur, tearing at the
neck and slashing at the ribs and belly...
<div class="bookquote">``We're running out of time,''  (<font color='red'><b>a dozen</b></font>)</div>Ellie said, bringing h
im back.
Grant gave instructions for the trench. From the co
mputer image, they knew the skeleton lay in
a relatively confined area; a ditch around a two-me
ter square would be sufficient. Meanwhile,
Ellie lashed down the tarp that covered the side of
the hill. Grant helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) pound in the final
stakes.
<div class="bookquote">``How did the baby die?''  (<font color='red'><b>the kids</b></font>)</div>one of the kids asked.
<div class="bookquote">``I doubt we'll know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant replied. <div class="bookquote">``Infant mortal
ity in the wild is high. In African parks, it runs
seventy percent among some carnivores. It could hav
e been anything - disease, separation from
the group, anything. Or even attack by an adult. We
know these animals hunted in packs, but we
don't know anything about their social behavior in
a group.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The students</b></font>)</div>The students nodded. They had all studied animal be
havior, and they knew, for example, that
when a new male took over a lion pride, the first t
hing he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) did was kill all the cubs. The reason
was apparently genetic: the male had evolved to dis
seminate his (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) genes as widely as possible,
and by killing the cubs he (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) brought all the females
into heat, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) could impregnate them. It
also prevented the females from wasting their time
nurturing the offspring of another male.
Perhaps the velociraptor hunting pack was also rule
d by a dominant male. They knew so little
about dinosaurs, Grant thought. After 150 years of
research and excavation all around the world,
they still knew almost nothing about what the dinos
aurs had really been like.
<div class="bookquote">``We've got to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said, <div class="bookquote">``if we're going to g

Gennaro's secretary bustled in with a new suitcase.
It still had the sales tags on it. <div class="bookquote">``You know,
Mr. Gennaro,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said severely, <div class="bookquote">``when you forget t

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe you're right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm missing my

<div class="bookquote">``Well, I did the best I could on short notice,''  (<font color='red'><b>secretary</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amanda</b></font>) left. Gennaro walked down the hallway, tearing
the sales tags off the suitcase. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
passed the all-glass conference room, Dan Ross left
the table and came outside.
<div class="bookquote">``Have a good trip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ross/Daniel Ross</b></font>)</div>Ross said. <div class="bookquote">``But let's be very c

 (<font color='red'><b>Ross/Daniel Ross</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Screw Hammond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ross/Daniel Ross</b></font>)</div>Ross said.
<div class="bookquote">``My boy, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the familiar raspy voice said. <div class="bookquote">``H

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro replied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) leaned back i

<div class="bookquote">``You never call me any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said reproach
fully. <div class="bookquote">``I've missed you, Donald. How is

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wonderful, wonderful. Children are such a delight.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'d get a kick out of our new park in
Costa Rica.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro had forgotten how short Hammond was; as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)
sat in the chair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) feet didn't touch
the carpeting-he swung his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) legs as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) talked. There
was a childlike quality to the man, even
though Hammond must now be ... what? Seventy-five
? Seventy-six? Something like that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)
looked older than Gennaro remembered, but then, Gen
naro hadn't seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) for almost five
years.
Hammond was flamboyant, a born showman, and back in
1983 he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) had had an elephant that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) carried around with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) in a little cage. The el
ephant was nine inches high and a foot long,
and perfectly formed, except his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) tusks were stunted
. Hammond took the elephant with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) to
fund-raising meetings. Gennaro usually carried it i
nto the room, the cage covered with a little
blanket, like a tea cozy, and Hammond would give hi
s usual speech about the prospects for
developing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">``consumer biologicals.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>T
hen, at the dramatic moment, Hammond
would whip away the blanket to reveal the elephant.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) would ask for money.
The elephant was always a rousing success; its tiny
body, hardly bigger than a cat's, promised
untold wonders to come from the laboratory of Norma
n Atherton, the Stanford geneticist who was
Hammond's partner in the new venture.
But as Hammond talked about the elephant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) left a
great deal unsaid. For example,
Hammond was starting a genetics company, but the ti
ny elephant hadn't been made by any
genetic procedure; Atherton had simply taken a dwar
f-elephant embryo and raised it in an
artificial womb with hormonal modifications. That i
n itself was quite an achievement, but nothing
like what Hammond hinted had been done.
Also, Atherton hadn't been able to duplicate his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) mi
niature elephant, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)'d tried. For one
thing, everybody who saw the elephant wanted one. T
hen, too, the elephant was prone to colds,
particularly during winter. The sneezes coming thro
ugh the little trunk filled Hammond with dread.
And sometimes the elephant would get his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) tusks stuc
k between the bars of the cage and snort
irritably as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) tried to get free; sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) got
infections around the tusk line. Hammond
always fretted that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) elephant would die before A
therton could grow a replacement.
Hammond also concealed from prospective investors t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) fact that the elephant's behavior had
changed substantially in the process of miniaturiza
tion. The little creature might look like an
elephant, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) acted like a vicious rodent, quick
-moving and mean-tempered. Hammond
discouraged people from petting the elephant, to av
oid nipped fingers.
And although Hammond spoke confidently of seven bil
lion dollars in annual revenues by 1993,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) project was intensely speculative. Hammond had
vision and enthusiasm, but there was no
certainty that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) plan would work at all. Particul
arly since Norman Atherton, the brains behind the
project, bad terminal cancer-which was a final poin
t Hammond neglected to mention.
Even so, with Gennaro's help, Hammond got his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) money
. Between September of 1983 and
November of 1985, John Alfred Hammond and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Pach
yderm Portfolio''  (<font color='red'><b>John Alfred Hammond Portfolio</b></font>)</div>raised $870 million in
venture capital to finance his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) proposed corporation
, International Genetic Technologies, Inc.. And
they could have raised more, except Hammond insiste
d on absolute secrecy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) offered no
return on capital for at least five years. That sca
red a lot of investors off. In the end, they'd had
to
take mostly Japanese consortia. The Japanese were t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) only investors who had the patience.
Sitting in the leather chair of the jet, Gennaro th
ought about how evasive Hammond was. The old
man was now ignoring the fact that Gennaro's law fi
rm had forced this trip on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>). Instead,
Hammond behaved as if they were engaged in a purely
social outing. <div class="bookquote">``It's too bad you didn't
bring your family with you, Donald,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) said .
Gennaro shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``It's my daughter's birthday. Twe
nty kids already scheduled. The cake and
the clown. You know how it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said. <div class="bookquote">``Kids set their h
earts on things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anyway, is the park ready for visitors?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro a
sked.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, not officially,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said. <div class="bookquote">``But the hote
l is built, so there is a place to stay...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the animals?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course, the animals are all there. All in their
spaces.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said, <div class="bookquote">``I remember in the original proposal
you were hoping for a total of twelve...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ob, we're far beyond that. We have two hundred and
thirty-eight an`mals, Donald.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Two hundred and thirty-eight?''
The old man giggled, pleased at Gennaro's reaction.
``You can't imagine it. We have herds of
them.''
``Two hundred and thirty-eight ... How many specie
s?''
``Fifteen different species, Donald.''
``That's incredible,'' Gennaro said. ``That's fantasti
c. And what about all the other things you
wanted? The facilities? The computers?''
``All of it, all of it,'' Hammond said. ``Everything o
n that island is state-of-the-art. You'll see for
yourself, Donald. It's perfectly wonderful. That's
why this ... concern ... is so misplaced. There
's
absolutely no problem with the island.''
Gennaro said, ``Then there should be absolutely no p
roblem with an inspection.''
``And there isn't,'' Hammond said. ``But it slows thin
gs down. Everything has to stop for the
official visit...''
``You've had delays anyway. You've postponed the ope
ning.''
``Oh, that '' Hammond tugged at the red silk handkerc
hief in the breast pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) sportcoat.
``It was bound to happen. Bound to happen.''
``Why?'' Gennaro asked.
``Well, Donald,'' Hammond said, ``to explain that, you
have to go back to the initial concept of
the resort. The concept of the most advanced amusem
ent park in the world, combining the latest
electronic and biological technologies. I'm not tal
king about rides. Everybody has rides. Coney
Island has rides. And these days everybody has anim
atronic environments. The haunted house,
the pirate den, the wild west, the earthquake-every
one has those things. So we set out to make
biological attractions. Living attractions. Attract
ions so astonishing they would capture the
imagination of the entire world.''
Gennaro had to smile. It was almost the same speech
, word for word, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) had used on the
investors, so many years ago. ``And we can never for
get the ultimate object of the project in
Costa Rica-to make money,'' Hammond said, staring ou
t the windows of the jet. ``Lots and lots of
money.
<div class="bookquote">``I remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``And the secret to making money in a park,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond
said, <div class="bookquote">``is to limit your Personnel costs.
The food handlers, ticket takers, cleanup crews, re
pair teams. To make a park that runs with
minimal staff. That was why we invested in all the
computer technology-we automated wherever
we could.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I remember...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But the plain fact is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said, when you put
together all the animals and all the
computer systems, you run into snags. Who ever got
a major computer system up and running
on schedule? Nobody I know.''
``So you've just had normal start-up delays?''
``Yes, that's right,'' Hammond said. <div class="bookquote">``Normal delays.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard there were accidents during construction,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``Some workmen died...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there were several accidents,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said.
<div class="bookquote">``And a total of three deaths. Two workers

<div class="bookquote">``Donald,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``believe me when I tell you that
everything on the island is going forward as

please. We're landing in Choteau.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The pilot</b></font>)</div>Choteau
Dry plains stretched away toward distant black butt
es. The afternoon wind blew dust and
tumbleweed across the cracked concrete. Grant stood
with Ellie near the Jeep and waited while
the sleek Grumman jet circled for a landing.
<div class="bookquote">``I hate to wait on the money men,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant grumbled.
Ellie shrugged.<div class="bookquote">``Goes with the job.''
 (<font color='red'><b>patrons</b></font>)</div>Although many fields of science, such as physics an
d chemistry, had become federally funded,
paleontology remained strongly dependent on private
patrons. Quite apart from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) own curiosity
about the island in Costa Rica, Grant understood th
at, if John Hammond asked for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) help, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)
would give it. That was how patronage worked-how it
had always worked.
The little jet landed and rolled quickly toward the
m. Ellie shouldered her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) bag. The iet came to a
stop and a stewardess in a blue uniform opened the
door.
Inside, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was surprised at how cramped it was, des
pite the luxurious appointments. Grant
had to hunch over as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) went to shake Hammond's han
d.
<div class="bookquote">``Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler,''  (<font color='red'><b>han</b></font>)</div>Hammond said. <div class="bookquote">``It's go
od of you to join us. Allow me to introduce
my associate, Donald Gennaro.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro was a stocky, muscular man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) mid-thirt
ies wearing an Armani suit and wire-frame
glasses. Grant disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) on sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) shook hand
s quickly. When Ellie shook hands, Gennaro
said in surprise, <div class="bookquote">``You're a woman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``These things happen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said, and Grant thought:
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) doesn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), either-
Hammond turned to Gennaro. <div class="bookquote">``You know, of course, wh
at Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler do. They
are paleontologists. They dig up dinosaurs.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And th
en he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) began to laugh, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) found the idea
very funny.
<div class="bookquote">``Take your seats, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stewardess</b></font>)</div>the stewardess said, clo
sing the door. Immediately the plane began to
move.
<div class="bookquote">``You'll have to excuse us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said, <div class="bookquote">``but we a
re in a bit of a rush. Donald thinks it's
important we get right down there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>The pilot announced four hours' flying time to Dall
as, where they would refuel, and then go on
to Costa Rica, arriving the following morning.
<div class="bookquote">``And how long will we be in Costa Rica?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant aske
d.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, that really depends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``We have
a few things to clear up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Take my word for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said, turning to Gra

 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant buckled his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) seat belt. <div class="bookquote">``This island of yours

 (<font color='red'><b>directors</b></font>)</div>Target of Opportunity
The Biosyn Corporation of Cupertino, California, ha
d never called an emergency meeting of its
board of directors. The ten directors now sitting i
n the conference room were irritable and
impatient. It was 8:00 p.m.. They had been talking a
mong themselves for the last ten minutes, but
slowly had fallen silent. Shuffling papers. Looking
pointedly at their watches.
<div class="bookquote">``What are we waiting for?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>one asked.
<div class="bookquote">``One more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dodgson/Lewis Dodgson</b></font>)</div>Lewis Dodgson said. <div class="bookquote">``We need one more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) watch. Ron Meyer's
office had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) was coming up on the six o'clock
plane from San Diego. He (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) should be here by
now, even allowing for traffic from the airport.
<div class="bookquote">``You need a quorum?''  (<font color='red'><b>another director</b></font>)</div>another director asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dodgson/Lewis Dodgson</b></font>)</div>Dodgson said. <div class="bookquote">``We do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That shut them up for a moment. A quorum meant that
they were going to be asked to make
an important decision. And God knows they were, alt
hough Dodgson would have preferred not to
call a meeting at all. But Steingarten, the head of
Biosyn, was adamant. <div class="bookquote">``You'll have to get their
agreement for this one, Lew,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) had said.
Depending on who you talked to, Lewis Dodgson was f
amous as the most aggressive
geneticist of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) generation, or the most reckless.
Thirty-four, balding, hawk-faced, and intense,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) had been dismissed by Johns Hopkins as a graduat
e student, for planning gene therapy on
human patients without obtaining the proper FDA pro
tocols. Hired by Biosyn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) had conducted
the controversial rabies vaccine test in Chile. Now
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) was the head of product development at
Biosyn, which supposedly consisted of <div class="bookquote">``reverse engi
neering'' (<font color='red'><b>Biosyn</b></font>)</div>: taking a competitor's product,
tearing it apart, learning how it worked, and then
making your own version. In practice, it involved
industrial espionage, much of it directed toward th
e InGen corporation.
In the 1980s, a few genetic engineering companies b
egan to ask, <div class="bookquote">``What is the biological
equivalent of a Sony Walkman?''  (<font color='red'><b>companies</b></font>)</div>These companies were
n't interested in pharmaceuticals or
health; they were interested in entertainment, spor
ts, leisure activities, cosmetics, and pets. The
perceived demand for <div class="bookquote">``consumer biologicals''  (<font color='red'><b>InGen/InGen Inc.</b></font>)</div>in the
1990s was high. InGen and Biosyn were
both at work in this field.
Biosyn had already achieved some success, engineeri
ng a new, pale trout under contract to
the Department of Fish and Game of the State of Ida
ho. This trout was easier to spot in streams,
and was said to represent a step forward in angling
. -LRB-At least, it eliminated complaints to the Fish
and Came Department that there were no trout in the
streams.-RRB- The fact that the pale trout
sometimes died of sunburn, and that its flesh was s
oggy and tasteless, was not discussed.
Biosyn was still working on that, and-
The door opened and Ron Meyer entered the room, sli
pped into a seat. Dodgson now had his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>)
quorum. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) immediately stood.
<div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``we're here tonight to consid
er a target of opportunity: InGen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Dodgson quickly reviewed the background. InGen's st
art-up in 1983, with Japanese investors.
The purchase of three Cray XMP supercomputers. The
purchase of Isla Nublar in Costa Rica.
The stockpiling of amber. The unusual donations to
zoos around the world, from the New York
Zoological Society to the Rantbapur Wildlife Park i
n India.
<div class="bookquote">``Despite all these clues,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dodgson/Lewis Dodgson</b></font>)</div>Dodgson said, ``we still
had no idea where InGen might be going. The
company seemed obviously focused on animals; and th
ey had hired researchers with an interest in
the past-paleoblologists, DNA phylogeneticists, and
so on.
``Then, in 1987, InGen bought an obscure company cal
led Millipore Plastic Products in
Nashville, Tennessee. This was an agribusiness comp
any that had recently patented a new
plastic with the characteristics of an avian eggshe
ll. This plastic could be shaped into an egg and
used to grow chick embryos. Starting the following
year, InGen took the entire output of this
millipore plastic for its own use.''
``Dr. Dodgson, this is all very interesting-''
``At the same time,'' Dodgson continued, ``constructio
n was begun on Isla Nublar, This involved
massive earthworks, including a shallow lake two mi
les long, in the center of the island. Plans for
resort facilities were let out with a high degree o
f confidentiality, but it appears that InGen has
built a private zoo of large dimensions on the isla
nd.''
One of the directors leaned forward and said, ``Dr.
Dodgson. So what?''
``It's not an ordinary zoo,'' Dodgson said. ``This zoo
is unique in the world. It seems that InGen
has done something quite extraordinary. They have m
anaged to clone extinct animals from the
past.''
``What animals?''
``Animals that hatch from eggs, and that require a l
ot of room in a zoo.''
``What animals?''
``Dinosaurs,'' Dodgson said. ``They are cloning dinosa
urs.''
The consternation that followed was entirely mispla
ced, in Dodgson's view. The trouble with
money men was that they didn't keep up: they had in
vested in a field, but they didn't know what
was possible.
In fact, there had been discussion of cloning dinos
aurs in the technical literature as far back as
1982. With each passing year, the manipulation of D
NA had grown easier. Genetic material had
already been extracted from Egyptian mummies, and f
rom the hide of a quagga, a zebra-like
African animal that had become extinct in the 1880s
. By 1985, it seemed possible that quagga
DNA might be reconstituted, and a new animal grown.
If so, it would be the first creature brought
back from extinction solely by reconstruction of it
s DNA. If that was possible, what else was also
possible? The mastodon? The saber-toothed tiger? Th
e dodo?
Or even a dinosaur?
Of course, no dinosaur DNA was known to exist anywh
ere in the world. But by grinding up
large quantities of dinosaur bones it might be poss
ible to extract fragments of DNA. Formerly it
was thought that fossilization eliminated all DNA.
Now that was recognized as untrue. If enough
DNA fragments were recovered, it might be possible
to clone a living animal.
Back in 1982, the technical problems had seemed dau
nting. But there was no theoretical
barrier. It was merely difficult, expensive, and un
likely to work, Yet it was certainly possible, if
anyone cared to try.
InGen had apparently decided to try.
``What they have done,'' Dodgson said, ``is build the
greatest single tourist attraction in the
history of the world. As you know, zoos are extreme
ly popular. Last year, more Americans visited
zoos than all professional baseball and football ga
mes combined. And the Japanese love zoos-
there are fifty zoos in Japan, and more being built
. And for this zoo, InGen can charge whatever
they want, Two thousand dollars a day, ten thousand
dollars a day ... And then there is the
merchandising. The picture books, T-shirts, video g
ames, caps, stuffed toys, comic books, and
pets.''
``Pets?''
``Of course. If InGen can make full-size dinosaurs,
they can also make pygmy dinosaurs as
household pets. What child won't want a little dino
saur as a pet? A little patented animal for their
very own. InGen will sell millions of them. And InG
en will engineer them so that these pet
dinosaurs can only eat InGen pet food...''
``Jesus,'' somebody said.
``Exactly,'' Dodgson said. ``The zoo is the centerpiec
e of an enormous enterprise.''
``You said these dinosaurs will be patented?''
``Yes. Genetically engineered animals can now be pat
ented. The Supreme Court ruled on that
in favor of Harvard in 1987. InGen will own its din
osaurs, and no one else can legally make
them.''
``What prevents us from creating our own dinosaurs?''
someone said.
``Nothing, except that they have a five-year start.
It'll be almost impossible to catch up before
the end of the century.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) paused. ``Of course, if we could obtain examples
of their dinosaurs, we could reverse
engineer them and make our own, with enough modific
ations in the DNA to evade their patents.''
``Can we obtain examples of their dinosaurs?''
Dodgson paused. ``I believe we can, yes.''
Somebody cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) throat. ``There wouldn't be any
thing illegal about it...''
``Oh no,'' Dodgson said quickly. ``Nothing illegal. I'
m talking about a legitimate source of their
DNA. A disgruntled employee, or some trash improper
ly disposed of, something like that.''
``Do you have a legitimate source, Dr. Dodgson?''
``I do,'' Dodgson said. ``But I'm afraid there is some
urgency to the decision, because InGen is
experiencing a small crisis, and my source will hav
e to act within the next twenty-four hours.''
A long silence descended over the room. The men loo
ked at the secretary, taking notes, and
the tape recorder on the table in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
``I don't see the need for a formal resolution on th
is,'' Dodgson said. ``Just a sense of the room,
as to whether you feel I should proceed...''
Slowly the heads nodded.
Nobody spoke. Nobody went on record. They just nodd
ed silently.
``Thank you for coming, gentlemen,'' Dodgson said. ``I
'll take it from here.''
Airport
Lewis Dodgson entered the coffee shop in the depart
ure building of the San Francisco airport
and looked around quickly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) man was already ther
e, waiting at the counter. Dodgson sat down
next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) and placed the briefcase on the floor b
etween them.
``You're late, pal,'' the man said. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at the
straw hat Dodgson was wearing and laughed.
``What is this supposed to be, a disguise?''
``You never know,'' Dodgson said, suppressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) ang
er. For six months, Dodgson had
patiently cultivated this man, who had grown more o
bnoxious and arrogant with each meeting.
But there was nothing Dodgson could do about tbat-b
oth men knew exactly what the stakes
were.
Bioengineered DNA was, weight for weight, the most
valuable material in the world. A single
microscopic bacterium, too small to see with the na
ked eye, but containing the genes for a heart-
attack enzyme, streptokinase, or for <div class="bookquote">``ice-minus,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>w
hich prevented frost damage to crops, might
be worth five billion dollars to the right buyer.
And that fact of life had created a bizarre new wor
ld of industrial espionage. Dodgson was
especially skilled at it. In 1987, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) convinced a d
isgruntled geneticist to quit Cetus for Biosyn, and

<p/>take five strains of engineered bacteria with her (<font color='blue'><b>Biosyn</b></font>).
The geneticist simply put a drop of each on the
fingernails of one hand, and walked out the door.
But InGen presented a tougher challenge. Dodgson wa
nted more than bacterial DNA; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>)
wanted frozen embryos, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) knew InGen guarded it
s embryos with the most elaborate
security measures. To obtain them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) needed an InG
en employee who had access to the
embryos, who was willing to steal them, and who cou
ld defeat the security. Such a person was
not easy to find.
Dodgson had finally located a susceptible InGen emp
loyee earlier in the year. Although this
particular person had no access to genetic material
, Dodgson kept up the contact, meeting the
man monthly at Carlos and Charlie's in Silicon Vall
ey, helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) in small ways. And now that
InGen was inviting contractors and advisers to visi
t the island, it was the moment that Dodgson
had been waiting for-because it meant his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) man would
have access to embryos.
<div class="bookquote">``Let's get down to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man said. <div class="bookquote">``I've got ten
minutes before my flight,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dodgson/Lewis Dodgson</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You want to go over it again?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dodgson/Lewis Dodgson</b></font>)</div>Dodgson said.
<div class="bookquote">``Hell no, Dr. Dodgson,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man said. <div class="bookquote">``I want to se
e the damn money.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dodgson/Lewis Dodgson</b></font>)</div>Dodgson flipped the latch on the briefcase and open
ed it a few inches. The man glanced down
casually. <div class="bookquote">``That's all of it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's half of it. Seven hundred fifty thousand do
llars.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay. Fine.''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man turned away, drank his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coffee
. <div class="bookquote">``That's fine, Dr. Dodgson.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dodgson/Lewis Dodgson</b></font>)</div>Dodgson quickly locked the briefcase. <div class="bookquote">``That's for a
ll fifteen species, you remember.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I remember. Fifteen species, frozen embryos. And h
ow am I going to transport them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dodgson/Lewis Dodgson</b></font>)</div>Dodgson handed the man a large can of Gillette Foam
y shaving cream.
<div class="bookquote">``That's it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``That's

<p/>it.''
``They may check my luggage...''
Dodgson shrugged. ``Press the top,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) said.
The man pressed it, and white shaving cream puffed
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) hand. ``Not bad.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) wiped the
foam on the edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) plate. ``Not bad.''
``The can's a little heavier than usual, is all.'' Do
dgson's technical team had been assembling it
around the clock for the last two days. Quickly he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>)
showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) how it worked.
``How much coolant gas is inside?''
``Enough for thirty-six hours. The embryos have to b
e back in San Jos by then.''
``That's up to your guy in the boat,'' the man said.
``Better make sure he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) has a portable cooler
on board.''
``I'll do that,'' Dodgson said.
``And let's just review the bidding...''
``The deal is the same,'' Dodgson said. ``Fifty thousa
nd on delivery of each embryo. If they're
viable, an additional fifty thousand each.''
``That's fine. Just make sure you have the boat wait
ing at the east dock of the island, Friday
night. Not the north dock, Where the big supply boa
ts arrive. The east dock. It's a small utility
dock. You got that?''
``I got it,'' Dodgson said. ``When will you be back in
San Jos?''
``Probably Sunday.'' The man pushed away from the cou
nter.
Dodgson fretted. ``You're sure you know how to work
the-''
``I know,'' the man said. ``Believe me, I know.''
``Also,'' Dodgson said, ``we think the island maintain
s constant radio contact with InGen
corporate headquarters in California, so-''
``Look, I've got it covered,'' the man said. ``Just re
lax, and get the money ready. I want it all
Sunday morning, in San Jos airport, in cash.''
``It'll be waiting for you,'' Dodgson said. ``Don't wo
rry.''
Malcolm
Shortly before midnight, be stepped on the plane at
the Dallas airport, a tall, thin, balding man of
thirty-five, dressed entirely in black: black shirt
, black trousers, black socks, black sneakers.
``Ah, Dr. Malcolm,'' Hammond said, smiling with force
d graciousness.
Malcolm grinned. ``Hello, John. Yes, I am afraid you
r old nemesis is here.''
Malcolm shook bands with everyone, saying quickly,
``Ian Malcolm, how do you do? I do
maths.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) struck Grant as being more amused by the
outing than anything else.
Certainly Grant recognized his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) name. Ian Malcolm wa
s one of the most famous of the new
generation of mathematicians who were openly intere
sted in ``how the real world works.'' These
scholars broke with the cloistered tradition of mat
hematics in several important ways. For one
thing, they used computers constantly, a practice t
raditional mathematicians frowned on. For
another, they worked almost exclusively with nonlin
ear equations, in the emerging field called
chaos theory. For a third, they appeared to care th
at their mathematics described something that
actually existed in the real world. And finally, as
if to emphasize their emergence from academia
into the world, they dressed and spoke with what on
e senior mathematician called ``a deplorable
excess of personality.'' In fact, they often behaved
like rock stars.
Malcolm sat in one of the padded chairs. The stewar
dess asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) wanted a drink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>)
said, ``Diet Coke, shaken not stirred.''
Humid Dallas air drifted through the open door. Ell
ie said, ``Isn't it a little warm for black?''
``You're extremely pretty, Dr. Sattler,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) said. ``I
could look at your legs all day. But no, as a
matter of fact, black is an excellent Color for hea
t. If you remember your black-body radiation,
black is actually best in heat. Efficient radiation
. In any case, I wear only two colors, black and
gray.''
Ellie was staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) mouth open. ``These co
lors are appropriate for any occasion,<div class="bookquote">''
Malcolm continued, and they go well together, shoul
d I mistakenly put on a pair of gray socks
with my black trousers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But don't you find it boring to wear only two colo
rs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. I find it liberating. I believe my lif
e has value, and I don't want to waste it thinking
about clothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to thi
nk about what I will wear in the morning. Truly,
can you imagine anything more boring than fashion?
Professional sports, perhaps. Grown men
swatting little balls, while the rest of the world
pays money to applaud. But, on the whole, I find
fashion even more tedious than sports.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Malcolm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond explained, <div class="bookquote">``is a man of stro
ng opinions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And mad as a hatter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said cheerfully. ``Bu
t you must admit, these are nontrivial
issues. We live in a world of frightful givens. It
is given that you will behave like this, given that

<p/>you will care about that. No one thinks about the g
ivens. Isn't it amazing? In the information
society, nobody thinks. We expected to banish paper
, but we actually banished thought.''
Hammond turned to Gennaro and raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) hands. ``Yo
u invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>).''
``And a lucky thing, too,'' Malcolm said. ``Because it
sounds as if you have a serious problem.''
``We have no problem,'' Hammond said quickly.
``I always maintained this island would be unworkabl
e,'' Malcolm said. ``I predicted it from the
beginning.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) reached into a soft leather briefcas
e. ``And I trust by now we all know what the
eventual outcome is going to be. You're going to ha
ve to shut the thing down.''
``Shut it down!'' Hammond stood angrily. ``This is rid
iculous.''
Malcolm shrugged, indifferent to Hammond's outburst
. ``I've brought copies of my original
paper for you to took at,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) said. ``The original c
onsultancy paper I did for InGen. The
mathematics are a bit sticky, but I can walk you th
rough it. Are you leaving now?''
``I have some phone calls to make,'' Hammond said, an
d went into the adjoining cabin.
``Well, it's a long flight,'' Malcolm said to the oth
ers. ``At least my paper will give you something
to do.''
The plane flew through the night.
Grant knew that Ian Malcolm had his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) share of detrac
tors, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) could understand why some
found his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) style too abrasive, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) applications
of chaos theory too glib. Grant thumbed through
the paper, glancing at the equations.
Gennaro said, ``Your paper concludes that Hammond's
island is bound to fail?''
``Correct.''
``Because of chaos theory?''
``Correct. To be more precise, because of the behavi
or of the system in phase space.''
Gennaro tossed the paper aside and said, ``Can you e
xplain this in English?''
``Surely,'' Malcolm said. ``Let's see where we have to
start.You know what a nonlinear equation
is?''
``No.''
``Strange attractors?''
``No.''
``All right,'' Malcolm said. ``Let's go back to the be
ginning.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) paused, staring at the ceiling.
``Physics has had great success at describing certai
n kinds of behavior: planets in orbit,
spacecraft going to the moon, pendulums and springs
and rolling balls, that sort of thing. The
regular movement of objects. These are described by
what are called linear equations, and
mathematicians can solve those equations easily. We
've been doing it for hundreds of years.''
``Okay,'' Gennaro said.
``But there is another kind of behavior, which physi
cs handles badly. For example, anything to
do with turbulence. Water coming out of a spout. Ai
r moving over an airplane wing. Weather.
Blood flowing through the heart. Turbulent events a
re described by nonlinear equations. They're
bard to solve-in fact, they're usually impossible t
o solve. So physics has never understood this
whole class of events. Until about ten years ago. T
he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) new theory that describes them is called
chaos theory.
``Chaos theory originally grew out of attempts to ma
ke computer models of weather in the
1960s. Weather is a big complicated system, namely
the earth's atmosphere as it interacts with
the land and the sun. The behavior of this big comp
licated system always defied understanding.
So naturally we couldn't predict weather. But what
the early researchers learned from computer
models was that, even if you could understand it, y
ou still couldn't predict it. Weather prediction is

<p/>absolutely impossible. The reason is that the behav
ior of the system is sensitively dependent on
initial conditions.''
``You lost me,<div class="bookquote">'' Gennaro said.

t a certain speed, and a certain angle of
inclination-and if I then fire a second shell with
almost the same weight, speed, and angle-what

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The two shells will land at almost the same spot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said. <div class="bookquote">``That's linear dynamics.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But if I have a weather system that I start up wit
h a certain temperature and a certain wind

t with almost the same temperature, wind, and

he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) same. It'll wander off and rapidly will
become very different from the first. Thunderstorms
instead of sunshine. That's nonlinear
dynamics. They are sensitive to initial conditions:
tiny differences become amplified.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``The shorthand is the `butterfly effect.' A butterf

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So chaos is all just random and unpredictable?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Ge
nnaro said. <div class="bookquote">``Is that it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said. <div class="bookquote">``We actually find bidden regula
rities within the complex variety of a
system's behavior. That's why chaos has now become
a very broad theory that's used to study
everything from the stock market, to rioting crowds

complex system where there is confusion and unpredi
ctability. We can find an underlying order.
Okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``But what is this underlying

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said. <div class="bookquote">``I'll get there. Chao
s theory says two things. First, that complex
systems like weather have an underlying order. Seco
nd, the reverse of that-that simple systems
can produce complex behavior. For example, pool bal
ls. You hit a pool ball, and it starts to carom
off the sides of the table. In theory, that's a fai
rly simple system, almost a Newtonian system.
Since you can know the force imparted to the ball,
and the mass of the ball, and you can
calculate the angles at which it will strike the wa
lls, you can predict the future behavior of the bal
l.
In theory, you could predict the behavior of the ba
ll far into the future, as it keeps bouncing from
side to side. You could predict where it will end u
p three hours from now, in theory.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro nodded.
But in fact,'' Malcolm said, ``it turns out you can't
predict more than a few seconds into the
future. Because almost immediately very small effec
ts-imperfections in the surface of the ball, tiny
indentations in the wood of the table-start to make
a difference. And it doesn't take long before
they overpower your careful calculations. So it tur
ns out that this simple system of a pool ball on a
table has unpredictable behavior.<div class="bookquote">''
''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Okay.''
``And Hammond's project,'' Malcolm said, ``is another
apparently simple system-animals within
a zoo environment-that will eventually show unpredi
ctable behavior.''
<div class="bookquote">``You know this because of ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Theory,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said.
<div class="bookquote">``But hadn't you better see the island, to see what

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``No. That is quite unnecessary. The details don't m
atter. Theory tells me that the island will

 (<font color='red'><b>San</b></font>)</div>Isla Nublar
With a whine, the rotors began to swing in circles
overhead, casting shadows on the runway of
San Jos airport. Grant listened to the crackle in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) earphones as the pilot talked to the tower.
They had picked up another passenger in San Jos, a
man named Dennis Nedry, who had
flown In to meet them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) was fat and sloppy, eatin
g a candy bar, and there was sticky chocolate
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) fingers, and flecks of aluminum foil on his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)
shirt. Nedry had mumbled something about
doing computers on the island, and hadn't offered t
o shake hands.
Through the Plexi bubble Grant watched the airport
concrete drop away beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) feet, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw the shadow of the helicopter racing along as
they went west, toward the mountains.
<div class="bookquote">``It's about a forty-minute trip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said, fro
m one of the rear seats.
Grant watched the low hills rise up, and then they
were passing through intermittent clouds,
breaking out into sunshine. The mountains were rugg
ed, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was surprised at the amount
of deforestation, acre after acre of denuded, erode
d hills. <div class="bookquote">``Costa Rica,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said, <div class="bookquote">``has

deforested. Most of this is within the last ten yea

 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>They came down out of the clouds on the other side
of the mountains, and Grant saw the
beaches of the west coast. They flashed over a smal
l coastal village.
<div class="bookquote">``Baha Anasco,''  (<font color='red'><b>the pilot</b></font>)</div>the pilot said. <div class="bookquote">``Fishing village.''

about ten in the morning.
<div class="bookquote">``Just a few minutes now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said, <div class="bookquote">``and we sho

 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Isla Nublar, Hammond explained, was not a true isla
nd. Rather, it was a seamount, a volcanic
upthrusting of rock from the ocean floor. <div class="bookquote">``Its volc
anic origins can be seen all over the island,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said. <div class="bookquote">``There are steam vents in many places
, and the ground is often hot underfoot.
Because of this, and also because of prevailing cur
rents, Isla Nublar lies in a foggy area. As we
get there you will see-ah, there we are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The helicopter rushed forward, low to the water. Ah
ead Grant saw an island, rugged and
craggy, rising sharply from the ocean.
<div class="bookquote">``Christ, it looks like Alcatraz,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said.
Its forested slopes were wreathed in fog, giving th
e island a mysterious appearance.
<div class="bookquote">``Much larger, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said. <div class="bookquote">``Eight mile
s long and three miles wide at the widest
point, in total some twenty-two square Miles. Makin
g it the largest private animal preserve in
North America.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The helicopter began to climb, and headed toward th
e north end of the island. Grant was trying
to see through the dense fog.
<div class="bookquote">``It's not usually this thick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) sou
nded worried.
At the north end of the island, the hills were high
est, rising more than two thousand feet above
the ocean. The tops of the hills were in fog, but G
rant saw rugged cliffs and crashing ocean
below. The helicopter climbed above the hills, <div class="bookquote">``Unf
ortunately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said, <div class="bookquote">``we have to land
on the island. I don't like to do it, because it di

''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond's voice cut off as the pilot said, <div class="bookquote">``Startin
g our descent now. Hang on, folks.''  (<font color='red'><b>the pilot</b></font>)</div>The
helicopter started down, and immediately they were
blanketed in fog. Grant heard a repetitive
electronic beeping through his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) earphones, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) co
uld see nothing at all; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) began dimly to
discern the green branches of pine trees, reaching
through the mist. Some of the branches were
close.
<div class="bookquote">``How the hell is he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) doing this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said, but
nobody answered.
The pilot swung his (<font color='blue'><b>pilot</b></font>) gaze left, then right, looking
at the pine forest. The trees were still close.
The helicopter descended rapidly.
<div class="bookquote">``Jesus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said.
The beeping was louder. Grant looked at the pilot.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was concentrating. Grant glanced down
and saw a giant glowing fluorescent cross beneath t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) Plexi bubble at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) feet. There were
flashing lights at the corners of the cross. The pi
lot corrected slightly and touched down on a
helipad. The sound of the rotors faded, and died.
Grant sighed, and released his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) seat belt.
<div class="bookquote">``We have to come down fast, that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said
, <div class="bookquote">``because of the wind shear. There is
often had wind shear on this peak, and ... well,
we're safe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Someone was running up to the helicopter. A man wit
h a baseball cap and red hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) threw
open the door and said cheerfully, <div class="bookquote">``Hi, I'm Ed Regi
s. Welcome to Isla Nublar, everybody. And
watch your step, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>A narrow path wound down the hill. The air was chil
ly and damp. As they moved lower, the mist
around them thinned, and Grant could see the landsc
ape better. It looked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) thought, rather like
the Pacific Northwest, the Olympic Peninsula.
<div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Regis said. <div class="bookquote">``Primary ecology is dec
iduous rain forest. Rather different from the
vegetation on the mainland, which is more classical
rain forest. But this is a microclimate that only
occurs at elevation, on the slopes of the northern
hills. The majority of the island is tropical.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Down below, they could see the white roofs of large
buildings, nestled among the planting.
Grant was surprised: the construction was elaborate
. They moved lower, out of the mist, and now
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could see the full extent of the island, stretch
ing away to the south. As Regis had said, it was
mostly covered in tropical forest.
To the south, rising above the palm trees, Grant sa
w a single trunk with no leaves at all, just a
big curving stump. Then the stump moved, and twiste
d around to face the new arrivals. Grant
realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was not seeing a tree at all.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was looking at the graceful, curving neck of an
enormous creature, rising fifty feet into the
air.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was looking at a dinosaur.
Welcome
<div class="bookquote">``My God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said softly. They were all staring
at the animal above the trees. <div class="bookquote">``My God.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) first thought was that the dinosaur was extraor
dinarily beautiful. Books portrayed them as
oversize, dumpy creatures, but this long-necked ani
mal had a gracefulness, almost a dignity,
about its movements. And it was quick-there was not
hing lumbering or dull in its behavior. The
sauropod peered alertly at them, and made a low tru
mpeting sound, rather like an elephant. A
moment later, a second head rose above the foliage,
and then a third, and a fourth.
<div class="bookquote">``My God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said again.
Gennaro was speechless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) had known all along what
to expect-he had known about it for
years-but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) had somehow never believed it would ha
ppen, and now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) was shocked into
silence. The awesome power of the new genetic techn
ology, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) had formerly considered to
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) just so many words in an overwrought sales pitch
-the power suddenly became clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>).
These animals were so big! They were enormous! Big
as a house! And so many of them! Actual
damned dinosaurs! Just as real as you could want.
Gennaro thought: We are going to make a fortune on
this place. A fortune. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
hoped to God the island was safe.
Grant stood on the path on the side of the hill, wi
th the mist on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) face, staring at the gray necks
craning above the palms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) felt dizzy, as if the g
round were sloping away too steeply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had
trouble getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) breath. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was looking
at something he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had never expected to see in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) life. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was seeing it.
The animals in the mist were perfect apatosaurs, me
dium-size sauropods. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) stunned mind
made academic associations: North American herbivor
es, late Jurassic horizon. Commonly
called <div class="bookquote">``brontosaurs.''  (<font color='red'><b>E. D. Cop</b></font>)</div>First discovered by E. D. Cop
e in Montana in 1876. Specimens associated
with Morrison formation strata in Colorado, Utah, a
nd Oklahoma. Recently Berman and McIntosh
had reclassified it a diplodocus based on skull app
earance, Traditionally, Brontosaurus was
thought to spend most of its time in shallow water,
which would help support its large bulk.
Although this animal was clearly not in the water,
it was moving much too quickly, the head and
neck shifting above the palms in a very active mann
er-a surprisingly active manner-
Grant began to laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said, worried. <div class="bookquote">``Is something
wrong?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant just shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head, and continued to laugh.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) couldn't tell them that what was funny
was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had seen the animal for only a few seco
nds, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had already begun to accept it-
and to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) observations to answer long-standing
questions in the field.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was still laughing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw a fifth and a sixth
neck crane up above the palm trees. The
sauropods watched the people arrive. They reminded
Grant of oversize giraffes-they had the
same pleasant, rather stupid gaze.
<div class="bookquote">``I take it they're not animatronic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said.
<div class="bookquote">``They're very lifelike.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they certainly are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said. <div class="bookquote">``Well, the
y should be, shouldn't they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>From the distance, they heard the trumpeting sound
again. First one animal made it, and then
the others joined in.
<div class="bookquote">``That's their call,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed Regis said. <div class="bookquote">``Welcoming us t
o the island.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant stood and listened for a moment, entranced.
<div class="bookquote">``You probably want to know what happens next,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hamm</b></font>)</div>Hamm
ond was saying, continuing down the
path. ``We've scheduled a complete tour of the facil

the park later this afternoon. I'll be joining you
for dinner, and will answer any remaining questions

<p/>you may have then. Now, if you'll go with Mr. Regis

The group followed Ed Regis toward the nearest buil
dings. Over the path, a crude band-
painted sign read: <div class="bookquote">``Welcome to Jurassic Park.''

They moved into a green tunnel of overarching palms
leading toward the main visitor building.
Everywhere, extensive and elaborate planting emphas
ized the feeling that they were entering a
new world, a prehistoric tropical world, and leavin
g the normal world behind.
Ellie said to Grant, <div class="bookquote">``They look pretty good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``I want to see them up close. I

Grant shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It changes everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) s

For 150 years, ever since the discovery of gigantic
animal bones in Europe, the study of
dinosaurs had been an exercise in scientific deduct
ion. Paleontology was essentially detective
work, searching for clues in the fossil bones and t
he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) trackways of the long-vanished giants. The
best paleontologists were the ones who could make t
he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) most clever deductions.
And all the great disputes of paleontology were car
ried out in this fashion-including the bitter
debate, in which Grant was a key figure, about whet
her (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) dinosaurs were warm-blooded.
Scientists had always classified dinosaurs as repti
les, cold-blooded creatures drawing the heat
they needed for life from the environment. A mammal
could metabolize food to produce bodily
warmth, but a reptile could not. Eventually a handf
ul of researchers-led chiefly by John Ostrom
and Robert Bakker at Yale-began to suspect that the
concept of sluggish, cold-blooded dinosaurs
was inadequate to explain the fossil record. In cla
ssic deductive fashion, they drew conclusions
from several lines of evidence.
First was posture: lizards and reptiles were bent-l
egged sprawlers, hugging the ground for
warmth. Lizards didn't have the energy to stand on
their hind legs for more than a few seconds.
But the dinosaurs stood on straight legs, and many
walked erect on their hind legs. Among living
animals, erect posture occurred only in warm-bloode
d mammals and birds. Thus dinosaur
posture suggested warm-bloodedness.
Next they studied metabolism, calculating the press
ure necessary to push blood up the
eigbteen-foot-long neck of a brachlosaur, and concl
uding that it could only be accomplished by a
four-chambered, hot-blooded heart.
They studied trackways, fossil footprints left in m
ud, and concluded that dinosaurs ran as fast
as a man; such activity implied warm blood. They fo
und dinosaur remains above the Arctic Circle,
in a frigid environment unimaginable for a reptile.
And the new studies of group behavior, based
largely on Grant's own work, suggested that dinosau
rs had a complex social life and reared their
young, as reptiles did not. Crocodiles and turtles
abandon their eggs. But dinosaurs probably did
not.
The warm-blooded controversy had raged for fifteen
years, before a new perception of
dinosaurs as quick-moving, active animals was acecp
ted-but not without lasting animosities. At
conventions, there were still colleagues who did no
t speak to one another.
But now, if dinosaurs could be cloned-why, Grant's
field of study was going to change instantly.
The paleontological study of dinosaurs was finished
. The whole enterprise-the museum balls with
their giant skeletons and flocks of echoing schoolc
hildren, the university laboratories with their
bone trays, the research papers, the journals-all o
f it was going to end.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't seem upset,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said.
Grant shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It's been discussed, in the
field. Many people imagined it was coming.
But not so soon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Story of our species,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Ev
erybody knows it's coming, but not so soon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>As they walked down the path, they could no longer
see the dinosaurs, but they could hear
them, trumpeting softly in the distance.
Grant said, <div class="bookquote">``My only question is, where'd they get
the DNA?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant was aware of serious speculation in laborator
ies in Berkeley, Tokyo, and London that it
might eventually be possible to clone an extinct an
imal such as a dinosaur-if you could get some
dinosaur DNA to work with. The problem was that all
known dinosaurs were fossils, and the
fossilization destroyed most DNA, replacing it with
inorganic material. Of course, if a dinosaur
was frozen, or preserved in a peat bog, or mummifie
d in a desert environment, then its DNA
might be recoverable.
But nobody had ever found a frozen or mummified din
osaur. So cloning was therefore
impossible. There was nothing to clone from. All th
e modern genetic technology was useless, It
was like having a Xerox copier but nothing to copy
with it.
Ellie said, <div class="bookquote">``You can't reproduce a real dinosaur, b
ecause you can't get real dinosaur DNA.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Unless there's a way we haven't thought of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant
said. <div class="bookquote">``Like what?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
Beyond a fence, they came to the swimming pool, whi
ch spilled over into a series of waterfalls
and smaller rocky pools. The area was planted with
huge ferns. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't this extraordinary?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed
Regis said. <div class="bookquote">``Especially on a misty day, these plant
s really contribute to the prehistoric
atmosphere. These are authentic Jurassic ferns, of
course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie paused to look more closely at the ferns. Yes
, it was just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) said: Serenna veriformans, a
plant found abundantly in fossils more than two hun
dred million years old, now common only in
the wetlands of Brazil and Colombia. But whoever ha
d decided to place this particular fern at
poolside obviously didn't know that the spores of v
eriformans contained a deadly beta-carboline
alkaloid. Even touching the attractive green fronds
could make you sick, and if a child were to
take a mouthful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) would almost certainly die-the
toxin was fifty times more poisonous than
oleander.
People were so naive about plants, Ellie thought. T
hey just chose plants for appearance, as
they would choose a picture for the wall. It never
occurred to them that plants were actually living
things, busily performing all the living functions
of respiration, ingestion, excretion, reproduction-
and defense.
But Ellie knew that, in the earth's history, plants
had evolved as competitively as animals, and
in some ways more fiercely. The poison in Serenna v
eriformans was a minor example of the
elaborate chemical arsenal of weapons that plants h
ad evolved. There were terpenes, which
plants spread to poison the soil around them and in
hibit competitors; alkaloids, which made them
unpalatable to insects and predators -LRB-and children-RRB-
; and pheromones, used for communication.
When a Douglas fir tree was attacked by beetles, it
produced an anti-feedant chemical-and so did
other Douglas firs in distant parts of the forest.
It happened in response to a warning
alleochemical secreted by the trees that were under
attack.
People who imagined that life on earth consisted of
animals moving against a green
background seriously misunderstood what they were s
eeing. That green background was busily
alive. Plants grew, moved, twisted, and turned, fig
hting for the sun; and they interacted
continuously with ammals-discouraging some with bar
k and thorns; poisoning others, and feeding
still others to advance their own reproduction, to
spread their pollen and seeds. It was a complex,
dynamic process which she (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) never ceased to find fasc
inating. And which she (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) knew most people
simply didn't understand.
But if planting deadly ferns at poolside was any in
dication, then it was clear that the designers of
Jurassic Park had not been as careful as they shoul
d have been.
<div class="bookquote">``Isn't it just wonderful?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed Regis was saying. <div class="bookquote">``If
you look up ahead, you'll see our Safari
Lodge.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie saw a dramatic, low building, with a
series of glass pyramids on the roof. <div class="bookquote">``That's
where you'll all be staying here in Jurassic Park.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div><p/>Grant's suite was done in beige tones, the rattan f
urniture in green jungle-print motifs. The room
wasn't quite finished; there were stacks of lumber
in the closet, and pieces of electrical conduit on
the floor. There was a television set in the corner
, with a card on top:
Channel 2: Hypsilophodont Highlands
Channel 3: Triceratops Territory
Channel 4: Sauropod Swamp

<p/>Channel 5: Carnivore Country

<p/>Channel 6: Stegosaurus South

<p/>Channel 7: Velociraptor Valley
Channel 8: Pterosaur Peak
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) found the names irritatingly cute. Grant turned
on the television but got only static. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) shut
it off and went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) bedroom, tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) suitca
se on the bed. Directly over the bed was a large
pyramidal skylight. It created a tented feeling, li
ke sleeping under the stars. Unfortunately the
glass had to be protected by heavy bars, so that st
riped shadows fell across the bed.
Grant paused. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had seen the plans for the lodge,
and be didn't remember bars on the
skylight. In fact, these bars appeared to be a rath
er crude addition. A black steel frame had been
constructed outside the glass walls, and the bars w
elded to the frame.
Puzzled, Grant moved from the bedroom to the living
room. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) window looked out on the
swimming pool.
<div class="bookquote">``By the way, those ferns are poison,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said, w
alking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) room. <div class="bookquote">``But did you notice
anything about the rooms, Alan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They changed the plans.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think so, yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) moved around the room. <div class="bookquote">``The
windows are small,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And the
glass is tempered, set in a steel frame. The doors
are steel-clad. That shouldn't be necessary.
And did you see the fence when we came in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant nodded. The entire lodge was enclosed within
a fence, with bars of incb-thick steel. The
fence was gracefully landscaped and painted flat bl
ack to resemble wrought iron, but no cosmetic
effort could disguise the thickness of the metal, o
r its twelve-foot height.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't think the fence was in the plans, either,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said. <div class="bookquote">``It looks to me like they've turned

 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``We'll be sure to ask wh

 (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div>When Dinosaurs ruled the Earth
They met in the visitor building: two stories high,
and all glass with exposed black anodized
girders and supports. Grant found it determinedly h
igh-tech.
There was a small auditorium dominated by a robot T
yrannosaurus rex, poised menacingly by
the entrance to an exhibit area labeled WHEN DINOSA
URS RULED THE EARTH. Farther on
were other displays: WHAT IS A DINOSAUR? and THE ME
SOZOIC WORLD. But the exhibits
weren't completed; there were wires and cables all
over the floor. Gennaro climbed up on the
stage and talked to Grant, Ellie, and Malcolm, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
voice echoing slightly in the room.
Hammond sat in the back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) hands folded across hi
s chest.
<div class="bookquote">``We're about to tour the facilities,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
``I'm sure Mr. Hammond and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) staff will
show everything in the best light. Before we go, I
wanted to review why we are here, and what I
need to decide before we leave. Basically, as you a
ll realize by now, this is an island in which
genetically engineered dinosaurs have been allowed
to move in a natural park-like setting,
forming a tourist attraction. The attraction isn't
open to tourists yet, but it will be in a year.
``Now, my question for you is a simple one. Is this
island safe? Is it safe for visitors, and is it
safely containing the dinosaurs?''
Gennaro turned down the room lights. ``There are two
pieces of evidence which we have to
deal with. First of all, there is Dr. Grant's ident
ification of a previously unknown dinosaur on the
Costa Rican mainland. This dinosaur is known only f
rom a partial fragment. It was found in July
of this year, after it supposedly bit an American g
irl on a beach. Dr. Grant can tell you more later.
I've asked for the original fragment, which is in a
lab in New York, to be flown here so that we can
inspect it directly. Meanwhile, there is a second p
iece of evidence.
<div class="bookquote">``Costa Rica has an excellent medical service, and i
t tracks all kinds of data. Beginning in
March, there were reports of lizards biting infants
in their cribs-and also, I might add, biting old
people who were sleeping soundly. These lizard bite
s were sporadically reported in coastal
villages from Ismaloya to Puntarenas. After March,
lizard bites were no longer reported.
However, I have this graph from the Public Health S
ervice in San Jos of infant mortality in the
towns of the west coast earlier this year.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I direct your attention to two features of this gr
aph,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``First, infant mortality is low
in
the months of January and February, then spikes in
March, then it's low again in April. But from
May onward, it is high, right through July, the mon
th the American girl was bitten. The Public
Health Service feels that something is now affectin
g infant mortality, and it is not being reported
by the workers in the coastal villages. The second
feature is the puzzling biweekly spiking, which
seems to suggest some kind of alternating phenomeno
n is at work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The lights came back on. <div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.

<div class="bookquote">``And second, the graph from the Public Health Servi

 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'll notice that the graph alternates between hi

characteristic of many complex systems. For example

 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because of what you are attempting here. Look, thi

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But from my point of view, such an undertaking is
impossible. The mathematics are so self-

rather like my asking you whether, on a billion

need to pull out your calculator to check.

be clear. Zoos take the nature that already

This park is attempting something far more ambitiou

making a space station on earth.''

I don't want to upset the children.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant turned, and saw two children coming down the
hillside, led by Ed Regis. There was a
bespectacled boy of about eleven, and a girl a few
years younger, perhaps seven or eight, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
blond hair pushed up under a Mets baseball cap, and
a baseball glove slung over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulder.
The two kids made their way nimbly down the path fr
om the helipad, and stopped some distance
from Gennaro and Hammond.
Low, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) breath, Gennaro said, <div class="bookquote">``Christ.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now, take it easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said. <div class="bookquote">``Their parents a

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>The girl waved tentatively.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi, Grandpa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We're here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>The Tour
Tim Murphy could see at once that something was wro
ng. His (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) grandfather was in the middle of
an argument with the younger, red-faced man opposit
e him (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>). And the other adults, standing
behind, looked embarrassed and uncomfortable. Alexi
s felt the tension, too, because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hung
back, tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) baseball in the air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) had to pu
sh her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Go on, Lex.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go on yourself, Timmy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't be a worm,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) said.
Lex glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>), but Ed Regis said cheerfully, <div class="bookquote">``I
'll introduce you to everybody, and then we
can take the tour.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll just introduce you first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed Regis said.
<div class="bookquote">``No, I have to go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>But Ed Regis was already making introductions. Firs
t to Grandpa, who kissed them both, and
then to the man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was arguing with. This man was m
uscular and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name was Gennaro. The
rest of the introductions Were a blur to Tim. There
was a blond woman wearing shorts, and a
man with a beard who wore jeans and a Hawaiian shir
t. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked like the outdoors type. Then a
fat college kid who had something to do with comput
ers, and finally a thin man in black, who
didn't shake hands, but just nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. Tim w
as trying to organize his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) impressions, and
was looking at the blond woman's legs, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sudd
enly realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew who the
bearded man was.
<div class="bookquote">``Your mouth is open,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
Tim said, <div class="bookquote">``I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Timmy</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh sure. You just met him (<font color='blue'><b>Timmy</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said. <div class="bookquote">``I have his (<font color='blue'><b>Timmy</b></font>) book.''

st
World of the Dinosaurs, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
Alexis snickered. <div class="bookquote">``Daddy says Tim has dinosaurs on
the brain,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexis</b></font>) said.
Tim hardly heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexis</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was thinking of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) kn
ew about Alan Grant. Alan Grant was one
of the principal advocates of the theory that dinos
aurs were warm-blooded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had done lots of
digging at the place called Egg Hill in Montana, wh
ich was famous because so many dinosaur
eggs had been found there. Professor Grant had foun
d most of the dinosaur eggs that had ever
been discovered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was also a good illustrator, an
d he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) drew the pictures for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) own books.
<div class="bookquote">``Dinosaurs on the brain?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the bearded man said. <div class="bookquote">``We
ll, as a matter of fact, I have that same
problem.''

He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) says Tim should get out in the air and
play more sports,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Tim felt embarrassed. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you had to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``In a
minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``I thought you were in such a rush.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm the one who would know, don't you think, Timot
hy?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
hips, copying her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) mother's most irritating stance.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed Regis said. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't we all j
ust head on over to the visitor center and we
can begin our tour.''  (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div>Everybody started walking. Tim
heard Gennaro whisper to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) grandfather, <div class="bookquote">``I
could kill you for this,''  (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>and then Tim looked up an
d saw that Dr Grant had fallen into step beside
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``How old are you, Tim?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Eleven.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And how long have you been interested in dinosaurs
?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant asked.
Tim swallowed. <div class="bookquote">``A while now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) felt nerv
ous to be talking to Dr. Grant. <div class="bookquote">``We go to
museums sometimes, when I can talk my family into i
t. My father.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your father's not especially interested?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim nodded, and told Grant about his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) family's last
trip to the Museum of Natural History. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
father had looked at a skeleton and said, <div class="bookquote">``That's a
big one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>Tim had said, <div class="bookquote">``No, Dad, that's a medium-size one, a
camptosaurus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know. Looks pretty big to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's not even full-grown, Dad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) father squinted at the skeleton. <div class="bookquote">``What is it, J
urassic?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jeez. No. Cretaceous.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cretaceous? What's the difference between Cretaceo
us and Jurassic?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only about a hundred million years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
<div class="bookquote">``Cretaceous is older?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Dad, Jurassic is older.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) father said, stepping back, <div class="bookquote">``it looks p
retty damn big to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) turned to Tim for
agreement. Tim knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) had better agree with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) fa
ther, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) just muttered something. And
they went on to another exhibit-
Tim stood in front of one skeleton-Tyrannosaurus re
x, the mightiest predator the earth had
ever known-for a long time. Finally his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) father said
, <div class="bookquote">``What are you looking at?''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm counting the vertebrae,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
<div class="bookquote">``The vertebrae?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In the backbone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I know what vertebrae are,'' his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) father said, annoye
d. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) stood there a while longer and then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said, ``Why are you counting them?''
``I think they're wrong. Tyrannosaurs should only ha
ve thirty-seven vertebrae in the tall. This
has more.''
``You mean to tell me,'' his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) father said, ``that the M
useum of Natural History has a skeleton
that's wrong? I can't believe that.''
``It's wrong,'' Tim said.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) father stomped off toward a guard in the corner
. ``What did you do now?'' his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) mother said to
Tim.
``I didn't do anything,'' Tim said. ``I just said the
dinosaur is wrong, that's all.''
And then his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) father came back with a funny look on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) face, because of course the guard told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) that the tyrannosaurus had too many vertebrae i
n the tail.
``How'd you know that?'' his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) father asked. ``I read

<p/>it,'' Tim said.
``That's pretty amazing, son,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) put h
is hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) shoulder, giving it a squeeze.
``You know how many vertebrae belong in that tail. I
've never seen anything like it. You really do
have dinosaurs on the brain.''
And then his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) father said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wanted to catch the las
t half of the Mets game on TV, and Lex said
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did, too, so they left the museum. And Tim didn
't see any other dinosaurs, which was why
they had come there in the first place. But that wa
s how things happened in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) family.
How things used to happen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) family, Tim correc
ted himself. Now that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) father was getting a
divorce from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother, things would probably be d
ifferent. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father had already moved out,
and even though it was weird at first, Tim liked it
. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) mother had a boyfriend, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
couldn't be sure, and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) would never ment
ion it to Lex. Lex was heartbroken to be
separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father, and in the last few week
s she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had become so obnoxious that-
``Was it 5027?'' Grant said. ``I'm

<p/>sorry?'' Tim said.
``The tyrannosaurus at the museum. Was it 5027?''
``Yes,'' Tim said. ``How'd you know?''
Grant smiled. ``They've been talking about fixing it
for years. But now it may never happen.''
``Why is that?''
``Because of what is taking place here,'' Grant said,
``on your grandfather's island.''
Tim shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) didn't understand what Grant
was talking about. <div class="bookquote">``My mom said it was
just a resort, you know, with swimming and tennis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``I'll explain as we walk
along.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Now I'm a damned babysitter, Ed Regis thought unhap
pily, tapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) foot as he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) waited in the
visitor center. That was what the old man had told
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): You watch my kids like a hawk,
they're your responsibility for the weekend.
Ed Regis didn't like it at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) felt degraded. H
e wasn't a damn babysitter. And, for that
matter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) wasn't a damned tour guide, even for VIP
s. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) was the head of public relations for
Jurassic Park, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) had much to prepare between n
ow and the opening, a year away. Just to
coordinate with the PR firms in San Francisco and L
ondon, and the agencies in New York and
Tokyo, was a full-time job-especially since the age
ncies couldn't yet be told what the resort's real
attraction was. The firms were all designing teaser
campaigns, nothing specific, and they were
unhappy. Creative people needed nurturing. They nee
ded encouragement to do their best work.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) couldn't waste his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) time taking scientists on tou
rs.
But that was the trouble with a career in public re
lations-nobody saw you as a professional.
Regis had been down here on the island off and on f
or the past seven months, and they were still
pushing odd jobs on him (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>). Like that episode back in
January. Harding should have handled that.
Harding, or Owens, the general contractor. Instead,
it had fallen to Ed Regis. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) know
about taking care of some sick workman? And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>)
was a damn tour guide and babysitter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>)
turned back and counted the heads. Still one short.

<p/>Then, in the back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) saw Dr. Sattler emerge from t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) bathroom. <div class="bookquote">``All right, folks, let's begin our
tour on the second floor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim went with the others, following Mr. Regis up th
e black suspended staircase to the second
floor of the building. They passed a sign that read
:
CLOSED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY
BEYOND THIS POINT
Tim felt a thrill when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw that sign. They walke
d down the secondfloor hallway. One wall
was glass, looking out onto a balcony with palm tre
es in the light mist. On the other wall were
stenciled doors, like offices: PARK WARDEN ... GUES
T SERVICES ... GENERAL MANAGER. .
. .
Halfway down the corridor they came to a glass part
ition marked with another sign:

<p/>Underneath were more signs:
CAUTION
Teratogenic Substances
Pregnant Women Avoid Exposure
To This Area
DANGER
Radioactive Isotopes In Use
Carcinogenic Potential
Tim grew more excited all the time. Teratogenic sub
stances! Things that made monsters! It
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) a thrill, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was disappointed to hear
Ed Regis say, <div class="bookquote">``Never mind the signs, they're
just up for legal reasons. I can assure you everyth
ing is perfectly safe.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) led them through the
door. There was a guard on the other side. Ed Regis
turned to the group.
<div class="bookquote">``You may have noticed that we have a minimum of per
sonnel on the island. We can run this
resort with a total of twenty people. Of course, we
'll have more when we have guests here, but at
the moment there's only twenty. Here's our control
room. The entire park is controlled from here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They paused before windows and peered into a darken
ed room that looked like a small version
of Mission Control. There was a vertical glass see-
through map of the park, and facing it a bank
of glowing computer consoles- Some of the screens d
isplayed data, but most of them showed
video images from around the park. There were just
two people inside, standing and talking.
<div class="bookquote">``The man on the left is our chief engineer, John Ar
nold'' (<font color='red'><b>Regis</b></font>)</div>-Regis pointed to a thin man in a
button-down short-sleeve shirt and tie, smoking a c
igarette-<div class="bookquote">``and next to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), our park warden,
Mr. Robert Muldoon, the famous white bunter from Na
irobi.''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>Muldoon was a burly man in khaki,
sunglasses dangling from his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) shirt pockct. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) glanc
ed out at the group, gave a brief nod, and
turned back to the computer screens. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you
want to see this room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed Regis said, <div class="bookquote">``but
first, let's see how we obtain dinosaur DNA.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>The sign on the door said EXTRACTIONS and, like all
the doors in the laboratory building, it
opened with a security card. Ed Regis slipped the c
ard in the slot; the light blinked; and the door
opened.
Inside, Tim saw a small room bathed in green light.
Four technicians in lab coats were peering
into double-barreled stereo microscopes, or looking
at images on high resolution video screens.
The room was filled with yellow stones. The stones
were in glass shelves; in cardboard boxes; in
large pull-out trays. Each stone was tagged and num
bered in black ink.
Regis introduced Henry Wu, a slender man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) thi
rties. <div class="bookquote">``Dr. Wu is our chief geneticist. I'll let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) explain what we do here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Henry Wu smiled. <div class="bookquote">``At least I'll try,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Gen
etics is a bit complicated. But you're probably
wondering where our dinosaur DNA comes from.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It crossed my mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
<div class="bookquote">``As a matter of fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said, <div class="bookquote">``there are two poss
ible sources. Using the Loy antibody
extraction technique, we can sometimes get DNA dire
ctly from dinosaur bones.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What kind of a yield?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, most soluble protein is leached out during f
ossilization, but twenty percent of the
proteins are still recoverable by grinding up the b
ones and using Loy's procedure. Dr. Loy himself
has used it to obtain proteins from extinct Austral
ian marsupials, as well as blood cells from
ancient human remains. His (<font color='blue'><b>Loy</b></font>) technique is so refined
it can work with a mere fifty nanograms of
material. That's fifty-billionths of a gram.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you've adapted his (<font color='blue'><b>Loy</b></font>) technique here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant aske
d.
<div class="bookquote">``Only as a backup,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Wu said. <div class="bookquote">``As you can imagine, a
twenty percent yield is insufficient for our
work. We need the entire dinosaur DNA strand in ord
er to clone. And we get it here.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) held up
one of the yellow stones. <div class="bookquote">``From amber-the fossilize
d resin of prehistoric tree sap.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant looked at Ellie, then at Malcolm.
<div class="bookquote">``That's really quite clever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said, nodding
. <div class="bookquote">``I still
don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant admitted.
<div class="bookquote">``Tree sap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu explained, <div class="bookquote">``often flows over insects
and traps them. The insects are then
perfectly preserved within the fossil. One finds al
l kinds of insects in amber-including biting
insects that have sucked blood from larger animals.
''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sucked the blood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant repeated. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) mouth fell
open. ``You mean sucked the blood of
dinosaurs.
``Hopefully, yes.''
``And then the insects are preserved in amber...
'' Grant shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head. ``I'll be damned-that
just might work.''
``I assure you, it does work,'' Wu said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) moved to
one of the microscopes, where a technician
positioned a piece of amber containing a fly under
the microscope. On the video monitor, they
watched as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) inserted a long needle through the am
ber, into the thorax of the prehistoric fly.
``If this insect has any foreign blood cells, we may
be able to extract them, and obtain paleo-
DNA, the DNA of an extinct creature. We won't know
for sure, of course, until we extract
whatever is in there, replicate it, and test it. Th
at is what we have been doing for five years now. I
t
has been a long, slow process-but it has paid off.
<div class="bookquote">``Actually, dinosaur DNA is somewhat easier to extra
ct by this process than mammalian DNA.
The reason is that mammalian red cells have no nucl
ei, and thus no DNA in their red cells. To
clone a mammal, you must find a white cell, which i
s much rarer than red cells. But dinosaurs
had nucleated red cells, as do modern birds. It is
one of the many indications we have that
dinosaurs aren't really reptiles at all. They are b
ig leathery birds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim saw that Dr. Grant still looked skeptical, and
Dennis Nedry, the messy fat man, appeared
completely uninterested, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) knew it all alrea
dy. Nedry kept looking impatiently toward the
next room.
<div class="bookquote">``I see Mr. Nedry has spotted the next phase of our
work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said. <div class="bookquote">``How we identify the DNA
we have extracted. For that, we use powerful comput
ers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They went through sliding doors into a chilled room
. There was a loud humming sound. Two
six-foot-tall round towers stood in the center of t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) room, and along the walls were rows of waist-
high stainless-steel boxes. <div class="bookquote">``This is our high-tech
laundromat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Wu</b></font>)</div>Dr. Wu said. <div class="bookquote">``The boxes along the
walls are all Hamachi-Hood automated gene sequencer
s. They are being run, at very high speed,
by the Cray XMP supercomputers, which are the tower
s in the center of the room. In essence,
you are standing in the middle of an incredibly pow
erful genetics factory.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There were several monitors, all running so fast it
was hard to see what they were showing.
Wu pushed a button and slowed one image.

 (<font color='red'><b>CAAA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then are you working with the entire DNA strand?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said. <div class="bookquote">``That's impossible. We've come a

. We look only at the sections of the strand
that differ from animal to animal, or from contempo
rary DNA. Only a few percent of the
nucleotides differ from one species to the next. Th
at's what we analyze, and it's still a big job.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nedry/Dennis Nedry/Dennis</b></font>)</div>Dennis Nedry yawned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)'d long ago concluded that I
nGen must be doing something like this. A
couple of years earlier, when InGen had hired Nedry
to design the park control systems, one of
the initial design parameters called for data recor
ds with 3 X 109 fields. Nedry just assumed that
was a mistake, and had called Palo Alto to verify i
t. But they had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) the Spec was correct.
Three billion fields.
Nedry had worked on a lot of large systems. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)'d ma
de a name for himself setting up
worldwide telephone communications for multinationa
l corporations. Often those systems had
millions of records. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) was used to that. But InGen
wanted something so much larger... .
Puzzled, Nedry had gone to see Barney Fellows over
at Symbolics, near the M.I.T. campus in
Cambridge. <div class="bookquote">``What kind of a database has three billi
on records, Barney?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>Barney said, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``They put in an
extra zero or two.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's not a mistake. I checked. It's what they want
.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But that's crazy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>Barney said. <div class="bookquote">``It's not workable
. Even if you had the fastest processors and
blindingly fast algorithms, a search would still ta
ke days. Maybe weeks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nedry/Dennis Nedry/Dennis</b></font>)</div>Nedry said. <div class="bookquote">``I know. Fortunately I'm not be
ing asked to do algorithms. I'm just being
asked to reserve storage and memory for the overall
system. But still ... what could the
database be for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>Barney frowned. <div class="bookquote">``You operating under an ND?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nedry/Dennis Nedry/Dennis</b></font>)</div>Nedry said. Most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) jobs required nondis
closure agreements.
<div class="bookquote">``Can you tell me anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``It's a

<p/>bioengineering firm.''
``Bioengineering,'' Barney said. ``Well, there's the o
bvious...''
``Which is?''
``A DNA molecule.''
``Oh, come on,'' Nedry said. ``Nobody could be analyzi
ng a DNA molecule.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) knew biologists
were talking about the Human Genome Project, to ana
lyze a complete human DNA strand. But
that would take ten years of coordinated effort, in
volving laboratories around the world. It was an
enormous undertaking, as big as the Manhattan Proje
ct, which made the atomic bomb. ``This is a
private company,'' Nedry said.
``With three billion records,'' Barney said. ``I don't
know what else it could be. Maybe they're
being optimistic designing their system.''
``Very optimistic,'' Nedry said.
``Or maybe they're just analyzing DNA fragments, but
they've got RAM-intensive algorithms.''
That made more sense. Certain database search techn
iques ate up a lot of memory.
``You know who did their algorithms?''
``No,'' Nedry said. <div class="bookquote">``This company is very secretive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my guess is they're doing something with DNA

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nedry/Dennis Nedry/Dennis</b></font>)</div>Nedry said. <div class="bookquote">``I can't.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) had gone bac
k and designed the control systems. It had
taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) programming team more than a year
, and it was especially difficult because
the company wouldn't ever tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) what the subsyst
ems were for. The instructions were simply
<div class="bookquote">``Design a module for record keeping''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``Design a m
odule for visual display.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>They gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)
design parameters, but no details about use. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) had
been working in the dark. And now that the
system was up and running, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) wasn't surprised to l
earn there were bugs. What did they expect?
And they'd ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) down here in a panic, all ho
t and bothered about <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>ho</b></font>)</div>bugs. It was
annoying, Nedry thought.
Nedry turned back to the group as Grant asked, <div class="bookquote">``And

feet or any other physical attribute. So we can
take an unknown piece of DNA and determine roughly,
by computer, where it fits in the
evolutionary sequence. It's time-consuming, but it
can be done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the other way?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``Just grow it and find out what it is,
''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That's what we usually do. I'll
show you how that's accomplished.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim felt a growing impatience as the tour continued
. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) liked technical things, but, even so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
was losing interest. They came to the next door, wh
ich was marked FERTLIZATION, Dr. Wu
unlocked the door with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) security card, and they
went inside.
Tim saw still another room with technicians working
at microscopes. In the back was a section
entirely lit by blue ultraviolet light. Dr. Wu expl
ained that their DNA work required the interruption

<p/>of cellular mitosis at precise instants, and theref
ore they kept some of the most virulent poisons in
the world, <div class="bookquote">``Helotoxins, colchicinolds, beta-alkaloi
ds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Wu</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) said, pointing to a series of syringes set
out under the UV light. <div class="bookquote">``Kill any living animal wit
hin a second or two.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim would have liked to know more about the poisons
, but Dr. Wu droned on about using
unfertilized crocodile ova and replacing the DNA; a
nd then Professor Grant asked some
complicated questions. To one side of the room were
big tanks marked LIQUID N2. And there
were big walk-in freezers with shelves of frozen em
bryos, each stored in a tiny silver-foil wrapper.
Lex was bored. Nedry was yawning. And even Dr. Satt
ler was losing interest. Tim was tired of
looking at these complicated laboratories. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) wante
d to see the dinosaurs.
The next room was labeled HATCHERY. <div class="bookquote">``It's a little
warm and damp in here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Wu</b></font>)</div>Dr. Wu said. <div class="bookquote">``We
keep it at ninety-nine degrees Fahrenheit and a rel
ative humidity of one hundred percent. We
also run a higher O2 concentration. It's up to thir
ty-three percent.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jurassic atmosphere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes. At least we presume so. If any of you feel fa
int, just tell me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Wu</b></font>)</div>Dr. Wu inserted his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) security card into the slot, an
d the outer door hissed open. <div class="bookquote">``Just a
reminder: don't touch anything in this room. Some o
f the eggs are permeable to skin oils. And
watch your heads. The sensors are always moving.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) opened the inner door to the nursery, and they w
ent inside. Tim faced a vast open room,
bathed in deep infrared light. The eggs lay on long
tables, their pale outlines obscured by the
hissing low mist that covered the tables. The eggs
were all moving gently, rocking.
<div class="bookquote">``Reptile eggs contain large amounts of yolk but no
water at all. The embryos must extract
water from the surrounding environment. Hence the m
ist,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Wu</b></font>)</div>Dr. Wu explained that each table contained 150 eggs
, and represented a new batch of DNA
extractions. The batches were identified by numbers
at each table: STEC-458/2 or TRIC-390/4.
Waist-deep in the mist, the workers in the nursery
moved from one egg to the next, plunging their
hands into the mist, turning the eggs every hour, a
nd checking the temperatures with thermal
sensors. The room was monitored by overhead TV came
ras and motion sensors. An overhead
thermal sensor moved from one egg to the next, touc
hing each with a flexible wand, beeping,
then going on.
<div class="bookquote">``In this hatchery, we have produced more than a doz
en crops of extractions, giving us a total
of two hundred thirty-eight live animals. Our survi
val rate is somewhere around point four
percent, and we naturally want to improve that. But
by computer analysis we're working with
something like five hundred variables: one hundred
and twenty environmental, another two
hundred intra-egg, and the rest from the genetic ma
terial itself. Our eggs are plastic. The
embryos are mechanically inserted, and then hatched
here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And how long to grow?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dinosaurs mature rapidly, attaining full size in t
wo to four years. So we now have a number of
adult specimens in the park.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do the numbers mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Those codes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said, ``identify the various batch
extractions of DNA. The first four letters
identify the animals being grown. Over there, that
TRIC means Triceratops. And the STEC
means Stegosaurus, and so on.
``And this table here?'' Grant said.
The code said XXXX-0001/1. Beneath was scrawled ``Pr
esumed Coelu.''
``That's a new batch of DNA,'' Wu said. ``We don't kno
w exactly what will grow out. The first
time an extraction is done, we don't know for sure
what the animal is. You can see it's marked
`Presumed Coelu,' so it is likely to be a coelurosa
urus. A small herbivore, if I remember. It's hard
for me to keep track of the names. There are someth
ing like three hundred genera of dinosaurs
known so far.''
``Three hundred and forty-seven,'' Tim said.
Grant smiled, then said, ``Is anything hatching now?
''
``Not at the moment. The incubation period varies wi
th each animal, but in general it runs about
two months. We try to stagger hatchings, to make le
ss work for the nursery staff. You can
imagine how it is when we have a hundred and fifty
animals born within a few days-though of
course most don't survive. Actually, these X's are
due any day now. Any other questions? No?
Then we'll go to the nursery, where the newborns ar
e.''
It was a circular room, all white. There were some
incubators of the kind used in hospital
nurseries, but they were empty at the moment. Rags
and toys were scattered across the floor. A
young woman in a white coat was seated on the floor
, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back to them.
``What've you got here today, Kathy?'' Dr. Wu asked.
``Not much,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. ``Just a baby raptor.''
``Let's have a look.''
The woman got to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet and stepped aside. Tim he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
ard Nedry say, ``It looks like a lizard.''
The animal on the floor was about a foot and a half
long, the size of a small monkey. It was
dark yellow with brown stripes, like a tiger. It ha
d a lizard's head and long snout, but it stood
upright on strong hind legs, balanced by a thick st
raight tail. Its smaller front legs waved in the ai
r. It
cocked its head to one side and peered at the visit
ors staring down at it.
``Velociraptor,'' Alan Grant said, in a low voice.
``Velociraptor mongoliensis,'' Wu said, nodding. ``A p
redator. This one's only six weeks old.<div class="bookquote">''
''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I just excavated a raptor,'' Grant said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) ben
t down for a closer look. Immediately the little
lizard sprang up, leaping over Grant's head into Ti
m's arms.
``Hey!''
``They can jump,'' Wu said. ``The babies can jump. So
can the adults, as a matter of fact.''
Tim caught the velociraptor and held it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>). The
little animal didn't weigh very much, a
pound or two. The skin was warm and completely dry.
The little head was inches from Tim's face.
Its dark, beady eyes stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>). A small forked
tongue flicked in and out.
``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) hurt me?''
``No. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>)'s friendly.''
``Are you sure about that?'' asked Gennaro, with a lo
ok of concern.
``Oh, quite sure,'' Wu said. ``At least until she (<font color='blue'><b>Kathy</b></font>) grow
s a little older. But, in any case, the babies
don't have any teeth, even egg teeth.''
``Egg teeth?'' Nedry said.
``Most dinosaurs are born with egg teeth-little horn
s on the tip of the nose, like rhino horns, to
help them break out of the eggs. But raptors aren't
. They poke a hole in the eggs with their
pointed snouts, and then the nursery staff has to h
elp them out.''
``You have to help them out,'' Grant said, shaking hi
s head. ``What happens in the wild?''
``In the wild?''
``When they breed in the wild,'' Grant said. ``When th
ey make a nest.''
``Oh, they can't do that,'' Wu said. ``None of our ani
mals is capable of breeding. That's why we
have this nursery. It's the only way to replace sto
ck in Jurassic Park.''
``Why can't the animals breed?''
``Well, as you can imagine, it's important that they
not be able to breed,'' Wu said. ``And
whenever we faced a critical matter such as this, w
e designed redundant systems. That is, we
always arranged at least two control procedures. In
this case, there are two independent reasons
why the animals can't breed. First of a they're ste
rile, because we irradiate them with X-rays.''
``And the second reason?''
``All the animals in Jurassic Park are female,'' Wu s
aid, with a pleased smile.
Malcolm said, ``I should like some clarification abo
ut this. Because it seems to me that
irradiation is fraught with uncertainty. The radiat
ion dose may be wrong, or aimed at the wrong
anatomical area of the animal-''
``All true,'' Wu said. ``But we're quite confident we
have destroyed gonadal tissue.''
``And as for them all being female,<div class="bookquote">'' Malcolm said, ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is that checked? Does anyone go out and,
ah, lift up the dinosaurs' skirts to have a look? I
mean, how does one determine the sex of a
dinosaur, anyway?''
``Sex organs vary with the species. It's easy to tel
l on some, subtle on others. But, to answer
your question, the reason we know all the animals a
re female is that we literally make them that
way: we control their chromosomes, and we control t
he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) intra-egg developmental environment.
From a bioengineering standpoint, females are easie
r to breed. You probably know that all
vertebrate embryos are inherently female. We all st
art life as females. It takes some kind of
added effect-such as a hormone at the right moment
during development-to transform the
growing embryo into a male. But, left to its own de
vices, the embryo will naturally become female.
So our animals are all female. We tend to refer to
some of them as male-such as the
Tyrannosaurus rex; we all call it a `him (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>)'-but in fa
ct, they're all female. And, believe me, they can't

<p/>breed.''
The little velociraptor sniffed at Tim, and then ru
bbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head against Tim's neck. Tim giggled.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) wants you to feed her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>),'' Wu said.
``What does she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) eat?''
``Mice. But she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)'s just eaten, so we won't feed her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) a
gain for a while.''
The little raptor leaned back, stared at Tim, and w
iggled her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) forearms again in the air. Tim saw
the small claws on the three fingers of each hamd.
Then the raptor burrowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head against
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) neck again.
Grant came over, and peered critically at the creat
ure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) touched the tiny three-clawed band.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said to Tim, ``Do you mind?'' and Tim released the
raptor into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) hands.
Grant flipped the animal onto its back, inspecting
it, while the little lizard wiggled and squirmed.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) lifted the animal high to look at its profi
le, and it screamed shrilly.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) doesn't like that,'' Regis said. ``Doesn't like
to be held away from body contact...''
The raptor was still screaming, but Grant paid no a
ttention. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was squeezing the tail,
feeling the bones. Regis said, ``Dr. Grant. If you p
lease.''
``I'm not hurting her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>).''
``Dr. Grant. These creatures are not of our world. T
hey come from a time when there were no
human beings around to prod and poke them.''
``I'm not prodding and-''
``Dr. Grant. Put her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) down, '' Ed Regis said.
``But-''
``Now. '' Regis was starting to get annoyed.
Grant handed the animal back to Tim. It stopped squ
ealing. Tim could feel its little heart
beating rapidly against his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) chest.
``I'm sorry, Dr. Grant,'' Regis said. ``But these anim
als are delicate in infancy. We have lost
several from a postnatal stress syndrome, which we
believe is adrenocortically mediated.
Sometimes they die within five minutes.''
Tim petted the little raptor. ``It's okay, kid,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
said. ``Everything's fine now.'' The heart was still
beating rapidly.
``We feel it is important that the animals here be t
reated in the most humane manner,'' Regis
said. ``I promise you that you will have every oppor
tunity to examine them later.''
But Grant couldn't stay away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) again moved toward
the animal in Tim's arms, peering at it.
The little velociraptor opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) jaws and hissed
at Grant, in a posture of sudden intense
fury.
``Fascinating,'' Grant said.
``Can I stay and play with her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)?'' Tim said.
``Not right now,'' Ed Regis said, glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) wat
ch. ``It's three o'clock, and it's a good time for
a tour of the park itself, so you can see all the d
inosaurs in the habitats we have designed for
them.''
Tim released the velociraptor, which scampered acro
ss the room, grabbed a cloth rag, put it in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) mouth, and tugged at the end with her (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) tiny claw
s.
Control
Walking back toward the control room, Malcolm said,
``I have one more question, Dr. Wu. How
many different species have you made so far?''
``I'm not exactly sure,'' Wu said. ``I believe the num
ber at the moment is fifteen. Fifteen species.
Do you know, Ed?''
``Yes, it's fifteen,'' Ed Regis said, nodding.
``You don't know for sure?'' Malcolm said, affecting
astonishment.
Wu smiled. ``I stopped counting,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) said, ``after th
e first dozen. And you have to realize that
sometimes we think we have an animal correctly made
-from the standpoint of the DNA, which is
our basic work-and the animal grows for six months
and then something untoward happens. And
we realize there is some error. A releaser gene isn
't operating. A hormone not being released. Or
some other problem in the developmental sequence. S
o we have to go back to the drawing board
with that animal, so to speak.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) smiled. ``At one
time, I thought I had more than twenty species,
But now, only fifteen.''
``And is one of the fifteen species a-'' Malcolm turn
ed to Grant. ``What was the name?''
``Procompsognathus, '' Grant said.
``You have made some procompsognathuses, or whatever
they're called?'' Malcolm asked.
``Oh yes,'' Wu said immediately. ``Compys are very dis
tinctive animals. And, we made an
unusually large number of them.''
``Why is that?''
``Well, we want Jurassic Park to be as real an envir
onment as possible-as authentic as
possible-and the procompsognathids are actual scave
ngers from the Jurassic period. Rather like
jackals. So we wanted to have the compys around to
clean up.''
``You mean to dispose of carcasses?''
``Yes, if there were any. But with only two hundred
and thirty-odd animals in our total
population, we don't have many carcasses,'' Wu said.
``That wasn't the primary objective.
Actually, we wanted the compys for another kind of
waste management entirely.''
``Which was?''
``Well,'' Wu said, ``we have some very big herbivores
on this island. We have specifically tried
not to breed the biggest sauropods, but even so, we
've got several animals in excess of thirty
tons walking around out there, and many others in t
he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) five- to ten-ton area. That gives us two
problems. One is feeding them, and in fact we must
import food to the island every two weeks.
There is no way an island this small can support th
ese animals for any time.
<div class="bookquote">``But the other problem is waste. I don't know if yo
u've ever seen elephant droppings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said,
<div class="bookquote">``but they are substantial. Each spoor is roughly th
e size of a soccer ball. Imagine the droppings of
a brontosaur, ten times as large. Now imagine the d
roppings of a herd of such animals, as we
keep here. And the largest animals do not digest th
eir food terribly well, so that they excrete a
great deal. And in the sixty million years since di
nosaurs disappeared, apparently the bacteria
that specialize in breaking down their feces disapp
eared, too. At least, the sauropod feces don't
decompose readily.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's a problem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said.
<div class="bookquote">``I assure you it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said, not smiling. <div class="bookquote">``We had
a hell of a time trying to solve it. You
probably know that in Africa there is a specific in
sect, the dung beetle, which eats elephant feces.
Many other large species have associated creatures
that have evolved to eat their excrement.
Well, it turns out that compys will eat the feces o
f large herbivores and redigest it. And the
droppings of compys are readily broken down by cont
emporary bacteria. So, given enough
compys, our problem was solved.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How many compys did you make?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've forgotten exactly, but I think the target pop
ulation was fifty animals. And we attained that,
or very nearly so. In three batches. We did a batch
every six months until we had the number.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fifty animals,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said, <div class="bookquote">``is a lot to keep tr
ack of.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The control room is built to do exactly that. They
'll show you how it's done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said. ``But if one of these comp
ys were to escape from the island, to get
away .
``They can't get away.''
``I know that, but just supposing one did ...''
``You mean like the animal that was found on the bea
ch?'' Wu said, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) eyebrows. ``The
one that bit the American girl?''
``Yes, for example.''
``I don't know what the explanation for that animal
is,'' Wu said. ``But I know it can't possibly be
one of ours, for two reasons. First, the control pr
ocedures: our animals are counted by computer
every few minutes. If one were missing, we'd know a
t once.''
``And the second reason?''
``The mainland is more than a hundred miles away. It
takes almost a day to get there by boat.
And in the outside world our animals will die withi
n twelve hours,'' Wu said.
``How do you know?''
``Because I've made sure that's precisely what will
occur,'' Wu said, finally showing a trace of
irritation. ``Look, we're not fools. We understand t
hese are prehistoric animals. They are part of a
vanished ecology-a complex web of life that became
extinct millions of years ago. They might
have no predators in the contemporary world, no che
cks on their growth. We don't want them to
survive in the wild. So I've made them lysine depen
dent. I inserted a gene that makes a single
faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. As a result, t
he (<font color='blue'><b>dent</b></font>) animals cannot manufacture the amino acid
lysine. They must ingest it from the outside. Unles
s they get a rich dietary source of exogenous
lysine-supplied by us, in tablet form-they'll go in
to a coma within twelve hours and expire. These
animals are genetically engineered to be unable to
survive in the real world. They can only live
here in Jurassic Park. They are not free at all. Th
ey are essentially our prisoners.''
``Here's the control room,'' Ed Regis said. ``Now that
you know how the animals are made, you'll
want to see the control room for the park itself, b
efore we go out on the-''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) stopped. Through the thick glass window, the roo
m was dark. The monitors were off,
except for three that displayed spinning numbers an
d the image of a large boat.
``What's going on?'' Ed Regis said. ``Oh hell, they're
docking.''
``Docking?''
``Every two weeks, the supply boat comes in from the
mainland. One of the things this island
doesn't have is a good harbor, or even a good dock.
It's a little hairy to get the ship in, when the
seas are rough. Could be a few minutes.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) rapped
on the window, but the men inside paid no
attention. ``I guess we have to wait, then.''
Ellie turned to Dr. Wu. ``You mentioned before that
sometimes you make an animal and it
seems to be fine but, as it grows, it shows itself
to be flawed...''
``Yes,'' Wu said. ``I don't think there's any way arou
nd that. We can duplicate the DNA, but there
is a lot of timing in development, and we don't kno
w if everything is working unless we actually
see an animal develop correctly.''
Grant said, ``How do you know if it's developing cor
rectly? No one has ever seen these animals
before.''
Wu smiled. ``I have often thought about that. I supp
ose it is a bit of a paradox. Eventually, I
hope, paleontologists such as yourself will compare
our animals with the fossil record to verify the
developmental sequence.''
Ellie said, ``But the animal we just saw, the veloci
raptor-you said it was a mongoliensis?''
``From the location of the amber,'' Wu said. ``It it i
s from China.''
``Interesting,'' Grant said. ``I was just digging up a
n infant antirrhopus. Are there any full-grown
raptors here?''
``Yes,'' Ed Regis said without hesitation. ``Eight adu
lt females. The females are the real hunters.
They're pack hunters, you know.''
``Will we see them on the tour?''
``No,'' Wu said, looking suddenly uncomfortable. And
there was an awkward pause. Wu looked
at Regis.
``Not for a while,'' Regis said cheerfully. ``The velo
ciraptors haven't been integrated into the park
setting just yet. We keep them in a holding pen,''
``Can I see them there?'' Grant said.
``Why, yes, of course. In fact, while we're waiting''
-he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) watch-``you might want to
go around and have a look at them.''
``I certainly would,'' Grant said.
``Absolutely,'' Ellie said.
``I want to go, too,'' Tim said eagerly.
``Just go around the back of this building, past the
support facility, and you'll see the pen. But
don't get too close to the fence. Do you want to go
, too?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said to the girl.
``No,<div class="bookquote">'' Lex said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) looked appraisingly at Regis. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>You want to play a little pickle? Throw a
few?''
``Well, sure,'' Ed Regis said. ``Why don't you and I g
o downstairs and we'll do that, while we wait
for the control room to open up?''
Grant walked with Ellie and Malcolm around the back
of the main building, with the kid tagging
along. Grant liked kids-it was impossible not to li
ke any group so openly enthusiastic about
dinosaurs. Grant used to watch kids in museums as t
hey stared open-mouthed at the big
skeletons rising above them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) wondered what their
fascination really represented. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) finally
decided that children liked dinosaurs because these
giant creatures personified the
uncontrollable force of looming authority. They wer
e symbolic parents. Fascinating and
frightening, like parents. And kids loved them, as
they loved their parents.
Grant also suspected that was why even young childr
en learned the names of dinosaurs. It
never failed to amaze him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) when a three-year-old shr
ieked: ``Stegosaurus!'' Saying these
complicated names was a way of exerting power over
the giants, a way of being in control.
``What do you know about Velociraptor? '' Grant asked
Tim. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was just making conversation.
``It's a small carnivore that hunted in packs, like
Deinonychus, '' Tim said.
``That's right,'' Grant said, ``although the evidence
for pack hunting is all circumstantial. It
derives in part from the appearance of the animals,
which are quick and strong, but small for
dinosaurs-just a hundred and fifty to three hundred
pounds each. We assume they hunted in
groups if they were to bring down larger prey. And
there are some fossil finds in which a single
large prey animal is associated with several raptor
skeletons, suggesting they hunted in packs.
And, of course, raptors were large-brained, more in
telligent than most dinosaurs.''
``How intelligent is that?'' Malcolm asked.
``Depends on who you talk to,'' Grant said. ``Just as
paleontologists have come around to the
idea that dinosaurs were probably warm-blooded, a l
ot of us are starting to think some of them
might have been quite intelligent, too. But nobody
knows for sure.''
They left the visitor area behind, and soon they he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
ard the loud hum of generators, smelled the
faint odor of gasoline. They passed a grove of palm
trees and saw a large, low concrete shed
with a steel roof. The noise seemed to come from th
ere. They looked in the shed.
``It must be a generator,'' Ellie said. ``It's

<p/>big,'' Grant said, peering inside.
The power plant actually extended two stories below
ground level: a vast complex of whining
turbines and piping that ran down in the earth, lit
by harsh electric bulbs. ``They can't need all this

<p/>just for a resort,'' Malcolm said. ``They're generati
ng enough power here for a small city.''
``Maybe for the computers?''
``Maybe.''
Grant heard bleating, and walked north a few yards.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) came to an animal enclosure with
goats. By a quick count, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) estimated there were fi
fty or sixty goats.
``What's that for?'' Ellie asked.
``Beats me.''
``Probably they feed 'em to the dinosaurs,'' Malcolm
said.
The group walked on, following a dirt path through
a dense bamboo grove. At the far side, they
came to a double-layer chain-link fence twelve feet
high, with spirals of barbed wire at the top.
There was an electric hum along the outer fence.
Beyond the fences, Grant saw dense clusters of larg
e ferns, five feet high. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heard a snorting
sound, a kind of snuffling. Then the sound of crunc
hing footsteps, coming closer.
Then a long silence.
``I don't see anything,'' Tim whispered, finally.
``Ssssh.''
Grant waited. Several seconds passed. Flies buzzed
in the air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) still saw nothing.
Ellie tapped him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) on the shoulder, and pointed.
Amid the ferns, Grant saw the head of an animal. It
was motionless, partially hidden in the
fronds, the two large dark eyes watching them coldl
y.
The head was two feet long. From a pointed snout, a
long row of teeth ran back to the hole of
the auditory meatus which served as an ear. The hea
d reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) of a large lizard, or perhaps
a crocodile. The eyes did not blink, and the animal
did not move. Its skin was leathery, with a
pebbled texture, and basically the same coloration
as the infant's: yellow-brown with darker
reddish markings, like the stripes of a tiger.
As Grant watched, a single forelimb reached up very
slowly to part the ferns beside the
animal's face. The limb, Grant saw, was strongly mu
scled. The hand had three grasping fingers,
each ending in curved claws. The band gently, slowl
y, pushed aside the ferns.
Grant felt a chill and thought, He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)'s hunting us.
For a mammal like man, there was something indescri
bably alien about the way reptiles
hunted their prey. No wonder men hated reptiles. Th
e stillness, the coldness, the pace was all
wrong. To be among alligators or other large reptil
es was to be reminded of a different kind of life,
a
different kind of world, now vanished from the eart
h. Of course, this animal didn't realize that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
had been spotted, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)-
The attack came suddenly, from the left and right.
Charging raptors covered the ten yards to
the fence with shocking speed. Grant had a blurred
impression of powerful, six-foot-tall bodies,
stiff balancing tails, limbs with curving claws, op
en jaws with rows of jagged teetb.
The animals snarled as they came forward, and then
leapt bodily into the air, raising their hind
legs with their big dagger-claws. Then they struck
the fence in front of them, throwing off twin
bursts of hot sparks.
The veloctiraptors fell backward to the ground, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
sing. The visitors all moved forward,
fascinated. Only then did the third animal attack,
leaping up to strike the fence at chest level. Tim
screamed in fright as the sparks exploded all aroun
d him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>). The creatures snarled, a low reptilian
hissing sound, and leapt back among the ferns. Then
they were gone, leaving behind a faint odor
of decay, and banging acrid smoke.
``Holy shit,'' Tim said.
``It was so fast,'' Ellie said.
``Pack hunters,'' Grant said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head. ``Pack
hunters for whom ambush is an instinct . .
. Fascinating.''
``I wouldn't call them tremendously intelligent,<div class="bookquote">'' Ma
lcolm said.
On the other side of the fence, they heard snorting
in the palm trees. Several heads poked
slowly out of the foliage. Grant counted three . .
. four ... five ... The animals watched them.
Staring coldly.
A black man in coveralls came running up to them. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Are you all right?''
``We're okay,'' Grant said.
``The alarms were set off.'' The man looked at the fe
nce, dented and charred. ``They attacked
you?''
``Three of them did, yes.''
The black man nodded. ``They do that all the time. H
it the fence, take a shock. They never
seem to mind.''
``Not too smart, are they?'' Malcolm said.
The black man paused. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) squinted at Malcolm in the
afternoon light, ``Be glad for that fence,
seor, '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, and turned away.
From beginning to end, the entire attack could not
have taken more than six seconds. Grant was
still trying to organize his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) impressions. The speed
was astonishing-the animals were so fast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
had hardly seen them move.
Walking back, Malcolm said, ``They are remarkably fa
st.''
``Yes,'' Grant said. ``Much faster than any living rep
tile. A bull alligator can move quickly, but
only over a short distance-five or six feet. Big li
zards like the five-foot Komodo dragons of
Indonesia have been clocked at thirty miles an hour
, fast enough to run down a man. And they kill
men all the time. But I'd guess the animal behind t
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fence was more than twice that fast.''
``Cheetah speed,'' Malcolm said. ``Sixty, seventy mile
s an hour.''
``Exactly.''
``But they seemed to dart forward,'' Malcolm said. ``R
ather like birds.''
``Yes.'' In the contemporary world, only very small m
ammals, like the cobra-fighting mongoose,
had such quick responses. Small mammals, and of cou
rse birds. The snake-hunting secretary
bird of Africa, or the cassowary. In fact, the velo
ciraptor conveyed precisely the same impression
of deadly, swift menace Grant had seen in the casso
wary, the clawed ostrich-like bird of New
Guinea.
``So these velociraptors look like reptiles, with th
e skin and general appearance of reptiles, but
they move like birds, with the speed and predatory
intelligence of birds. Is that about it?'' Malcolm
said.
``Yes,'' Grant said. ``I'd say they display a mixture
of traits.''
``Does that surprise you?''
``Not really,'' Grant said. ``It's actually rather clo
se to what paleontologists believed a long time
ago.''
When the first giant bones were found in the 1820s
and 1830s, scientists felt obliged to explain
the bones as belonging to some oversize variant of
a modern species. This was because it was
believed that no species could ever become extinct,
since God would not allow one of His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
creations to die.
Eventually it became clear that this conception of
God was mistaken, and the bones belonged
to extinct animals. But what kind of animals?
In 1842, Richard Owen, the leading British anatomis
t of the day, called them Dinosauria,
meaning ``terrible lizards.'' Owen recognized that di
nosaurs seemed to combine traits of lizards,
crocodiles, and birds. In particular, dinosaur hips
were bird-like, not lizard-like. And, unlike lizar
ds,
many dinosaurs seemed to stand upright. Owen imagin
ed dinosaurs to be quick-moving, active
creatures, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) view was accepted for the next f
orty years.
But when truly gigantic finds were unearthed-animal
s that had weighed a hundred tons in life-
scientists began to envision the dinosaurs as stupi
d, slow-moving giants destined for extinction.
The image of the sluggish reptile gradually predomi
nated over the image of the quick-moving
bird. In recent years, scientists like Grant had be
gun to swing back toward the idea of more active
dinosaurs. Grant's colleagues saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) as radical in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) conception of dinosaur behavior. But now
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had to admit his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) own conception had fallen far s
hort of the reality of these large, incredibly
swift hunters.
``Actually, what I was driving at,'' Malcolm said, ``w
as this: Is it a persuasive animal to you? Is it
in fact a dinosaur?''
``I'd say so, yes.''
``And the coordinated attack behavior ...''
``To be expected,'' Grant said. According to the foss
il record, packs of velociraptors were
capable of bringing down animals that weighed a tho
usand pounds, like Tenontosaurus, which
could run as fast as a horse. Coordination would be
required.
``How do they do that, without language?''
``Oh, language isn't necessary for coordinated hunti
ng,'' Ellie said. ``Chimpanzees do it all the
time. A group of chimps will stalk a monkey and kil
l it. All communication is by eyes.''
``And were the dinosaurs in fact attacking us?''
``Yes.''
``They would kill us and eat us if they could?'' Malc
olm said.
``I think so.''
``The reason I ask,'' Malcolm said, ``is that I'm told
large predators such as lions and tigers are
not born man-eaters. Isn't that true? These animals
must learn somewhere along the way that
human beings are easy to kill. Only afterward do th
ey become man-killers.''
``Yes, I believe that's true,'' Grant said.
``Well, these dinosaurs must be even more reluctant
than lions and tigers. After all, they come
from a time before human beings-or even large mamma
ls-existed at all. God knows what they
think when they see us. So I wonder: have they lear
ned, somewhere along the line, that humans
are easy to kill?''
The group fell silent as they walked.
``In any case,'' Malcolm said, ``I shall be extremely
interested to see the control room now.''
Version 4.4
``Was there any problem with the group?'' Hammond ask
ed.
``No,'' Henry Wu said, <div class="bookquote">``there was no problem at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They accepted your explanation?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said. ``It's all quite stra
ightforward, in the broad strokes. It's only the
details that get sticky. And I wanted to talk about
the details with you today. You can think of it as

<p/>a matter of aesthetics.''
John Hammond wrinkled his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) nose, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) smelled so
mething disagreeable. ``Aesthetics?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)
repeated.
They were standing in the living room of Hammond's
elegant bungalow, set back among palm
trees in the northern sector of the park. The livin
g room was airy and comfortable, fitted with a
half-dozen video monitors showing the animals in th
e park. The file Wu had brought, stamped
ANIMAL DEVELOPMENT: VERSION 4.4, lay on the coffee
table.
Hammond was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) in that patient, paterna
l way. Wu, thirty-three years old, was
acutely aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) had worked for Hammond all hi
s professional life. Hammond had hired him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)
right out of graduate school.
``Of course, there are practical consequences as wel
l,'' Wu said. ``I really think you should
consider my recommendations for phase two. We shoul
d go to version 4.4.''
``You want to replace all the current stock of anima
ls?'' Hammond said.
``Yes, I do.''
``Why? What's wrong with them?''
``Nothing,'' Wu said, ``except that they're real dinos
aurs.''
``That's what I asked for, Henry,'' Hammond said, smi
ling. ``And that's what you gave me.'' ``I
know,'' Wu said. ``But you see...'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) paused. How c
ould he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) explain this to Hammond?
Hammond hardly ever visited the island. And it was
a peculiar situation that Wu was trying to
convey. ``Right now, as we stand here, almost no one
in the world has ever seen an actual
dinosaur. Nobody knows what they're really like.''
``Yes ...''
``The dinosaurs we have now are real,'' Wu said, poin
ting to the screens around the room, ``but
in certain ways they are unsatisfactory, Unconvinci
ng. I could make them better.''
``Better in what way?''
``For one thing, they move too fast,'' Henry Wu said.
``People aren't accustomed to seeing large
animals that are so quick. I'm afraid visitors will
think the dinosaurs look speeded up, like film
running too fast.''
``But, Henry, these are real dinosaurs. You said so
yourself.''
``I know,'' Wu said. ``But we could easily breed slowe
r, more domesticated dinosaurs.''
``Domesticated dinosaurs?'' Hammond snorted. ``Nobody
wants domesticated dinosaurs,
Henry. They want the real thing.''
``But that's my point,'' Wu said. ``I don't think they
do. They want to see their expectation, which
is quite different.''
Hammond was frowning.
``You said yourself, John, this park is entertainmen
t,'' Wu said. ``And entertainment has nothing
to do with reality. Entertainment is antithetical t
o reality.''
Hammond sighed. ``Now, Henry, are we going to have a
nother one of those abstract
discussions? You know I like to keep it simple. The
dinosaurs we have now are real, and-''
``Well, not exactly,'' Wu said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) paced the living r
oom, pointed to the monitors. ``I don't think we
should kid ourselves. We haven't re-created the pas
t here. The past is gone. It can never be re-
created. What we've done is reconstruct the past-or
at least a version of the past. And I'm saying
we can make a better version.''
``Better than real?''
``Why not?'' Wu said. ``After all, these animals are a
lready modified. We've inserted genes to
make them patentable, and to make them lysine depen
dent. And we've done everything we can
to promote growth, and accelerate development into
adulthood.''
Hammond shrugged. ``That was inevitable. We didn't w
ant to wait. We have investors to
consider.''
``Of course. But I'm `ust saying, why stop there? Wh
y not push ahead to make exactly the kind
of dinosaur that we'd like to see? One that is more
acceptable to visitors, and one that is easier
for us to handle? A slower, more docile version for
our park?''
Hammond frowned. ``But then the dinosaurs wouldn't b
e real.''
``But they're not real now,'' Wu said. ``That's what I
'm trying to tell you. There isn't any reality
here.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) shrugged helplessly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) could see he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) wasn
't getting through. Hammond had never
been interested in technical details, and the essen
ce of the argument was technical. How could
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) explain to Hammond about the reality of DNA drop
outs, the patches, the gaps in the sequence
that Wu had been obliged to fill in, making the bes
t guesses he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) could, but still, making guesses,
The DNA of the dinosaurs was like old photographs t
hat had been retouched, basically the same
as the original but in some places repaired and cla
rified, and as a result-
``Now, Henry,'' Hammond said, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) arm around
Wu's shoulder. ``If you don't mind my
saying so, I think you're getting cold feet. You've
been working very hard for a long time, and
you've done a hell of a job-a hell of a job-and it'
s finally time to reveal to some people what you've

<p/>done. It's natural to be a little nervous. To have
some doubts. But I am convinced, Henry, that the
world will be entirely satisfied. Entirely satisfie
d.''
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) spoke, Hammond steered him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) toward the door.
``But, John,'' Wu said. ``Remember back in '87, when w
e started to build the containment
devices? We didn't have any full-grown adults yet,
so we had to predict what we'd need- We
ordered big taser shockers, cars with cattle prods
mounted on them, guns that blow out electric
nets. All built specially to our specifications. We
've got a whole array of devices now and they're
all too slow. We've got to make some adjustments. Y
ou know that Muldoon wants military
equipment: TOW missiles and laser-guided devices?''
``Let's leave Muldoon out of this,'' Hammond said. ``I
'm not worried. It's just a zoo, Henry.''
The phone rang, and Hammond went to answer it. Wu t
ried to think of another way to press his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)
case. But the fact was that, after five long years,
Jurassic Park was nearing completion, and John
Hammond lust wasn't listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) any more.
There had been a time when Hammond listened to Wu v
ery attentively. Especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) had
first recruited him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>), back in the days when Henry Wu
was a twenty-eight-year-old graduate
student getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) doctorate at Stanford in Norman
Atherton's tab.
Atherton's death had thrown the lab into confusion
as well as mourning; no one knew what
would happen to the funding or the doctoral program
s. There was a lot of uncertainty; people
worried about their careers.
Two weeks after the funeral, John Hammond came to s
ee Wu. Everyone in the lab knew that
Atherton had had some association with Hammond, alt
hough the details were never clear. But
Hammond had approached Wu with a directness Wu neve
r forgot.
``Norman always said you're the best geneticist in h
is lab,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) said. ``What are your plans now?''
``I don't know. Research.''
``You want a university appointment?''
``Yes.''
``That's a mistake,'' Hammond said briskly. ``At least
, if you respect your talent.''
Wu had blinked. ``Why?''
``Because, let's face facts,'' Hammond said. ``Univers
ities are no longer the intellectual centers
of the country. The very idea is preposterous. Univ
ersities are the backwater. Don't look so
surprised. I'm not saying anything you don't know.
Since World War II, all the really important
discoveries have come out of private laboratories.
The laser, the transistor the polio vaccine, the
microchip, the hologram, the personal computer, mag
netic resonance imaging, CAT scans-the
list goes on and on. Universities simply aren't whe
re it's happening any more. And they haven't
been for forty years. If you want to do something i
mportant in computers or genetics, you don't go
to a university. Dear me, no.''
Wu found he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) was speechless.
``Good heavens,'' Hammond said, ``what must you go thr
ough to start a new project? How
many grant applications, how many forms, how many a
pprovals? The steering committee? The
department chairman? The university resources commi
ttee? How do you get more work space if
you need I . t? More assistants if you need them? H
ow long does all that take? A brilliant man
can't squander precious time with forms and committ
ees. Life is too short, and DNA too long. You
want to make your mark. If you want to get somethin
g done, stay out of universities.''
In those days, Wu desperately wanted to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) ma
rk. John Hammond had his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) full attention.
``I'm talking about work, '' Hammond continued. ``Real
accomplishment. What does a scientist
need to work? He (<font color='blue'><b>scientist</b></font>) needs time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>scientist</b></font>) needs money. I'
m talking about giving you a five-year
commitment, and ten million dollars a year in fundi
ng. Fifty million dollars, and no one tells you
how to spend it. You decide. Everyone else just get
s out of your way.''
It sounded too good to be true. Wu was silent for a
long time. Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) said, ``In return for
what?''
``For taking a crack at the impossible,'' Hammond sai
d. ``For trying something that probably
can't be done.''
``What does it involve?''
``I can't give you details, but the general area inv
olves cloning reptiles.''
``I don't think that's impossible,'' Wu said. ``Reptil
es are easier than mammals. Cloning's
probably only ten, fifteen years off. Assuming some
fundamental advances.''
``I've got five years,'' Hammond said. ``And a lot of
money, for somebody who wants to take a
crack at it now.''
``Is my work publishable?''
``Eventually.''
``Not immediately?''
``But eventually publishable?'' Wu asked, sticking on
this point.
Hammond had laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Don't worry. If you succeed,
the whole world will know about what
you've done, I promise you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And now it seemed the whole world would indeed know
, Wu thought. After five years of
extraordinary effort, they were just a year away fr
om opening the park to the public. Of course,
those years hadn't gone exactly as Hammond had prom
ised. Wu had had some people telling
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) what to do, and many times fearsome pressures w
ere placed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>). And the work itself had
shifted-it wasn't even reptilian cloning, once they
began to understand that dinosaurs were so
similar to birds. It was avian cloning, a very diff
erent proposition. Much more difficult. And for the

<p/>last two years, Wu had been primarily an administra
tor, supervising teams of researchers and
banks of computer-operated gene sequencers. Adminis
tration wasn't the kind of work he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>)
relished. It wasn't what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) had bargained for.
Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) had succeeded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) had done what nobody re
ally believed could be done, at least in so
short a time. And Henry Wu thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) should h
ave some rights, some say in what
happened, by virtue of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) expertise and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) effort
s. Instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) influence waning with
each passing day. The dinosaurs existed. The proced
ures for obtaining them were worked out to
the point of being routine. The technologies were m
ature. And John Hammond didn't need Henry
Wu any more.
<div class="bookquote">``That should be fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said, speaking into
the phone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) listened for a while, and
smiled at Wu. <div class="bookquote">``Fine. Yes. Fine.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) hung up. <div class="bookquote">``Where
were we, Henry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We were talking about phase two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh yes. We've gone over some of this before, Henry
-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know, but you don't realize-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said, with an edge of i
mpatience in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) voice. ``I do realize. And
I must tell you frankly, Henry. I see no reason to
improve upon reality. Every change we've made
in the genome has been forced on us by law or neces
sity. We may make other changes in the
future, to resist disease, or for other reasons. Bu
t I don't think we should improve upon reality just

<p/>because we think it's better that way. We have real
dinosaurs out there now. That's what people
want to see. And that's what they should see. That'
s our obligation, Henry. That's honest, Henry.''
And, smiling, Hammond opened the door for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) to le
ave.
Control
Grant looked at all the computer monitors in the da
rkened control room, feeling irritable. Grant
didn't like computers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) knew that this made him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) o
ld-fashioned, dated as a researcher, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
didn't care. Some of the kids who worked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) ha
d a real feeling for computers, an intuition.
Grant never felt that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) found computers to be ali
en, mystifying machines. Even the fundamental
distinction between an operating system and an appl
ication left him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) confused and disheartened,
literally lost in a foreign geography he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) didn't beg
in to comprehend. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) noticed that Gennaro
was perfectly comfortable, and Malcolm seemed to be
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) element, making little sniffing
sounds, like a bloodhound on a trail.
``You want to know about control mechanisms?'' John A
rnold said, turning in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) chair in the
control room. The head engineer was a thin, tense,
chain-smoking man of forty-five. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) squinted
at the others in the room. ``We have unbelievable co
ntrol mechanisms,'' Arnold said, and lit
another cigarette.
``For example,'' Gennaro said.
``For example, animal tracking.'' Arnold pressed a bu
tton on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) console, and the vertical glass
map lit up with a pattern of jagged blue lines. ``Th
at's our juvenile T-rex. The little rex. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
movements within the park over the last twenty-four
hours.'' Arnold pressed the button again.
``Previous twenty-four.'' And again. ``Previous twenty
-four.''
The lines on the map became densely overlaid, a chi
ld's scribble. But the scribble was
localized in a single area, near the southeast side
of the lagoon.
``You get a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) home range over time,'' Arno
ld said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'s young, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stays close to
the water. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stays away from the big adult rex
. You put up the big rex and the little rex, and
you'll see their paths never cross.
<div class="bookquote">``Where is the big rex right now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro asked.
Arnold pushed another button. The map cleared, and
a single glowing spot with a code
number appeared in the fields northwest of the lago
on. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'s right there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the little rex?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hell, I'll show you every animal in the park,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Arn
old said. The map began to light up like a
Christmas tree, dozens of spots of light, each tagg
ed with a code number. <div class="bookquote">``That's two hundred
thirty-eight animals as of this minute.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How accurate?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Within five feet.''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold puffed on the cigarette.
``Let's put it this way: you drive out in a vehicle

<p/>and you will find the animals right there, exactly
as they're shown on the map.''
``How often is this updated?''
``Every thirty seconds.''
``Pretty impressive,'' Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``How's it done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have motion sensors all around the park,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnol</b></font>)</div>Arnol
d said. <div class="bookquote">``Most of 'em hard-wired, some
radio-telemetered. Of course, motion sensors won't
usually tell you the species, but we get image
recognition direct off the video. Even when we're n
ot watching the video monitors, the computer
is. And checking where everybody is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Does the computer ever make a mistake?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only with the babies. It mixes those up sometimes,
because they're such small images. But
we don't sweat that. The babies almost always stay
close to herds of adults. Also you have the

said, <div class="bookquote">``Look, Dr. Grant, there's no point

everywhere else. And if the computer tracks an anim

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But if one did get out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
Arnold snorted, and stubbed out his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) cigarette.
<div class="bookquote">``Just hypothetically,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``Supposing it

 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) throat. <div class="bookquote">``We'd go out and get th

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Gennaro nodded. <div class="bookquote">``And if one got off the island?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It'd die in less than twenty-four hours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold s

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a pause. Arnold puffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) cigarette. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
ll of a system,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Hell of a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then I guess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said, <div class="bookquote">``your system works so

 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We've got endless problems here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said, rai
sing an eyebrow. ``But none of the things
you worry about. I gather you're worried that the a
nimals will escape, and will get to the mainland
and raise hell. We haven't got any concern about th
at at all. We see these animals as fragile and
delicate. They've been brought back after sixty-fiv
e million years to a world that's very different
from the one they left, the one they were adapted t
o. We have a hell of a time caring for them.
``You have to realize,'' Arnold continued, ``that men
have been keeping mammals and reptiles in
zoos for hundreds of years. So we know a lot about
how to take care of an elephant or a croc.
But nobody has ever tried to take care of a dinosau
r before. They are new animals. And we just
don't know. Diseases in our animals are the biggest
concern.''
``Diseases?'' Gennaro said, suddenly alarmed. ``Is the
re any way that a visitor could get sick?''
Arnold snorted again. ``You ever catch a cold from a
zoo alligator, Mr. Gennaro? Zoos don't
worry about that. Neither do we. What we do worry a
bout is the animals dying from their own
illnesses, or infecting other animals. But we have
programs to monitor that, too. You want to see
the big rex's health file? His (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) vaccination record?
His (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) dental record? That's something-you ought
to see the vets scrubbing those big fangs so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) doe
sn't get tooth decay.
<div class="bookquote">``Not just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``What about your mech
anical systems?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You mean the rides?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said.
Grant looked up sharply: rides?
<div class="bookquote">``None of the rides are running yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold was say
ing. <div class="bookquote">``We have the jungle River Ride, where
the boats follow tracks underwater, and we have the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``You're going to have

 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said, <div class="bookquote">``This is a zoological park. We have to

rides. That's all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Grant frowned. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) felt troubled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) didn't li
ke the idea of dinosaurs being used for an
amusement park.
Malcolm continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) questions. <div class="bookquote">``You can run the w

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``I can run it single-handed, if

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This is the system Mr. Nedry designed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm as

<div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nedry/Dennis Nedry/Dennis</b></font>)</div>Nedry said, not looking up fro

<div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nedry/Dennis Nedry/Dennis</b></font>)</div>Nedry said absently. <div class="bookquote">``Just one or t

 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold was punching buttons. Another screen came up
.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can do all of that, and very quickly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold s
aid. <div class="bookquote">``The computer takes measurement data in
the course of reading the video screens, so it is t

er larger or smaller than the average, at the
tails of the curve.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'd expect that kind of graph,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes. Any healthy biological population shows this

lighting another cigarette, <div class="bookquote">``are there any other qu

 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said. <div class="bookquote">``I've learned what I need to kn

 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>As they were walking out, Gennaro said, <div class="bookquote">``It looks l
ike a pretty good system to me. I don't see
how any animals could get off this island,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said. <div class="bookquote">``I thought it was comple

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``You think animals h
ave gotten out?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know they have.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said, ``But how? You saw for yourself. They
can count all the animals. They can look
at all the animals. They know where all the animals
are at all times. How can one possibly
escape?
Malcolm smiled. ``It's quite obvious,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) said. ``It'
s just a matter of your assumptions.''
``Your assumptions,'' Gennaro repeated, frowning.
``Yes,'' Malcolm said. ``Look here. The basic event th
at has occurred in Jurassic Park is that the
scientists and technicians have tried to make a new
, complete biological world. And the scientists
in the control room expect to see a natural world.
As in the graph they just showed us. Even
though a moment's thought reveals that nice, normal
distribution is terribly worrisome on this
island.''
``It is?''
``Yes. Based on what Dr. Wu told us earlier, one sho
uld never see a population graph like that.''
``Why not?'' Gennaro said.
``Because that is a graph for a normal biological po
pulation. Which is precisely what Jurassic
Park is not. Jurassic Park is not the real world. I
t is intended to be a controlled world that only
imitates the natural world. In that sense, it's a t
rue park, rather like a Japanese formal garden.
Nature manipulated to be more natural than the real
thing, if you will.''
``I'm afraid you've lost me,'' Gennaro said, looking
annoyed. ``I'm
sure the tour will make everything clear,'' Malcolm
said.
The Tour
``This way, everybody, this way,'' Ed Regis said. By
his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) side, a woman was passing out pith
helmets with ``Jurassic Park'' labeled on the headban
d, and a little blue dinosaur logo.
A line of Toyota Land Cruisers came out of an under
ground garage beneath the visitor center.
Each car pulled up, driverless and silent. Two blac
k men in safari uniforms were opening the
doors for passengers.
``Two to four passengers to a car, please, two to fo
ur passengers to a car,'' a recorded voice
was saying. ``Children under ten must be accompanied
by an adult. Two to four passengers to a
car, please ...''
Tim watched as Grant, Sattler, and Malcolm got into
the first Land Cruiser with the lawyer,
Gennaro. Tim looked over at Lex, who was standing p
ounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) fist into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) glove.
Tim pointed to the first car and said, ``Can I go wi
th them?''
``I'm afraid they have things to discuss,'' Ed Regis
said. ``Technical things.''
``I'm interested in technical things,'' Tim said. ``I'
d rather go with them.''
``Well, you'll be able to hear what they're saying,''
Regis said. ``We'll have a radio open between
the cars.''
The second car came. Tim and Lex got in, and Ed Reg
is followed. ``These are electric cars,''
Regis said. ``Guided by a cable in the roadway.''
Tim was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was sitting in the front seat, beca
use mounted in the dashboard were two
computer Screens and a box that looked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) like
a CD-ROM; that was a laser disk player
controlled by a computer. There was also a portable
walkie-talkie and some kind of a radio
transmitter. There were two antennas on the roof, a
nd some odd goggles in the map pocket.
The black men shut the doors of the Land Cruiser. T
he (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) car started off with an electric hum. Up
ahead, the three scientists and Gennaro were talkin
g and pointing, clearly excited. Ed Regis said,
``Let's hear what they are saying.'' An intercom clic
ked.
``I don't know what the hell you think you're doing
here,'' Gennaro said, over the intercom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
sounded very angry.
``I know quite well why I'm here,'' Malcolm said.
``You're here to advise me, not play goddamned mind
games. I've got five percent of this
company and a responsibility to make sure that Hamm
ond has done his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamm</b></font>) job responsibly. Now
you goddamn come here-''
Ed Regis pressed the intercom button and said, ``In
keeping with the nonpolluting policies of
Jurassic Park, these lightweight electric Land Crui
sers have been specially built for us by Toyota in
Osaka. Eventually we hope to drive among the animal
s-just as they do in African game parks- but,
for now, sit back and enjoy the self-guided tour.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) paused. ``And, by the way, we can hear
you back here.''
``Oh Christ,'' Gennaro said. ``I have to be able to sp
eak freely. I didn't ask for these damned kids
to come-''
Ed Regis smiled blandly and pushed a button. ``We'll
just begin the show, shall we?'' They
heard a fanfare of trumpets, and the interior scree
ns flashed WELCOME TO JURASSIC PARK. A
sonorous voice said, ``Welcome to Jurassic Park. You
are now entering the lost world of the
prehistoric past, a world of mighty creatures long
gone from the face of the earth, which you are
privileged to see for the first time.''
``That's Richard Kiley,'' Ed Regis said. ``We spared n
o expense.''
The Land Cruiser passed through a grove of low, stu
mpy palm trees. Richard Kiley was
saying, ``Notice, first of all, the remarkable plant
life that surrounds you. Those trees to your left
and right are called cycads, the prehistoric predec
essors of palm trees. Cycads were a favorite
food of the dinosaurs. You can also see bennettital
eans, and ginkgoes. The world of the dinosaur
included more modern plants, such as pine and fir t
rees, and swamp cypresses. You will see
these as well.''
The Land Cruiser moved slowly among the foliage. Ti
m noticed the fences and retaining walls
were screened by greenery to heighten the illusion
of moving through real jungle.
``We imagine the world of the dinosaurs,'' said Richa
rd Kiley's voice, ``as a world of huge
vegetarians, eating their way through the giant swa
mpy forests of the Jurassic and Cretaceous
world, a hundred million years ago. But most dinosa
urs were not as large as people think. The
smallest dinosaurs were no bigger than a house cat,
and the average dinosaur was about as big
as a pony. We are first going to visit one of these
average-size animals, called hypsilophodonts.
If you look to your left, you may catch a glimpse o
f them now.''
They all looked to the left.
The Land Cruiser stopped on a low rise, where a bre
ak in the foliage provided a view to the
east. They could see a sloping forested area which
opened into a field of yellow grass that was
about three feet high. There were no dinosaurs.
``Where are they?'' Lex said.
Tim looked at the dashboard. The transmitter lights
blinked and the CD-ROM whirred.
Obviously the disk was being accessed by some autom
atic system. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) guessed that the same
motion sensors that tracked the animals also contro
lled the screens in the Land Cruiser. The
screens now showed pictures of hypsilophodonts, and
printed out data about them.
The voice said, ``Hypsilophodontids are the gazelles
of the dinosaur world: small, quick animals
that once roamed everywhere in the world, from Engl
and to Central Asia to North America. We
think these dinosaurs were so successful because th
ey had better jaws and teeth for chewing
plants than their contemporaries did. In fact, the
name `hypsilophodontid' means `high-ridge
tooth,' which refers to the characteristic self-sha
rpening teeth of these animals. You can see them
in the plains directly ahead, and also perhaps in t
he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) branches of the trees.''
``In the trees?'' Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``Dinosaurs in the trees?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div><p/>Tim was scanning with binoculars, too. <div class="bookquote">``To the righ
t,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Halfway up that big green trunk
...''
 (<font color='red'><b>rk</b></font>)</div>In the dappled shadows of the tree a motionless, da
rk green animal about the size of a baboon
stood on a branch. It looked like a lizard standing
on its hind legs. It balanced itself with a long
drooping tail.
<div class="bookquote">``That's an othnielia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
<div class="bookquote">``The small animals you see are called othnielia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) voice said, <div class="bookquote">``in honor of the nineteenth-
century dinosaur hunter Othniel Marsh of Yale.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Tim spotted two more animals, on higher branches of
the same tree. They were all about the
same size. None of them were moving.
<div class="bookquote">``Pretty boring,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``They're not doing anyth
ing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The main herd of animals can be found in the grass
y plain below you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the voice. <div class="bookquote">``We
can rouse them with a simple mating call.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A loudsp
eaker by the fence gave a long nasal call, like
the honking of geese.
From the field of grass directly to their left, six
lizard heads poked up, one after another. The
effect was comical, and Tim laughed.
The heads disappeared. The loudspeaker gave the cal
l again, and once again the heads
poked up-in exactly the same way, one after another
. The fixed repetition of the behavior was
striking.
<div class="bookquote">``Hypsilophodonts are not especially bright animals,
''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the voice explained. <div class="bookquote">``They have roughly
the intelligence of a domestic cow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>blacks</b></font>)</div>The heads were dull green, with a mottling of dark
browns and blacks that extended down the
slender necks. Judging from the size of the heads,
Tim guessed their bodies were four feet long,
about as large as deer.
Some of the hypsilophodonts were chewing, the jaws
working. One reached up and scratched
its head, with a five-fingered band. The gesture ga
ve the creature a pensive, thoughtful quality.
<div class="bookquote">``If you see them scratching, that is because they h
ave skin problems. The veterinary scientists
here at Jurassic Park think it may be a fungus, or
an allergy. But they're not sure yet. After all,
these are the first dinosaurs in history ever to be
studied alive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The electric motor of the car started, and there wa
s a grinding of gears. At the unexpected
sound, the herd of hypsilophodonts suddenly leapt i
nto the air and bounded above the grass like
kangaroos, showing their full bodies with massive h
ind limbs and long tails in the afternoon
sunlight. In a few leaps, they were gone.
<div class="bookquote">``Now that we've had a look at these fascinating her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)

rough Jurassic Park.
Control
<div class="bookquote">``Gears are grinding,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Arnold</b></font>)</div>John Arnold said, in the dark
ened control room. <div class="bookquote">``Have maintenance check
the electric clutches on vehicles BB4 and BB5 when
they come back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Arnold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>replied the voice on the interco
m.
<div class="bookquote">``A minor detail,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said, walking in the room
. Looking out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) could see the two Land
Cruisers moving south through the park. Muldoon sto
od in the corner, silently watching.
Arnold pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) chair back from the central conso
le at the control panel. <div class="bookquote">``There are no minor
details, Mr. Hammond,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) lit another
cigarette. Nervous at most times, Arnold was
especially edgy now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) was only too aware that thi
s was the first time visitors had actually
toured the park. In fact, Arnold's team didn't ofte
n go into the park. Harding, the vet, sometimes
did. The animal handlers went to the individual fee
ding houses. But otherwise they watched the
park from the control room. And now, with visitors
out there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) worried about a hundred details.
John Arnold was a systems engineer who had worked o
n the Polaris submarine missile in the
late 1960s, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) first child and the pr
ospect of making weapons became too
distasteful. Meanwhile, Disney had started to creat
e amusement park rides of great technological
sophistication, and they employed a lot of aerospac
e people. Arnold helped build Disney World in
Orlando, and had gone on to implement major Parks a
t Magic Mountain in California, Old
Country in Virginia, and Astroworld in Houston.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) continuous employment at parks had eventually g
iven him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) a somewhat skewed view of
reality. Arnold contended, only half jokingly, that
the entire world was increasingly described by
the metaphor of the theme park. <div class="bookquote">``Paris is a theme p
ark,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) once announced, after a vacation,
<div class="bookquote">``although it's too expensive, and the park employee
s are unpleasant and sullen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For the past two years, Arnold's job had been to ge
t Jurassic Park up and running. As an
engineer, he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) was accustomed to long time schedules-
he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) often referred to <div class="bookquote">``the September
opening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>by which he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) meant September of the follow
ing year-and as the September opening
approached, he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) was unhappy with the progress that h
ad been made. He (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) knew from experience
that it sometimes took years to work the bugs out o
f a single park ride-let alone get a whole park
running properly.
<div class="bookquote">``You're just a worrier,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``You've got to rea
lize that, from an engineering standpoint,
Jurassic Park is by far the most ambitious theme pa
rk in history. Visitors will never think about it,
but I do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) ticked the points off on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) fingers.
``First, Jurassic Park has all the problems of any a
musement park-ride maintenance, queue
control, transportation, food handling, living acco
mmodations, trash disposal, security.
``Second, we have all the problems of a major zoo-ca
re of the animals; health and welfare;
feeding and cleanliness; protection from insects, p
ests, allergies, and illnesses- maintenance of
barriers; and all the rest.
<div class="bookquote">``And, finally, we have the unprecedented problems o

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's not as bad as all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is. You're just not here to see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnol</b></font>)</div>Arnol

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. And they promptly chewed the collars off. But
even if the raptors never get free,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold
said, <div class="bookquote">``I think we have to accept that Jurassic Park
is
inherently hazardous.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh balls, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said. ``Whose side are you on,
anyway?
``We now have fifteen species of extinct animals, an
d most of them are dangerous,'' Arnold
said. ``We've been forced to delay the jungle River
Ride because of the dilophosaurs; and the
Pteratops Lodge in the aviary, because the pterodac
tyls are so unpredictable. These aren't
engineering delays, Mr. Hammond. They're problems w
ith control of the animals.''
``You've had plenty of engineering delays,'' Hammond
said. ``Don't blame it on the animals.''
``Yes, we have. In fact, it's all we could do to get
the main attraction, Park Drive, working
correctly, to get the CD-ROMs inside the cars to be
controlled by the motion sensors. It's taken
weeks of adjustment to get that working properly-an
d now the electric gearshifts on the cars are
acting up! The gearshifts!''
``Let's keep it in perspective,'' Hammond said. ``You
get the engineering correct and the animals
will fall into place. After all, they're trainable.
''
From the beginning, this had been one of the core b
eliefs of the planners. The animals,
however exotic, would fundamentally behave like ani
mals in zoos anywhere. They would learn
the regularities of their care, and they would resp
ond.
``Meanwhile, how's the computer?'' Hammond said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) g
lanced at Dennis Nedry, who was
working at a terminal in the corner of the room. ``T
his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) damn computer has always been a
headache.''
``We're getting there,'' Nedry said.
``If you had done it right in the first place,'' Hamm
ond began, but Arnold put a restraining band
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) arm. Arnold knew there was no point in antag
onizing Nedry while he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) was working.
``It's a large system,'' Arnold said. ``There are boun
d to be glitches.''
In fact, the bug list now ran to more than 130 item
s, and included many odd aspects. For
example:
The animal-feeding program reset itself every twelv
e hours, not every twenty-four hours, and
would not record feedings on Sundays. As a result,
the staff could not accurately measure how
much the animals were eating.
The security system, which controlled all the secur
ity-card-operated doors, cut out whenever
main power was lost, and did not come back on with
auxiliary power. The security Program only
ran with main power.
The physical conservation program, intended to dim
lights after 10:00 p.m., only worked on
alternate days of the week.
The automated fecal analysis -LRB-called Auto Poop-RRB-, de
signed to check for parasites in the animal
stools, invariably recorded all specimens as having
the parasite Phagostomum venulosum,
although none did. The program then automatically d
ispensed medication into the animals' food. If
the handlers dumped the medicine out of the hoppers
to prevent its being dispensed, an alarm
sounded which could not be turned off.
And so it went, page after page of errors.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>handlers</b></font>) had arrived, Dennis Nedry had been under th
e impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) could make all the
fixes himself over the weekend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) had paled when h
e saw the full listing. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) was calling his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)
office in Cambridge, telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) staff programmers
they were going to have to cancel their
weekend plans and work overtime until Monday. And h
e had told John Arnold that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) would need
to use every telephone link between Isla Nublar and
the mainland just to transfer program data
back and forth to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) programmers.
While Nedry worked, Arnold punched up a new window
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) own monitor. It allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) to
see what Nedry was doing at the corner console. Not
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) didn't trust Nedry. But Arnold just
liked to know what was going on.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) looked at the graphics display on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) right-hand
console, which showed the progress of the
electric Land Cruisers. They were following the riv
er, just north of the aviary, and the
ornithischian paddock.
``If you look to your left,'' said the voice, ``you wi
ll see the dome of the Jurassic Park aviary, which
is
not yet finished for visitors.'' Tim saw sunlight gl
inting off aluminum struts in the distance. ``And
directly below is our Mesozoic jungle river-where,
if you are lucky, you just may catch a glimpse
of a very rare carnivore. Keep your eyes peeled, ev
eryone!''
Inside the Land Cruiser, the screens showed a bird-
like head topped with a flaming red crest.
But everyone in Tim's car was looking out the windo
ws. The car was driving along a high ridge,
overlooking a fast-moving river below. The river wa
s almost enclosed by dense foliage on both
sides.
``There they are now,'' said the voice. ``The animals
you see are called dilophosaurs.''
Despite what the recording said, Tim saw only one.
The dilophosaur crouched on its hind legs
by the river, drinking. It was built on the basic c
arnivore pattern, with a heavy tail, strong hind
limbs, and a long neck. Its ten-foot-tall body was
spotted yellow and black, like a leopard.
But it was the head that held Tim's attention. Two
broad curving crests ran along the top of the
head from the eyes to the nose. The crests met in t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) center, making a V shape above the
dinosaur's head. The crests had red and black strip
es, reminiscent of a parrot or toucan. The
animal gave a soft hooting cry, like an owl.
``They're pretty,'' Lex said.
``Dilophosaurus, '' the tape said, ``is one of the ear
liest carnivorous dinosaurs. Scientists
thought their jaw muscles were too weak to kill pre
y, and imagined they were primarily
scavengers. But now we know they are poisonous.''
``Hey.'' Tim grinned. ``All right.''
Again the distinctive booting call of the dilophosa
ur drifted across the afternoon air toward
them.
Lex shifted uneasily in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) seat. ``Are they really
poisonous, Mr. Regis?''
``Don't worry about it,'' Ed Regis said.
``But are they?''
``Well, yes, Lex.''
``Along with such living reptiles as Gila monsters a
nd rattlesnakes, Dilophosaurus secretes a
hematotoxin from glands in its mouth. Unconsciousne
ss follows within minutes of a bite. The
dinosaur will then finish the victim off at its lei
sure-making Dilophosaurus a beautiful but deadly
addition to the animals you see here at Jurassic Pa
rk.''
The Land Cruiser turned a corner, leaving the river
behind. Tim looked back, hoping for a last
glimpse of the dilophosaur. This was amazing! Poiso
nous dinosaurs! He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could stop
the car, but everything was automatic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) bet Dr. G
rant wanted to stop the car, too.
``If you look on the bluff to the right, you'll see
Les Gigantes, the site of our superb three-star
dining room. Chef Alain Richard hails from the worl
d-famous Le Beaumanire in France. Make
your reservations by dialing four from your hotel r
ooms.''
Tim looked up on the bluff, and saw nothing.
``Not for a while, though,'' Ed Regis said. ``The rest
aurant won't even start construction until
November.''
``Continuing on our prehistoric safari, we come next
to the herbivores of the ornithischian
group. If you look to your right, you can probably
see them now.''
Tim saw two animals, standing motionless in the sha
de of a large tree. Triceratops: the size
and gray color of an elephant, with the truculent s
tance of a rhino. The horns above each eye
curved five feet into the air, looking almost like
inverted elephant tusks. A third, rhino-like born
was located near the nose. And they had the beaky s
nout of a rhino.
``Unlike other dinosaurs,'' the voice said, ``Tricerat
ops serratus can't see well. They're
nearsighted, like the rhinos of today, and they ten
d to be surprised by moving objects. They'd
charge our car if they were close enough to see it!
But relax, folks-we're safe enough here.''
``Triceratops have a fan-shaped crest behind their h
eads. It's made of solid bone, and it's very
strong. These animals weigh about seven tons each.
Despite their appearance, they are actually
quite docile. They know their handlers, and they'll
allow themselves to be petted. They
particularly like to be scratched in the hindquarte
rs.''
``Why don't they move?'' Lex said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) rolled down he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
r window. ``Hey! Stupid dinosaur! Move!''
``Don't bother the animals, Lex,'' Ed Regis said.
``Why? It's stupid. They just sit there like a pictu
re in a book,<div class="bookquote">'' Lex said.
The voice was saying, '' (<font color='red'><b>monsters</b></font>)</div>-easygoing monsters from a b
ygone world stand in sharp contrast to
what we will see next. The most famous predator in
the history of the world: the mighty tyrant
lizard, known as Tyrannosaurus rex.''
``Good, Tyrannosaurus rex, '' Tim said.
``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)'s better than these bozos,'' Lex said, tu
rning away from the triceratops.
The Land Cruiser rumbled forward.
Big Rex
``The mighty tyrannosaurs arose late in dinosaur his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
tory. Dinosaurs ruled the earth for a hundred
and twenty million years, but there were tyrannosau
rs for only the last fifteen million years of that
period.''
The Land Cruisers had stopped at the rise of a hill
. They overlooked a forested area sloping
down to the edge of the lagoon. The sun was falling
to the west, sinking into a misty horizon. The
whole landscape of Jurassic Park was bathed in soft
light, with lengthening shadows. The
surface of the lagoon rippled in pink crescents. Fa
rther south, they saw the graceful necks of the
camarasaurs, standing at the water's edge, their bo
dies mirrored in the moving surface. It was
quiet, except for the soft drone of cicadas. As the
y stared out at that landscape, it was possible to
believe that they had really been transported milli
ons of years back in time to a vanished world.
``It works, doesn't it?'' they heard Ed Regis say, ov
er the intercom. ``I like to come here
sometimes, in the evening. And just sit.''
Grant was unimpressed. ``Where is T-rex?''
``Good question. You often see the little one down i
n the lagoon. The lagoon's stocked, so we
have fish in there. The little one has learned to c
atch the fish. Interesting how he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) does it. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
doesn't use his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hands, but he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ducks his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) whole head
under the water. Like a bird.''
``The little one?''
``The little T-rex. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s a juvenile, two years old,
and about a third grown now. Stands eight feet
high, weighs a ton and a half. The other one's a fu
ll-grown tyrannosaur. But I don't see him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at the
moment.''
``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s down hunting the camarasaurs,'' Grant sa
id.
Regis laughed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) voice tinny over the radio. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
would if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could, believe me. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
stands by the lagoon and stares at those animals, a
nd wiggles those little forearms of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in
frustration. But the T-rex territory is completely
enclosed with trenches and fences. They're
disguised from view, but believe me, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can't go an
ywhere.''
``Then where is he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''
``Hiding,'' Regis said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s a little shy.''
``Shy?'' Malcolm said. ``Tyrannosaurus rex is shy?''
``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) conceals himself as a general rule. You a
lmost never see him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) out in the open,
especially in daylight.''
``Why is that?''
``We think it's because he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has sensitive skin and su
nburns easily.''
Malcolm began to laugh.
Grant sighed. ``You're destroying a lot of illusions
.''
``I don't think you'll be disappointed,'' Regis said.
``Just wait.''
They heard a soft bleating sound. In the center of
a field, a small cage rose up into view, lifted
on hydraulics from underground. The cage bars slid
down, and the goat remained tethered in the
center of the field, bleating plaintively.
``Any minute now,'' Regis said again. They stared out
the window.
``Look at them,'' Hammond said, watching the control
room monitor. ``Leaning out of the windows,
so eager. They can't wait to see it. They have come
for the danger.''
``That's what I'm afraid of,'' Muldoon said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) twirl
ed the keys on his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) finger and watched the
Land Cruisers tensely. This was the first time that
visitors had toured Jurassic Park, and Muldoon
shared Arnold's apprehension.
Robert Muldoon was a big man, fifty years old, with
a steel-gray mustache and deep blue eyes.
Raised in Kenya, he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) had spent most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) life as a
guide for African big-game hunters, as had
his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) father before him (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>). But since 1980, he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) had worke
d principally for conservation groups and zoo
designers as a wildlife consultant. He (<font color='blue'><b>consultant</b></font>) had become w
ell known; an article in the London Sunday
Times had said, ``What Robert Trent Jones is to golf
courses, Robert Muldoon is to zoos: a
designer of unsurpassed knowledge and skill.''
In 1986, he (<font color='blue'><b>consultant</b></font>) had done some work for a San Francisco
company that was building a private
wildlife park on an island in North America. Muldoo
n had laid out the boundaries for different
animals, defining space and habitat requirements fo
r lions, elephants, zebras, and hippos.
Identifying which animals could be kept together, a
nd which had to be separated. At the time, it
had been a fairly routine job. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had been more int
erested in an Indian park called TigerWorld in
southern Kashmir.
Then, a year ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) was offered a job as game ward
en of Jurassic Park. It coincided with a
desire to leave Africa; the salary was excellent; M
uldoon had taken it on for a year. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) was
astonished to discover the park was really a collec
tion of genetically engineered prehistoric
animals.
It was of course interesting work, but during his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) y
ears in Africa, Muldoon had developed an
unblinking view of animals-an unromantic view-that
frequently set him (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) at odds with the Jurassic
Park management in California, particularly the lit
tle martinet standing beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) in the control
room. In Muldoon's opinion, cloning dinosaurs in a
laboratory was one thing. Maintaining them in
the wild was quite another.
It was Muldoon's view that some dinosaurs were too
dangerous to be kept in a park setting. In
part, the danger existed because they still knew so
little about the animals. For example, nobody
even suspected the dilophosaurs were poisonous unti
l they were observed hunting indigenous
rats on the island-biting the rodents and then step
ping back, to wait for them to die. And even
then nobody suspected the dilophosaurs could spit u
ntil one of the handlers was almost blinded
by spitting venom.
After that, Hammond had agreed to study dilophosaur
venom, which was found to contain
seven different toxic enzymes. It was also discover
ed that the dilophosaurs could spit a distance
of fifty feet. Since this raised the possibility th
at a guest in a car might be blinded, management
decided to remove the poison sacs. The vets had tri
ed twice, on two different animals, without
success, No one knew where the poison was being sec
reted. And no one would ever know until
an autopsy was performed on a dilophosaur and manag
ement would not allow one to be killed.
Muldoon worried even more about the velociraptors.
They were instinctive hunters, and they
never passed up prey, They killed even when they 't
weren't hungry. They killed for the pleasure of
killing. They were swift: strong runners and astoni
shing jumpers. They had lethal claws on all four
limbs; one swipe of a forearm would disembowel a ma
n, spilling his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) guts out. And they had
powerful tearing jaws that ripped flesh instead of
biting it. They were far more intelligent than the
other dinosaurs, and they seemed to be natural cage
-breakers.
Every zoo expert knew that certain animals were esp
ecially likely to get free of their cages.
Some, like monkeys and elephants, could undo cage d
oors. Others, like wild pigs, were
unusually intelligent and could lift gate fasteners
with their snouts. But who would suspect that
the giant armadillo was a notorious cage-breaker? O
r the moose? Yet a moose was almost as
skillful with its snout as an elephant with its tru
nk. Moose were always getting free; they had a
talent for it.
And so did velociraptors.
Raptors were at least as intelligent as chimpanzees
. And, like chimpanzees, they had agile
hands that enabled them to open doors and manipulat
e objects. They could escape with ease.
And when, as Muldoon had feared, one of them finall
y escaped, it killed two construction workers
and maimed a third before being recaptured. After t
hat episode, the visitor lodge had been
reworked with heavy barred gates, a high perimeter
fence, and tempered-glass windows. And the
raptor holding pen was rebuilt with electronic sens
ors to warn of another impending escape.
Muldoon wanted guns as well. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) wanted shoulder
-mounted TOW-missile launchers.
Hunters knew how difficult it was to bring down a f
our-ton African elephant-and some of the
dinosaurs weighed ten times as much. Management was
horrified, insisting there be no guns
anywhere on the island. When Muldoon threatened to
quit, and to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) story to the press, a
compromise was reached. In the end, two specially b
uilt laser-guided missile launchers were kept in
a locked room in the basement. Only Muldoon had key
s to the room.
Those were the keys Muldoon was twirling now. ``I'm
going downstairs,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said.
Arnold, watching the control screens, nodded. The t
wo Land Cruisers sat at the top of the hill,
waiting for the T-rex to appear.
``Hey,<div class="bookquote">'' Dennis Nedry called, from the far console. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>As long as you're up, get me a Coke, okay?''
Grant waited in the car, watching quietly. The blea
ting of the goat became louder, more insistent.
The goat tugged frantically at its tether, racing b
ack and forth. Over the radio, Grant heard Lex
say in alarm, ``What's going to happen to the goat?
Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) going to eat the goat?''
``I think so,'' someone said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), and then Ellie t
urned the radio down. Then they smelled the
odor, a garbage stench of putrefaction and decay th
at drifted up the hillside toward them.
Grant whispered, ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>)'s here.'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>),''

 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div><p/>Malcolm said.
The goat was tethered in the center of the field, t
hirty yards from the nearest trees. The
dinosaur must be somewhere among the trees, but for
a moment Grant could see nothing at all.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was looking too low: the animal
's head stood twenty feet above the ground,
half concealed among the upper branches of the palm
trees.
Malcolm whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my God... . She (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>)'s as larg
e as a bloody building...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Grant stared at the enormous square head, five feet
long, mottled reddish brown, with huge
jaws and fangs. The tyrannosaur's jaws worked once,
opening and closing. But the huge animal
did not emerge from hiding.
Malcolm whispered: <div class="bookquote">``How long will it wait?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe three or four minutes. Maybe-''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The tyrannosaur sprang silently forward, fully reve
aling her (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) enormous body. In four bounding
steps she (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) covered the distance to the goat, bent do
wn, and bit it through the neck. The bleating
stopped. There was silence.
Poised over her (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) kill, the tyrannosaur became sudden
ly hesitant. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) massive head turned on
the muscular neck, looking in all directions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) s
tared fixedly at the Land Cruiser, high above on
the hill.
Malcolm whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Can she (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) see us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Regis said, on the intercom. <div class="bookquote">``Let's see i
f she (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>)'s going to eat here in front of us, or if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>)'s going to drag the prey away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The tyrannosaur bent down, and sniffed the carcass
of the goat. A bird chirped: her (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) head
snapped up, alert, watchful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) looked back and fo
rth, scanning in small jerking shifts.
<div class="bookquote">``Like a bird,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said.
Still the tyrannosaur hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``What is she (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>) afrai
d of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm whispered.
<div class="bookquote">``Probably another tyrannosaur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant whispered. Bi
g carnivores like lions and tigers often
became cautious after a kill, behaving as if sudden
ly exposed. Nineteenth-century zoologists
imagined the animals felt guilty for what they had
done. But contemporary scientists documented
the effort behind a kill-hours of patient stalking
before the final lunge-as well as the frequency of
failure. The idea of <div class="bookquote">``nature, red in tooth and claw
''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was wrong; most often the prey got away.
When a carnivore finally brought down an animal, it
was watchful for another predator, who might
attack it and steal its prize. Thus this tyrannosau
r was probably fearful of another tyrannosaur.
The huge animal bent over the goat again. One great
hind limb held the carcass in place as
the jaws began to tear the flesh.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Trent</b></font>)'s going to stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Regis whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Excellent.
''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The tyrannosaur lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) head again,
ragged chunks of bleeding flesh in her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) jaws. She (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) st
ared at the Land Cruiser. She (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) began to chew.
They heard the sickening crunch of bones.
<div class="bookquote">``Ewww,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, over the intercom. <div class="bookquote">``That's disgus
ting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>And then, as if caution had finally gotten the bett
er of her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>), the tyrannosaur lifted the remains of
the goat in her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) jaws and carried it silently back a
mong the trees.
<div class="bookquote">``Ladies and gentlemen, Tyrannosaurus rex, ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the tap
e said. The Land Cruisers started up, and
moved silently off, through the foliage.
Malcolm sat back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) seat. <div class="bookquote">``Fantastic,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) said.

<p/>Gennaro wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) forehead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) looked pale.
Control
Henry Wu came into the control room to find everyon
e sitting in the dark, listening to the voices
on the radio.
<div class="bookquote">''-Jesus, if an animal like that gets out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Gennaro
was saying, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) voice tinny on the speaker,
<div class="bookquote">``there'd be no stopping it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No stopping it, no ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Huge, with no natural enemies ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My God, think of it ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>In the control room, Hammond said, <div class="bookquote">``Damn those peop
le. They are so negative.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Wu said, <div class="bookquote">``They're still going on about an animal es
caping? I don't understand. They must have
seen by now that we have everything under control.
We've engineered the animals and
engineered the resort...''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) shrugged.
It was Wu's deepest perception that the park was fu
ndamentally sound, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) believed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>)
paleo-DNA was fundamentally sound. Whatever problem
s might arise in the DNA were
essentially point-problems in the code, causing a s
pecific problem in the phenotype: an enzyme
that didn't switch on, or a protein that didn't fol
d. Whatever the difficulty, it was always solved wi
th a
relatively minor adjustment in the next version.
Similarly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) knew that Jurassic Park's problems we
re not fundamental problems. They were
not control problems. Nothing as basic, or as serio
us, as the possibility of an animal escaping.
Wu found it offensive to think that anyone would be
lieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) capable of contributing to a system
where such a thing could happen.
<div class="bookquote">``It's that Malcolm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said darkly. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>)'s beh
ind it all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) was against us from the start,
you know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>)'s got his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) theory that complex systems
can't be controlled and nature can't be
imitated. I don't know what his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) problem is. Hell, w
e're just making a zoo here. World's full of 'em,
and they all work fine. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>)'s going to prove his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>)
theory or die trying. I just hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) doesn't panic

<p/>Gennaro into trying to shut the park down.''
Wu said, ``Can he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) do that?''
``No,'' Hammond said. ``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) can try. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) can try and
frighten the Japanese investors, and get
them to withdraw funds. Or he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) can make a stink with
the San Jos government. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jos</b></font>) can make
trouble.''
Arnold stubbed out his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) cigarette. ``Let's wait and s
ee what happens,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) said. ``We believe in
the park. Let's see how it plays out.''
Muldoon got off the elevator, nodded to the ground-
floor guard, and went downstairs to the
basement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) flicked on the lights. The basement wa
s filled with two dozen Land Cruisers,
arranged in neat rows. These were the electric cars
that would eventually form an endless loop,
touring the park, returning to the visitor center.
In the corner was a Jeep with a red stripe, one of
two gasoline-powered vebicles-Harding, the
vet, had taken the other that morning-which could g
o anywhere in the park, even among the
animals. The Jeeps were painted with a diagonal red
stripe because for some reason it
discouraged the triceratops from charging the car.
Muldoon moved past the Jeep, toward the back. The s
teel door to the armaments room was
unmarked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) unlocked it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) key, and swung th
e heavy door wide. Gun racks lined the
interior. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) pulled out a Randler Shoulder Launcher
and a case of canisters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) tucked two gray
rockets under his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) other arm.
After locking the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) put the gun i
nto the back seat of the Jeep. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) left the
garage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) heard the distant rumble of thunder.
``Looks like rain,'' Ed Regis said, glancing up at th
e sky.
The Land Cruisers had stopped again, near the sauro
pod swamp. A large herd of apatosaurs
was grazing at the edge of the lagoon, eating the l
eaves of the upper branches of the palm trees.
In the same area were several duckbilled hadrosaurs
, which in comparison looked much smaller.
Of course, Tim knew the hadrosaurs weren't really s
mall. It was only that the apatosaurs were
so much larger. Their tiny heads reached fifty feet
into the air, extending out on their long necks.
``The big animals you see are commonly called Bronto
saurus, '' the recording said, ``but they
are actually Apatosaurus. They weigh more than thir
ty tons. That means a single animal is as big
as a whole herd of modern elephants. And you may no
tice that their preferred area, alongside the
lagoon, is not swampy. Despite what the books say,
brontosaurs avoid swamps. They prefer dry
land.''
``Brontosaurus is the biggest dinosaur, Lex,'' Ed Reg
is said. Tim didn't bother to contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>).
Actually, Brachiosaurus was three times as large. A
nd some people thought Ultrasaurus and
Seismosaurus were even larger than Brachiosaurus. S
eismosaurus might have weighed a
hundred tons!
Alongside the apatosaurs, the smaller hadrosaurs st
ood on their hind legs to get at foliage.
They moved gracefully for such large creatures. Sev
eral infant hadrosaurs scampered around the
adults, eating the leaves that dropped from the mou
ths of the larger animals.
``The dinosaurs of Jurassic Park don't breed,'' the r
ecording said. ``The young animals you see
were introduced a few months ago, already hatched.
But the adults nurture them anyway.''
There was the rolling growl of thunder. The sky was
darker, lower, and menacing.
``Yeah, looks like rain, all right,'' Ed Regis said.
The car started forward, and Tim looked back at the
hadrosaurs. Suddenly, off to one side, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
saw a pale yellow animal moving quickly. There were
brownish stripes on its back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) recognized
it instantly. ``Hey!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) shouted. ``Stop the car!<div class="bookquote">''
:`What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed Regis said.
`Quick! Stop the car!''
``We move on now to see the last of our great prehis
toric animals, the stegosaurs,'' the
recorded voice said.
``What's the matter, Tim?''
``I saw one! I saw one in the field out there!''
``Saw what?''
``A raptor! In that field!''
``The stegosaurs are a mid-Jurassic animal, evolving
about a hundred and seventy million
years ago,'' the recording said. ``Several of these r
emarkable herbivores live here at Jurassic
Park-''
``Oh, I don't think so, Tim,'' Ed Regis said. ``Not a
raptor.''
``I did! Stop the car!''
There was a babble on the intercom, as the news was
relayed to Grant and Malcolm. ``Tim
says he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw a raptor.''
``Where?''
``Back at the field.''
``Let's go back and look.''
``We can't go back,'' Ed Regis said. ``We can only go
forward. The cars are programmed.''
``We can't go back?'' Grant said.
``No,'' Regis said. ``Sorry, You see, it's kind of a r
ide-''
``Tim, this is Professor Malcolm,'' said a voice cutt
ing in on the intercom. ``I have just one
question for you about this raptor. How old would y
ou say it was?''
``Older than the baby we saw today,'' Tim said. ``And
younger than the big adults in the pen.
The adults were six feet tall. This one was about h
alf that size.''
``That's fine,'' Malcolm said.
``I only saw it for a second,'' Tim said.
``I'm sure it wasn't a raptor,'' Ed Regis said. ``It c
ouldn't possibly be a raptor. Must have been
one of the othys. They're always jumping their fenc
es. We have a hell of a time with them.''
``I know I saw a raptor,'' Tim said.
``I'm hungry,'' Lex said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) was starting to whine.
In the control room, Arnold turned to Wu. ``What do
you think the kid saw?''
``I think it must have been an otby.''
Arnold nodded. ``We have trouble tracking otbys, bec
ause they spend so much time In the
trees.'' The otbys were an exception to the usual mi
nute-to-minute control they maintained over
the animals. The computers were constantly losing a
nd picking up the othys, as they went into
the trees and then came down again.
``What burns me,'' Hammond said, ``is that we have mad
e this wonderful park, this fantastic
park, and our very first visitors are going through
it like accountants, just looking for problems.
They aren't experiencing the wonder of it at all.''
``That's their problem,'' Arnold said. ``We can't make
them experience wonder.'' The intercom
clicked, and Arnold heard a voice drawl, ``Ah, John,
this is the Anne B over at the dock. We
haven't finished offloading, but I'm looking at tha
t storm pattern south of us. I'd rather not be tied

<p/>up here if this chop gets any worse.''
Arnold turned to the monitor showing the cargo vess
el, which was moored at the dock on the
east side of the island. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) pressed the radio butto
n. ``How much left to do, Jim?''
``Just the three final equipment containers. I haven
't checked the mainfest, but I assume you
can wait another two weeks for it. We're not well b
erthed here, you know, and we are one
hundred miles offshore.''
``You requesting permission to leave?''
``Yes, John.''
``I want that equipment,'' Hammond said. ``That's equi
pment for the labs. We need it.''
``Yes,'' Arnold said. ``But you didn't want to put mon
ey into a storm barrier to protect the pier. So
we don't have a good harbor. If the storm gets wors
e, the ship will be pounded against the dock.
I've seen ships lost that way. Then you've got all
the other expenses, replacement of the vessel
plus salvage to clear your dock ... and you can't
use your dock until you do...''
Hammond gave a dismissing wave. ``Get them out of th
ere.''
``Permission to leave, Anne B, '' Arnold said, into t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) radio.
``See you in two weeks,'' the voice said.
On the video monitor, they saw the crew on the deck
s, casting off the lines. Arnold turned back
to the main console bank. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) saw the Land Cruisers
moving through fields of steam.
``Where are they now?'' Hammond said.
``It looks like the south fields,'' Arnold said. The
southern end of the island had more volcanic
activity than the north. ``That means they should be
almost to the stegos. I'm sure they'll stop and
see what Harding is doing.''
Stegosaur
As the Land Cruiser came to a stop, Ellie Sattler s
tared through the plumes of steam at the
stegosaurus. It was standing quietly, not moving. A
Jeep with a red stripe was parked alongside it.
``I have to admit, that's a funny-looking animal,'' M
alcolm said.
The stegosaurus was twenty feet long, with a huge b
ulky body and vertical armor plates along
its back. The tail had dangerous-looking three-foot
spikes. But the neck tapered to an absurdly
small head with a stupid gaze, like a very dumb hor
se.
As they watched, a man walked around from behind th
e animal. ``That's our vet, Dr. Harding,''
Regis said, over the radio. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)'s anesthetized the
stego, which is why it's not moving. It's sick.''
Grant was already getting out of the car, hurrying
toward the motionless stegosaur. Ellie got
out and looked back as the second Land Cruiser pull
ed up and the two kids jumped out. ``What's
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) sick with?'' Tim said.
``They're not sure,'' Ellie said.
The great leathery plates along the stegosaur's spi
ne drooped slightly. It breathed slowly,
laboriously, making a wet sound with each breath.
``Is it contagious?'' Lex said.
They walked toward the tiny head of the animal, whe
re Grant and the vet were on their knees,
peering into the stegosaur's mouth.
Lex wrinkled her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) nose. ``This thing sure is big,'' sh
e said. ``And smelly.''
``Yes, it is.'' Ellie had already noticed the stegosa
ur had a peculiar odor, like rotting fish. It
reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) of something she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) knew, but couldn't qu
ite place. In any case, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) had never
smelled a stegosaur before. Maybe this was its char
acteristic odor. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) doubts. Most
herbivores did not have a strong smell. Nor did the
ir droppings. It was reserved for the meat-
eaters to develop a real stink.
``Is that because it's sick?'' Lex asked.
``Maybe. And don't forget the vet's tranquilized it.
''
``Ellie, have a look at this tongue,'' Grant said.
The dark purple tongue drooped limply from the anim
al's mouth. The vet shone a light on it so
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) could see the very fine silvery blisters. ``Micr
ovesicles,'' Ellie said. ``Interesting.''
``We've had a difficult time with these stegos,'' the
vet said. ``They're always getting sick.''
``What are the symptoms?'' Ellie asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) scratched
the tongue with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) fingernail. A clear
liquid exuded from the broken blisters.
``Ugh,'' Lex said,
``Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing, and
massive diarrhea,'' Harding said. ``Seems to
happen about once every six weeks or so.''
``They feed continuously?''
``Oh yes,'' Harding said. ``Animal this size has to ta
ke in a minimum of five or six hundred
pounds of plant matter daily just to keep going. Th
ey're constant foragers.''
``Then it's not likely to be poisoning from a plant,
'' Ellie said. Constant browsers would be
constantly sick if they were eating a toxic plant.
Not every six weeks.
``Exactly,'' the vet said.
``May I?'' Ellie asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) took the flashlight from
the vet. ``You have pupillary effects from the
tranquilizer?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said, shining the light in the s
tegosaur's eye.
``Yes. There's a miotic effect, pupils are constrict
ed.'' ``But
these pupils are dilated,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said.
Harding looked. There was no question: the stegosau
r's pupil was dilated, and did not contract
when light shone on it. ``I'll be damned,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) said.
``That's a pharmacological effect.''
``Yes.'' Ellie got back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) feet and looked around
. ``What is the animal's range?''
``About five square miles.''
``In this general area?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) asked. They were in an
open meadow, with scattered rocky
outcrops, and intermittent plumes of steam rising f
rom the ground. It was late afternoon, and the
sky was pink beneath the lowering gray clouds.
``Their range is mostly north and cast of here,'' Har
ding said. ``But when they get sick, they're
usually somewhere around this particular area.''
It was an interesting puzzle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) thought. How to e
xplain the periodicity of the poisoning? She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
pointed across the field. ``You see those low, delic
ate-looking bushes?''
``West Indian lilac.'' Harding nodded. ``We know it's
toxic. The animals don't eat it.''
``You're sure?''
``Yes. We monitor them on video, and I've checked dr
oppings just to be certain. The stegos
never eat the lilac bushes.''
Melia azedarach, called chinaberry or West Indian l
ilac, contained a number of toxic alkaloids.
The Chinese used the plant as a fish poison.
``They don't eat it,'' the vet said.
``Interesting,'' Ellie said. ``Because otherwise I wou
ld have said that this animal shows all the
classic signs of Melia toxicity: stupor, blistering
of the mucous membranes, and pupillary
dilatation.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) set off toward the field to examin
e the plants more closely, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) body bent over the
ground. ``You're right,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said. ``Plants are healt
hy, no sign of being eaten. None at all.''
``And there's the six-week interval,'' the vet remind
ed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>).
``The stegosaurs come here how often?''
``About once a week,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>vet</b></font>) said. ``Stegos make a slow l
oop through their home-range territory,
feeding as they go. They complete the loop in about
a week.''
<div class="bookquote">``But they're only sick once every six weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Correct,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Harding said.
<div class="bookquote">``This is boring,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``Ssshb,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said. <div class="bookquote">``Dr. Sattler's trying to think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unsuccessfully,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said, walking farther out i
nto the field.
Behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) heard Lex saying, <div class="bookquote">``Anybody want to
play a little pickle?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Ellie stared at the ground. The field was rocky in
many places. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) could hear the sound of the
surf, somewhere to the left. There were berries amo
ng the rocks. Perhaps the animals were just
eating berries. But that didn't make sense. West In
dian lilac berries were terribly bitter.
<div class="bookquote">``Finding anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said, coming up to join h
er.
Ellie sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Just rocks,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We must be n
ear the beach, because all these rocks are
smooth. And they're in funny little piles.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Funny little piles?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
<div class="bookquote">``All over. There's one pile right there.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) point
ed.
As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) realized what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was looki
ng at. The rocks were worn, but it had
nothing to do with the ocean. These rocks were heap
ed in small piles, almost as if they had been
thrown down that way.
They were piles of gizzard stones.
Many birds and crocodiles swallowed small stones, w
hich collected in a muscular pouch in the
digestive tract, called the gizzard. Squeezed by th
e muscles of the gizzard, the stones helped
crush tough plant food before it reached the stomac
h, and thus aided digestion. Some scientists
thought dinosaurs also had gizzard stones. For one
thing, dinosaur teeth were too small, and too
little worn, to have been used for chewing food. It
was presumed that dinosaurs swallowed their
food whole and let the gizzard stones break down th
e plant fibers. And some skeletons had been
found with an associated pile of small stones in th
e abdominal area. But it had never been
verified, and-
<div class="bookquote">``Gizzard stones,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
<div class="bookquote">``I think so, yes. They swallow these stones, and af
ter a few weeks the stones are worn
smooth, so they regurgitate them, leaving this litt
le pile, and swallow fresh stones. And when they
do, they swallow berries as well. And get sick.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll be damned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you're righ
t.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) looked at the pile of stones, brushing through t
hem with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) band, following the instinct of a
paleontologist.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) stopped.
<div class="bookquote">``Ellie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Take a look at this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Put it there, babe! Right in the old mitt!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex cr
ied, and Gennaro threw the ball to her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) threw it back so hard that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) hand stung. <div class="bookquote">``Tak

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You wimp!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) said contemptuously.
Annoyed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) fired the ball at her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), and heard it sma
ck! in the leather. <div class="bookquote">``Now that's more like it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) said.
Standing by the dinosaur, Gennaro continued to play
catch as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) talked to Malcolm. <div class="bookquote">``How
does this sick dinosaur fit into your theory?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's predicted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said.
Gennaro shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Is anything not predicted
by your theory?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said. ``It's nothing to do with me.
It's chaos theory. But I notice nobody is
willing to listen to the consequences of the mathem
atics. Because they imply very large
consequences for human life. Much larger than Heise
nberg's principle or G``del's theorem, which
everybody rattles on about. Those are actually rath
er academic considerations. Philosophical
considerations. But chaos theory concerns everyday
life. Do you know why computers were first
built?''
``No,'' Gennaro said.
``Burn it in there,'' Lex yelled. ``Computers were bui
lt in the late 1940s because mathematicians
like John von Neumann thought that if you had a com
puter-a machine to handle a lot of variables
simultaneously-you would be able to predict the wea
ther. Weather would finally fall to human
understanding. And men believed that dream for the
next forty years. They believed that
prediction was just a function of keeping track of
things. If you knew enough, you could predict
anything. That's been a cherished scientific belief
since Newton.''
``And?''
``Chaos theory throws it right out the window. It sa
ys that you can never predict certain
phenomena at all. You can never predict the weather
more than a few days away. All the money
that has been spent on long-range forecasting-about
half a billion dollars in the last few decades-
is money wasted. It's a fool's errand. It's as poin
tless as trying to turn lead into gold. We look
back at the alchemists and laugh at what they were
trying to do, but future generations will laugh at
us the same way. We've tried the impossible-and spe
nt a lot of money doing it. Because in fact
there are great categories of phenomena that are in
herently unpredictable.''
``Chaos says that?''
``Yes, and it is astonishing how few people care to
hear it,'' Malcolm said. ``I gave all this
information to Hammond long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) broke ground
on this place. You're going to engineer a
bunch of prehistoric animals and set them on an isl
and? Fine. A lovely dream. Charming. But it
won't go as planned. It is inherently unpredictable
, just as the weather is.''
``You told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) this?'' Gennaro said.
``Yes. I also told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) where the deviations would oc
cur. Obviously the fitness of the animals to
the environment was one area. This stegosaur is a h
undred million years old. It isn't adapted to
our world. The air is different, the solar radiatio
n is different, the land is different, the insects
are
different, the sounds are different, the vegetation
is different. Everything is different. The oxygen
content is decreased. This poor animal's like a hum
an being at ten thousand feet altitude. Listen
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) wheezing.''
``And the other areas?''
``Broadly speaking, the ability of the park to contr
ol the spread of life forms. Because the history
of evolution is that life escapes all barriers. Lif
e breaks free. Life expands to new territories.
Painfully, perhaps even dangerously. But life finds
a way.'' Malcolm shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) head. ``I don't mean
to be philosophical, but there it is.''
Gennaro looked over. Ellie and Grant were across th
e field, waving their arms and shouting.
``Did you get my Coke?<div class="bookquote">'' Dennis Nedry asked, as Muldo
on came back into the control room.
Muldoon didn't bother to answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) went directly t
o the monitor and looked at what was
happening. Over the radio he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) heard Harding's voice
saying, '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-the stego-finally-handle on-now-''
``What's that about?'' Muldoon said.
``They're down by the south point,'' Arnold said. ``Th
at's why they're breaking up a little. I'll
switch them to another channel. But they found out
what's wrong with the stegos. Eating some
kind of berry.''
Hammond nodded. ``I knew we'd solve that sooner or l
ater,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) said.
``It's not very impressive,'' Gennaro said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) held t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) white fragment, no larger than a postage
stamp, up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) fingertip in the fading light. ``Yo
u sure about this, Alan?''
``Absolutely sure,'' Grant said. ``What gives it away
is the patterning on the interior surface, the
interior curve. Turn it over and you will notice a
faint pattern of raised lines, making roughly
triangular shapes.''
``Yes, I see them.''
``Well, I've dug out two eggs with patterns like tha
t at my site in Montana.''
``You're saying this is a piece of dinosaur eggshell
?''
``Absolutely,'' Grant said.
Harding shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head. ``These dinosaurs can't bree
d.''
``Evidently they can,'' Gennaro said.
``That must be a bird egg,'' Harding said. ``We have l
iterally dozens of species on the island.''
Grant shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head. ``Look at the curvature. The s
hell is almost flat. That's from a very big
egg. And notice the thickness of the shell. Unless
you have ostriches on this island, it's a
dinosaur egg.''
``But they can't possibly breed,'' Harding insisted.
``All the animals are female.''
``All I know,'' Grant said, ``is that this is a dinosa
ur egg.''
Malcolm said, ``Can you tell the species?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''

``But they're all female,'' Wu said. ``It's impossible
. There must be a mistake. And look at the
numbers. A small increase in the big animals, the m
aiasaurs and the hypsys. And big increases
in the number of small animals. It just doesn't mak
e sense. It must be a mistake.''
The radio clicked. ``Actually not,'' Grant said. ``I t
hink these numbers confirm that breeding is
taking place. In seven different sites around the i
sland.''
Breeding Sites
The sky was growing darker. Thunder rumbled in the
distance. Grant and the others leaned in the
doors of the Jeep, staring at the screen on the das
hboard. ``Breeding sites?'' Wu said, over the
radio.
``Nests,'' Grant said. ``Assuming the average clutch i
s eight to twelve hatching eggs, these data
would indicate the compys have two nests. The rapto
rs have two nests. The othys have one nest.
And the hypsys and the maias have one nest each.''
``Where are these nests?''
``We'll have to find them,'' Grant said. ``Dinosaurs b
uild their nests in secluded places.''
``But why are there so few big animals?'' Wu said. ``I
f there is a maia nest of eight to twelve
eggs, there should be eight to twelve new maias. No
t just one.''
``That's right,'' Grant said. ``Except that the raptor
s and the compys that are loose in the park
are probably eating the eggs of the bigger animals
and perhaps eating the newly hatched young,
as well.''
``But we've never seen that,'' Arnold said, over the
radio.
``Raptors are nocturnal,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said. ``Is anyone watchi
ng the park at night?''
There was a long silence.
``I didn't think so,'' Grant said.
``It still doesn't make sense,'' Wu said. ``You can't
support fifty additional animals on a couple of
nests of eggs.''
``No,'' Grant said. ``I assume they are eating somethi
ng else as well. Perhaps small rodents.
Mice and rats?''
There was another silence.
``Let me guess,'' Grant said. ``When you first came to
the island, you had a problem with rats.
But as time passed, the problem faded away.''
``Yes. That's true... ''
``And you never thought to investigate why.'' ``Well,

<p/>we just assumed ...'' Arnold said.
``Look,'' Wu said, ``the fact remains, all the animals
are female. They can't breed.''
Grant had been thinking about that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had recently
learned of an intriguing West German
study that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) suspected held the answer. ``When you
made your dinosaur DNA,'' Grant said, ``you
were working with fragmentary pieces, is that right
?''
``Yes,'' Wu said.
``In order to make a complete strand, we're you ever
required to include DNA fragments from
other species?''
``Occasionally, yes,'' Wu said. ``It's the only way to
accomplish the job. Sometimes we included
avian DNA, from a variety of birds, and sometimes r
eptilian DNA.''
``Any amphibian DNA? Specifically, frog DNA?''
``Possibly. I'd have to check.''
``Check,'' Grant said. ``I think you'll find that hold
s the answer.''
Malcolm said, ``Frog DNA? Why frog DNA?''
Gennaro said impatiently, ``Listen, this is all very
intriguing, but we're forgetting the main
question: have any animals gotten off the island?''
Grant said, ``We can't tell from these data.''
``Then how are we going to find out?''
``There's only one way I know,'' Grant said. ``We'll h
ave to find the individual dinosaur nests,
inspect them, and count the remaining egg fragments
. From that we may be able to determine
how many animals were originally hatched. And we ca
n begin to assess whether any are
missing.''
Malcolm said, ``Even so, you won't know if the missi
ng animals are killed, or dead from natural
causes, or whether they have left the island.''
``No,'' Grant said, ``but it's a start. And I think we
can get more information from an intensive
look at the population graphs.''
``How are we going to find these nests?''
``Actually,'' Grant said, ``I think the computer will
be able to help us with that.''
``Can we go back now?'' Lex said. ``I'm hungry.''
``Yes, let's go,'' Grant said, smiling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). ``You'v
e been very patient.''
``You'll be able to eat in about twenty minutes,'' Ed
Regis said, starting toward the two Land
Cruisers.
``I'll stay for a while,'' Ellie said, ``and get photo
s of the stego with Dr. Harding's camera. Those
vesicles in the mouth will have cleared up by tomor
row.''
``I want to get back,'' Grant said. ``I'll go with the
kids.'' ``I
will, too,'' Malcolm said.
``I think I'll stay,'' Gennaro said, ``and go back wit
h Harding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) Jeep, with Dr. Sattler.''
``Fine, let's go.''
They started walking. Malcolm said, ``Why exactly is
our lawyer staying?''
Grant shrugged. ``I think it might have something to
do with Dr. Sattler.''
``Really? The shorts, you think?''
``It's happened before,'' Grant said.
When they came to the Land Cruisers, Tim said, ``I w
ant to ride in the front one this time, with
Dr. Grant.''
Malcolm said, ``Unfortunately, Dr. Grant and I need
to talk.'' ``I'll
just sit and listen. I won't say anything,'' Tim sai
d. ``It's a private
conversation,'' Malcolm said.
``Tell you what, Tim,'' Ed Regis said. ``Let them sit
in the rear car by themselves. We'll sit in the
front car, and you can use the night-vision goggles
. Have you ever used night-vision goggles,
Tim? They're goggles with very sensitive CCDs that
allow you to see in the dark.''
``Neat,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) said, and moved toward the first car.
``Hey!'' Lex said. ``I want to use it, too.'' <div class="bookquote">``No,''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div><p/>Tim said.
<div class="bookquote">``No fair! No fair! You get to do everything, Timmy!
''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed Regis watched them go and said to Grant, <div class="bookquote">``I can

 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant and Malcolm climbed into the second car. A fe

A red light on the dashboard blinked. With a soft e

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do mathematicians believe in intuition?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Absolutely. Very important, intuition. Actually, I
was thinking of fractals,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said. <div class="bookquote">``You
know about fractals?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Not really, no.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Fractals are a kind of geometry, associated with a
man named Mandelbrot. Unlike ordinary
Euclidean geometry that everybody learns in school-
squares and cubes and spheres-fractal
geometry appears to describe real objects in the na
tural world. Mountains and clouds are fractal
shapes. So fractals are probably related to reality
. Somehow.
``Well, Mandelbrot found a remarkable thing with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
geometric tools. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found that things
looked almost identical at different scales.''
``At different scales?'' Grant said.
``For example,'' Malcolm said, ``a big mountain, seen
from far away, has a certain rugged
mountain shape. If you get closer, and examine a sm
all peak of the big mountain, it will have the
same mountain shape. In fact, you can go all the wa
y down the scale to a tiny speck of rock,
seen under a microscope-it will have the same basic
fractal shape as the big mountain.''
``I don't really see why this is worrying you,'' Gran
t said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) yawned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) smelled the sulfur
fumes of the volcanic steam. They were coming now t
o the section of road that ran near the
coastline, overlooking the beach and the ocean.
``It's a way of looking at things,'' Malcolm said. ``M
andelbrot found a sameness from the
smallest to the largest. And this sameness of scale
also occurs for events.''
``Events?''
``Consider cotton prices,'' Malcolm said. ``There are
good records of cotton prices going back
more than a hundred years. When you study fluctuati
ons in cotton prices, you find that the graph of
price fluctuations in the course of a day looks bas
ically like the graph for a week, which looks
basically like the graph for a year, or for ten yea
rs. And that's how things are. A day is like a
whole life. You start out doing one thing, but end
up doing something else, plan to run an errand,
but never get there... . And at the end of your l
ife, your whole existence has that same
haphazard quality, too. Your whole life has the sam
e shape as a single day.''
``I guess it's one way to look at things,'' Grant sai
d.
``No,'' Malcolm said. ``It's the only way to look at t
hings. At least, the only way that is true to
reality. You see, the fractal idea of sameness carr
ies within it an aspect of recursion, a kind of
doubling back on itself, which means that events ar
e unpredictable. That they can change
suddenly, and without warning.''
``Okay ...''
``But we have soothed ourselves into imagining sudde
n change as something that happens
outside the normal order of things. An accident, li
ke a car crash. Or beyond our control, like a
fatal illness. We do not conceive of sudden, radica
l, irrational change as built into the very fabric
of existence. Yet it is. And chaos theory teaches u
s,'' Malcolm said, ``that straight linearity, which
we have come to take for granted in everything from
physics to fiction, simply does not exist.
Linearity is an artificial way of viewing the world
. Real life isn't a series of interconnected events

<p/>occurring one after another like beads strung on a
necklace. Life is actually a series of
encounters in which one event may change those that
follow in a wholly unpredictable, even
devastating way.'' Malcolm sat back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) seat, loo
king toward the other Land Cruiser, a few
yards ahead. ``That's a deep truth about the structu
re of our universe. But, for some reason, we
insist on behaving as if it were not true.''
At that moment, the cars jolted to a stop, ``What's
happened?'' Grant said.
Up ahead, they saw the kids in the car, pointing to
ward the ocean. Offshore, beneath lowering
clouds, Grant saw the dark outline of the supply bo
at making its way back toward Puntarenas.
``Why have we stopped?'' Malcolm said.
Grant turned on the radio and heard the girl saying
excitedly, ``Look there, Timmy! You see it,
it's there!''
Malcolm squinted at the boat. ``They talking about t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Timmy</b></font>) boat?''
``Apparently.''
Ed Regis climbed out of the front car and came runn
ing back to their window. ``I'm sorry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>)
said, ``but the kids are all worked up. Do you have
binoculars here?''
``For what?''
``The little girl says she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sees something on the boa
t. Some kind of animal,'' Regis said.
Grant grabbed the binoculars and rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) elbows
on the window ledge of the Land Cruiser. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
scanned the long shape of the supply ship. It was s
o dark it was almost a silhouette; as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
watched, the ship's running lights came on, brillia
nt in the dark purple twilight.
``Do you see anything?'' Regis said. <div class="bookquote">``No,''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div><p/>Grant said.
<div class="bookquote">``They're low down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, over the radio. <div class="bookquote">``Look
low down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant tilted the binoculars down, scanning the bull
just above the waterline. The supply ship
was broad-beamed, with a splash flange that ran the
length of the ship. But it was quite dark now,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could hardly make out details.
<div class="bookquote">``No, nothing ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can see them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``Near the b

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How can she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) see anything in this light?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm s
aid.
<div class="bookquote">``Kids can see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``They've got visual acu
ity we forgot we ever had.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) swung the binoculars toward the stern, moving th
em slowly, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw the
animals. They were playing, darting among the silho
uetted stern structures. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could see them
only briefly, but even in the fading light he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could
tell that they were upright animals, about two fee
t
tall, standing with stiff balancing tails.
<div class="bookquote">``You see them now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. ``I see

<p/>them,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) said.
``What are they?''
``They're raptors,'' Grant said, ``At least two. Maybe
more. Juveniles.''
``Jesus, '' Ed Regis said. ``That boat's going to the
mainland.''
Malcolm shrugged. ``Don't get excited. Just call the
control room and tell them to recall the
boat.''
Ed Regis reached in and grabbed the radio from the
dashboard. They heard hissing static, and
clicks as he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) rapidly changed channels. ``There's som
ething wrong with this one,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) said. ``It's not
working.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) ran off to the first Land Cruiser. They saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>)
duck into it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) looked back at them.
``There's something wrong with both the radios,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>)
said. ``I can't raise the control room.''
``Then let's get going,'' Grant said.
In the control room, Muldoon stood before the big w
indows that overlooked the park. At seven
o'clock, the quartz floodlights came on all over th
e island, turning the landscape into a glowing
jewel stretching away to the south. This was his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) fa
vorite moment of the day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) heard the crackle of
static from the radios.
``The Land Cruisers have started again,'' Arnold said
. ``They're on their way home.''
``But why did they stop?'' Hammond said. ``And why can
't we talk to them?''
``I don't know,'' Arnold said. ``Maybe they turned off
the radios in the cars.
<div class="bookquote">``Probably the storm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``Interference f

 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold picked up the phone and heard a steady monot

At night, the whole road was illuminated by big flo
odlights. It felt to Grant as if they were driving
through a bright green tunnel of leaves. Large rain
drops spattered the windshield.
Grant felt the Land Cruiser slow, then stop. <div class="bookquote">``Now w
hat?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to stop. Why did we stop?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>And then, suddenly, all the floodlights went out. T

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, but only power on the perimeter. Everything

gone black.
<div class="bookquote">``What about the two Land Cruisers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said, ``call Maintenance and let's g

Arnold picked up one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) phones and heard hissin
g: Nedry's computers talking to each
other. ``No phones. That damn Nedry. Nedry! Where th
e hell is he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)?''
Dennis Nedry pushed open the door marked FERTILIZAT
ION, With the perimeter power out, all
the security-card locks were disarmed. Every door i
n the building opened with a touch.
The problems with the security system were high on
Jurassic Park's bug list. Nedry wondered
if anybody ever imagined that it wasn't a bug-tbat
Nedry had programmed it that way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) had
built in a classic trap door. Few programmers of la
rge computer systems could resist the
temptation to leave themselves a secret entrance. P
artly it was common sense: if inept users
locked up the system-and then called you for help-y
ou always had a way to get in and repair the
mess. And partly it was a kind of signature: Kilroy
was here.
And partly it was insurance for the future. Nedry w
as annoyed with the Jurassic Park project;
late in the schedule, InGen had demanded extensive
modifications to the system but hadn't been
willing to pay for them, arguing they should be inc
luded under the original contract. Lawsuits were
threatened; letters were written to Nedry's other c
lients, implying that Nedry was unreliable. It was
blackmail, and in the end Nedry had been forced to
eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) overages on Jurassic Park and to
make the changes that Hammond wanted.
But later, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was approached by Lewis Dodgson
at Biosyn, Nedry was ready to listen.
And able to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) could indeed get past Juras
sic Park security. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) could get into any room,
any system, anywhere in the park. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) had pr
ogrammed it that way. Just in case.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) entered the fertilization room. The lab was dese
rted; as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) had anticipated, all the staff was
at dinner. Nedry unzipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) shoulder bag and remo
ved the can of Gillette shaving cream. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)
unscrewed the base, and saw the interior was divide
d into a series of cylindrical slots.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) pulled on a pair of heavy insulated gloves and o
pened the walk-in freezer marked
CONTENTS VIABLE BIOLOGICAL MAINTAIN -10C MINIMUM. T
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) freezer was the size of a
small closet, with shelves from floor to ceiling. M
ost of the shelves contained reagents and liquids
in plastic sacs. To one side he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) saw a smaller nitro
gen cold box with a heavy ceramic door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)
opened it, and a rack of small tubes slid out, in a
cloud of white liquid-nitrogen smoke.
The embryos were arranged by species: Stegosaurus,
Apatosaurus, Hadrosaurus,
Tyrannosaurus. Each embryo in a thin glass containe
r, wrapped in silver foil, stoppered with
polylene. Nedry quickly took two of each, slipping
them into the shaving cream can.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) screwed the base of the can shut and twiste
d the top. There was a hiss of releasing
gas inside, and the can frosted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) hands. Dodgs
on had said there was enough coolant to last
thirty-six hours. More than enough time to get back
to San Jos.
Nedry left the freezer, returned to the main lab. H
e dropped the can back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) bag, zipped it
shut.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) went back into the hallway. The theft had taken
less than two minutes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) could imagine
the consternation upstairs in the control room, as
they began to realize what had happened. All
their security codes were scrambled, and all their
phone lines were jammed. Without his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) help, it
would take hours to untangle the mess-but in just a
few minutes Nedry would he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) back in the
control room, setting things right.
And no one would ever suspect what he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) had done.
Grinning, Dennis Nedry walked down to the ground fl
oor, nodded to the guard, and continued
downstairs to the basement. Passing the neat lines
of electric Land Cruisers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) went to the
gasoline-powered Jeep parked against the wall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) c
limbed into it, noticing some odd gray tubing
on the passenger seat. It looked almost like a rock
et launcher, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) turned the
ignition key and started the Jeep.
Nedry glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) watch. From here, into the par
k, and three minutes straight to the east
dock. Three minutes from there back to the control
room.
Piece of cake.
``Damn it!'' Arnold said, punching buttons on the con
sole. ``It's all screwed up.
Muldoon was standing at the windows, looking out at
the park. The lights had gone out all over
the island, except in the immediate area around the
main buildings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) saw a few staff personnel
hurrying to get out of the rain, but no one seemed
to realize anything was wrong. Muldoon looked
over at the visitor lodge, where the lights burned
brightly.
<div class="bookquote">``Uh-oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``We have real trouble.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) turned away from th
e window, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) didn't see the Jeep
drive out of the underground garage and head east a
long the maintenance road into the park.
<div class="bookquote">``That idiot Nedry turned off the security systems,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``The whole building's opened
up. None of the doors are locked any more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll notify the guards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
<div class="bookquote">``That's the least of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``When you tu
rn off the security, you turn off all the
peripheral fences as well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The fences?''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
<div class="bookquote">``The electrical fences,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``They're off,
all over the island.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You mean ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``The animals can get o
ut now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold lit a cigarette. <div class="bookquote">``Probably
nothing will happen, but you never know...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon started toward the door. <div class="bookquote">``I better drive ou
t and bring in the people in those two Land
Cruisers,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Just in case.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon quickly went downstairs to the garage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) w
asn't really worried about the fences
going down. Most of the dinosaurs had been in their
paddocks for nine months or more, and they
had brushed up against the fences more than once, w
ith notable results. Muldoon knew how
quickly animals learned to avoid shock stimuli. You
could train a laboratory pigeon with just two or
three stimulation events. So it was unlikely the di
nosaurs would now approach the fences.
Muldoon was more concerned about what the people in
the cars would do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) didn't want
them getting out of the Land Cruisers, because once
the power came back on, the cars would
start moving again, whether the people were inside
them or not. They might be left behind. Of
course, in the rain it was unlikely they would leav
e the cars. But, still ... you never knew... .
He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) reached the garage and hurried toward the Jeep.
It was lucky, he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) thought, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) had had
the foresight to put the launcher in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) could s
tart right out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) out there in-
It was gone!
<div class="bookquote">``What the hell?''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon stared at the empty parkin
g space, astonished.
The Jeep was gone!
What the hell was happening?
FOURTH ITERATION

<p/>The Main Road
Rain drummed loudly on the roof of the Land Cruiser
. Tim felt the night-vision goggles pressing
heavily on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) forehead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) reached for the knob ne
ar his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) ear and adjusted the intensity. There
was a brief phosphorescent flare, and then, in shad
es of electronic green and black, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could see
the Land Cruiser behind, with Dr. Grant and Dr. Mal
colm inside. Neat!
Dr. Grant was staring out the front windshield towa
rd him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). Tim saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) pick up the radio from
the dash. There was a burst of static, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
heard Dr. Grant's voice: <div class="bookquote">``Can you see us back
here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Grant</b></font>)</div>Tim picked up the radio from Ed Regis. <div class="bookquote">``I see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything all right?''

Ed Regis snorted. <div class="bookquote">``It's pouring down rain. Of cours
e we'll stay in the car,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) muttered.
Tim turned to look at the foliage at the side of th
e road. Through the goggles, the foliage was a
bright electronic green, and beyond he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could see se
ctions of the green grid pattern of the fence.
The Land Cruisers were stopped on the downslope of
a hill, which must mean they were
someplace near the tyrannosaur area. It would be am
azing to see a tyrannosaur with these night-
vision goggles. A real thrill. Maybe the tyrannosau
r would come to the fence and look over at
them. Tim wondered if its eyes would glow in the da
rk when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw them. That would be neat.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) didn't see anything, and eventually he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) stopp
ed looking. Everyone in the cars fell silent.
The rain thrummed on the roof of the car. Sheets of
water streamed down over the sides of the
windows. It was hard for Tim to see out, even with
the goggles.
<div class="bookquote">``How long have we been sitting here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm asked
.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Four or five minutes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what the problem is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe a short circuit from the rain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it happened before the rain really started.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was another silence. In a tense voice, Lex sa
id, <div class="bookquote">``But there's no lightning, right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
had always been afraid of lightning, and she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) now sa
t nervously squeezing her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) leather mitt in her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
hands.
Dr. Grant said, <div class="bookquote">``What was that? We didn't quite rea
d that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Grant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just my sister talking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim again scanned the foliage, but saw nothing. Cer
tainly nothing as big as a tyrannosaur. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
began to wonder if the tyrannosaurs came out at nig
ht. Were they nocturnal animals? Tim wasn't
sure if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) had ever read that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) had the feeling t
hat tyrannosaurs were all-weather, day or night
animals. The time of day didn't matter to a tyranno
saur.
The rain continued to pour.
<div class="bookquote">``Hell of a rain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed Regis said. <div class="bookquote">``It's really comin

 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm hungry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know that, Lex,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Regis said, <div class="bookquote">``but we're stuck he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stuck for how long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Until they fix the electricity.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Listening to the sound of the rain, Tim felt himsel
f growing sleepy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) yawned, and turned to
look at the palm trees on the left side of the road
, and was startled by a sudden tbump as the
ground shook. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) swung back just in time to catch a
glimpse of a dark shape as it swiftly crossed
the road between the two cars.
<div class="bookquote">``Jesus! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What was it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was huge, it was big as the car-''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) picked up the radio. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you see it, Tim?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said. <div class="bookquote">``I missed it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What the hell was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you wearing the night-vision goggles, Tim?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I'll watch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
<div class="bookquote">``Was it the tyrannosaur?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed Regis asked.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't think so. It was in the road.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you didn't see it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed Regis said.
<div class="bookquote">``No. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim felt had that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) had missed seeing the animal w
hatever it was.
There was a sudden white crack of lightning, and hi
s night goggles flared bright green. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
blinked his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) eyes and started counting. <div class="bookquote">``One one tho
usand ... two one thousand ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>The thunder crashed, deafeningly loud and very clos
e. Lex began to cry. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Take it easy, honey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed Regis said. <div class="bookquote">``It's just li
ghtning.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim scanned the side of the road. The rain was comi
ng down bard now, shaking the leaves
with hammering drops. It made everything move. Ever
ything seemed alive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) scanned the
leaves... .
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) stopped. There was something beyond the leaves.
Tim
looked up, higher.
Behind the foliage, beyond the fence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw a thic
k body with a pebbled, grainy surface like
the bark of a tree. But it wasn't a tree. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) contin
ued to look higher, sweeping the goggles
upward-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw the huge head of the tyrannosaurus. Just sta
nding there, looking over the fence at the
two Land Cruisers. The lightning flashed again, and
the big animal rolled its head and bellowed in
the glaring light. Then darkness, and silence again
, and the pounding rain.
<div class="bookquote">``Tim?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Dr. Grant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You see what it is?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Dr. Grant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim had the sense that Dr. Grant was trying to talk
in a way that wouldn't upset his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) sister.
<div class="bookquote">``What's going on right now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said, watching the tyrannosaur throu
gh his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) night goggles. <div class="bookquote">``Just standing on the
other side of the fence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't see much from here, Tim.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can see fine, Dr. Grant. It's just standing ther
e.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex continued to cry, snuffling.
There was another pause. Tim watched the tyrannosau
r. The head was huge! The animal
looked from one vehicle to another. Then back again
. It seemed to stare right at Tim.
In the goggles, the eyes glowed bright green.
Tim felt a chill, but then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) looked down the a
nimal's body, moving down from the massive
head and jaws, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw the smaller, muscular forelim
b. It waved in the air and then it gripped the
fence.
<div class="bookquote">``Jesus Christ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Ed Regis said, staring out the wind
ow.
The greatest preditor the world has ever known. The
most fearsome attack in human history.
Somewhere in the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) publicist's brain, Ed
Regis was still writing copy. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) could feel
his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) knees begin to shake uncontrollably, his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) trouse
rs flapping like flags, Jesus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was frightened.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) didn't want to be here. Alone among all the peop
le in the two cars, Ed Regis knew what a
dinosaur attack was like. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) knew what happened to
people. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) had seen the mangled bodies
that resulted from a raptor attack. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) could pictur
e it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) mind. And this was a rex! Much, much
bigger! The greatest meat-eater that ever walked th
e earth!
Jesus.
When the tyrannosaur roared it was terrifying, a sc
ream from some other world. Ed Regis felt
the spreading warmth in his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) trousers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>)'d peed in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) pants. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) was simultaneously
embarrassed and terrified. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) had to do
something. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) couldn't just stay here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>)
had to do something. Something. His (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) hands were shak
ing, trembling against the dash.
<div class="bookquote">``Jesus Christ,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) said again.
<div class="bookquote">``Bad language,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, wagging her (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) finger at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
.
Tim heard the sound of a door opening, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) swung
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) head away from the tyrannosaur-the
night-vision goggles streaked laterally-in time to
see Ed Regis stepping out through the open
door, ducking his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) head in the rain.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, <div class="bookquote">``where are you going?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Ed Regis just turned and ran in the opposite direct
ion from the tyrannosaur, disappearing into
the woods. The door to the Land Cruiser hung open;
the paneling was getting wet.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) left!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``Where did he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) go? He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) left us a
lone!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shut the door,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had started to s
cream, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) left us! He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) left us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>s cream</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tim, what's going on?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Grant</b></font>)</div>It was Dr. Grant, on the ra
dio. <div class="bookquote">``Tim?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim leaned forward and tried to shut the door. From
the back seat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) couldn't reach the
handle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) looked back at the tyrannosaur as lightn
ing flashed again, momentarily silhouetting
the huge black shape against the white-flaring sky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tim, what's happening?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) left us, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) left us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim blinked to recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) vision. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) looked a
gain, the tyrannosaur was standing there,
exactly as before, motionless and huge. Rain drippe
d from its jaws. The forelimb gripped the
fence... .
And then Tim realized: the tyrannosaur was holding
on to the fence! The fence wasn't
electrified any more!
<div class="bookquote">``Lex, close the door!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The radio crackled. <div class="bookquote">``Tim!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm here, Dr. Grant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's going on?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Regis ran away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) what?''

<div class="bookquote">``The fence isn't electrified?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said, over t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) radio. <div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) say the fence isn't

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lex,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said, <div class="bookquote">``close the door. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>But Lex was scr

monotonous wail, and there was nothing for Tim to d
o but climb out of the back door, into the
slashing rain, and shut the door for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>). Thunder r
umbled, and the lightning flashed again. Tim
looked up and saw the tyrannosaur crashing down the
cyclone fence with a giant hind limb.
<div class="bookquote">``Timmy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) jumped back in and slammed the door, the sound l
ost in the tbunderclap.
The radio: <div class="bookquote">``Tim! Are you there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) grabbed the radio. <div class="bookquote">``I'm here.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) turned to Lex.
<div class="bookquote">``Lock the doors. Get in the middle of the
car. And shut up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Outside, the tyrannosaur rolled its head and took a
n awkward step forward. The claws of its
feet had caught in the grid of the flattened fence.
Lex saw the animal finally, and became silent,
still. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) watched with wide eyes.
Radio crackle. <div class="bookquote">``Tim.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Dr. Grant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stay in the car. Stay down. Be quiet. Don't move,
and don't make noise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You should be all right. I don't think it can open
the car.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Just stay quiet, so you don't arouse its attention
any more than necessary.
``Okay.'' Tim clicked the radio off. <div class="bookquote">``You hear that,
Lex?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) sister nodded, silently. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) never
took her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eyes off the dinosaur. The tyrannosaur roa
red. In the glare of lightning, they saw it pull
free of the fence and take a bounding step forward.

<p/>Now it was standing between the two cars. Tim could
n't see Dr. Grant's car any more, because
the huge body blocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) view. The rain ran in riv
ulets down the pebbled skin of the muscular
hind legs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) couldn't see the animal's head, which
was high above the roofline.
The tyrannosaur moved around the side of their car.
It went to the very spot where Tim had
gotten out of the car. Where Ed Regis had gotten ou
t of the car. The animal paused there. The
big head ducked down, toward the mud.
Tim looked back at Dr. Grant and Dr. Malcolm in the
rear car. Their faces were tense as they
stared forward through the windshield.
The huge head raised back up, jaws open, and then s
topped by the side windows. In the glare
of lightning, they saw the beady, expressionless re
ptile eye moving in the socket.
It was looking in the car.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) sister's breath came in ragged, frightened gasp
s. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) reached out and squeezed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) arm,
hoping she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would stay quiet. The dinosaur continued
to stare for a long time through the side
window. Perhaps the dinosaur couldn't really see th
em, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) thought. Finally the head lifted up, out of
view again.
<div class="bookquote">``Timmy ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex whispered.
<div class="bookquote">``It's okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim whispered. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think it saw u
s.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was looking back toward Dr. Grant when a jolting
impact rocked the Land Cruiser and
shattered the windshield in a spiderweb as the tyra
nnosaur's head crashed against the hood of
the Land Cruiser. Tim was knocked flat on the seat.
The night-vision goggles slid off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
forehead.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) got back up quickly, blinking in the darkness, h
is mouth warm with blood.
<div class="bookquote">``Lex?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) couldn't see his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) sister anywhere.
The tyrannosaur stood near the front of the Land Cr
uiser, its chest moving as it breathed, the
forelimbs making clawing movements in the air.
<div class="bookquote">``Lex!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim whispered. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) groan. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
was lying somewhere on the floor under
the front seat.
Then the huge head came down, entirely blocking the
shattered windshield. The tyrannosaur
banged again on the front hood of the Land Cruiser.
Tim grabbed the seat as the car rocked on
its wheels. The tyrannosaur banged down twice more,
denting the metal.
Then it moved around the side of the car. The big r
aised tail blocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) view out of all the side
windows. At the back, the animal snorted, a deep ru
mbling growl that blended with the thunder. It
sank its jaws into the spare tire mounted on the ba
ck of the Land Cruiser and, in a single head
shake, tore it away. The rear of the car lifted int
o the air for a moment; then it thumped down with a

<p/>muddy splash.
<div class="bookquote">``Tim!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Grant</b></font>)</div>Dr. Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``Tim, are you there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim grabbed the radio. <div class="bookquote">``We're okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said. There
was a shrill metallic scrape as claws
raked the roof of the car. Tim's heart was pounding
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) chest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) couldn't see anything out of
the windows on the right side except pebbled leathe
ry flesh. The tyrannosaur was leaning against
the car, which rocked back and forth with each brea
th, the springs and metal creaking loudly.
Lex groaned again. Tim put down the radio, and star
ted to crawl over into the front seat. The
tyrannosaur roared and the metal roof dented downwa
rd.. Tim felt a sharp pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) head and
tumbled to the floor, onto the transmission bump. H
e found himself lying alongside Lex, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
was shocked to see that the whole side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) head
was covered in blood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) looked
unconscious.
There was another jolting impact, and pieces of gla
ss fell all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>). Tim felt rain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
looked up and saw that the front windshield had bro
ken out. There was just a jagged rim of glass
and, beyond, the big head of the dinosaur.
Looking down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>).
Tim felt a sudden chill and then the head rushed fo
rward toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>), the jaws open. There
was the squeal of metal against teeth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) felt
the hot stinking breath of the animal and a thick
tongue stuck into the car through the windshield op
ening. The tongue slapped wetly around
inside the car-he felt the hot lather of dinosaur s
aliva-and the tyrannosaur roared-a deafening
sound inside the car-
The head pulled away abruptly.
Tim scrambled up, avoiding the dent in the roof. Th
ere was still room to sit on the front seat by
the passenger door. The tyrannosaur stood in the ra
in near the front fender. It seemed confused
by what had happened to it. Blood dripped freely fr
om its jaws.
The tyrannosaur looked at Tim, cocking its head to
stare with one big eye. The head moved
close to the car, sideways, and peered in. Blood sp
attered on the dented bood of the Land
Cruiser, mixing with the rain.
It can't get to me, Tim thought. It's too big.
Then the head pulled away, and in the flare of ligh
tning he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw the hind leg lift up. And the
world tilted crazily as the Land Cruiser slammed ov
er its side, the windows splatting in the mud.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw Lex fall helplessly against the side window,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) fell down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>), banging his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
head. Tim felt dizzy. Then the tyrannosaur's jaws c
lamped onto the window frame, and the whole
Land Cruiser was lifted up into the air, and shaken
.
<div class="bookquote">``Timmy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex shrieked, so near to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) ear that it h
urt. She (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was suddenly awake, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
grabbed her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) as the tyrannosaur crashed the car down
again. Tim felt a stabbing pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) side,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) sister fell on top of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>). The car went up
again, tilting crazily. Lex shouted <div class="bookquote">``Timmy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)

<p/>saw the door give way beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) fell out
of the car into the mud but Tim couldn't
answer, because in the next instant everything swun
g crazily-he saw the trunks of the palm trees
sliding downward past him-moving sideways through t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) air-he glimpsed the ground very far
below-the hot roar of the tyrannosaur-the blazing e
ye-the tops of the palm trees-
And then, with a metallic scraping shriek, the car
fell from the tyrannosaur's jaws, a sickening
fall, and Tim's stomach heaved in the moment before
the world became totally black, and silent.
In the other car, Malcolm gasped. <div class="bookquote">``Jesus! What happ
ened to the car?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant blinked his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) eyes as
the lightning faded.
The other car was gone.
Grant couldn't believe it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) peered forward, tryin
g to see through the rain-streaked windshield.
The dinosaur's body was so large, it was probably j
ust blocking-
No. In another flash of lightning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw clearly:
the car was gone.
<div class="bookquote">``What happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Faintly, over the rain, Grant heard the sound of th
e little girl screaming. The dinosaur was
standing in darkness on the road up ahead, but they
could see well enough to know that it was
bending over now, sniffing the ground.
Or eating something on the ground.
<div class="bookquote">``Can you see?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said, squinting.
<div class="bookquote">``Not much, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. The rain pounded on the
roof of the car. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) listened for the little
girl, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) didn't hear her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) any more. The two men
sat in the car, listening.
<div class="bookquote">``Was it the girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said, finally. <div class="bookquote">``It sound
ed like the girl.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It did, yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Was it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) felt a seeping fatig
ue overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). Blurred through the rainy
windshield, the dinosaur was coming toward their ca
r. Slow, ominous strides, coming right toward
them.
Malcolm said, <div class="bookquote">``You know, at times like this one fee
ls, well, perhaps extinct animals should be
left extinct. Don't you have that feeling now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heart poundin
g.
<div class="bookquote">``Umm. Do you, ah, have any suggestions about what w
e do now?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I
can't think of a thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
Malcolm twisted the handle, kicked open the door, a
nd ran. But even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) did, Grant could
see he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was too late, the tyrannosaur too close. The
re was another crack of lightning, and in that
instant of glaring white light, Grant watched in ho
rror as the tyrannosaur roared, and leapt
forward.
Grant was not clear about exactly what happened nex
t. Malcolm was running, his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) feet
splashing in the mud. The tyrannosaur bounded along
side him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) and ducked its massive head, and
Malcolm was tossed into the air like a small doll.
By then Grant was out of the car, too, feeling the
cold rain slashing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) face and body. The
tyrannosaur had turned its back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), the huge ta
il swinging through the air. Grant was tensing to
run for the woods when suddenly the tyrannosaur spu
n back to face him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), and roared.
Grant froze.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was standing beside the passenger door of the La
nd Cruiser, drenched in rain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was
completely exposed, the tyrannosaur no more than ei
ght feet away. The big animal roared again.
At so close a range the sound was terrifyingly loud
. Grant felt himself shaking with cold and fright.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) trembling hands against the metal of
the door panel to steady them.
The tyrannosaur roared once more, but it did not at
tack. It cocked its head, and looked with
first one eye, then the other, at the Land Cruiser.
And it did nothing.
It just stood there.
What was going on?
The powerful jaws opened and closed. The tyrannosau
r bellowed angrily, and then the big hind
leg came up and crashed down on the roof of the car
; the claws slid off with a metal screech,
barely missing Grant as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) stood there, still unmov
ing.
The foot splashed in the mud. The head ducked down
in a slow arc, and the animal inspected
the car, snorting. It peered into the front windshi
eld. Then, moving toward the rear, it banged the
passenger door shut, and moved right toward Grant a
s he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) stood there. Grant was dizzy with fear
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heart pounding inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) chest. With the anima
l so close, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could smell the rotten flesh in
the mouth, the sweetish blood-smell, the sickening
stench of the carnivore... .
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) tensed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) body, awaiting the inevitable.
The big head slid past him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), toward the rear of the
car. Grant blinked.
What had happened?
Was it possible the tyrannosaur hadn't seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)? It
seemed as if it hadn't. But how could that
be? Grant looked back to see the animal sniffing th
e rear-mounted tire. It nudged the tire with its
snout, and then the head swung back. Again it appro
ached Grant.
This time the animal stopped, the black flaying nos
trils just inches away. Grant felt the animal's
startling hot breath on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) face. But the tyrannosa
ur wasn't sniffing like a dog. It was just
breathing, and if anything it seemed puzzled.
No, the tyrannosaur couldn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). Not if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sto
od motionless. And in a detached academic
corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) found an explanation for that
, a reason why-
The laws opened before him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), the massive head raised
up. Grant squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) fists together,
and bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) lip, trying desperately to remain motio
nless, to make no sound.
The tyrannosaur bellowed in the night air.
But by now Grant was beginning to understand. The a
nimal couldn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), but it suspected
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was there, somewhere, and was trying with its be
llowing to frighten Grant into some revealing
movement. So long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) stood his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) ground, Grant rea
lized, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was invisible.
In a final gesture of frustration, the big hind leg
lifted up and kicked the Land Cruiser over, and
Grant felt searing pain and the surprising sensatio
n of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) own body flying through the air. It
seemed to be happening very slowly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had plen
ty of time to feel the world turn colder, and
watch the ground rush up to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) in the face.

 (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>They were sitting in Harding's gasoline-powered Jee

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was nothing but steady hissing static. <div class="bookquote">``I don

<p/>suppose,'' Harding said.
``Try the Land Cruisers,'' Ellie said.
Harding opened the other channels, but there was no
answer.
``Nothing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) said. ``They're probably back to camp
by now, and outside the range of our little
set. In any case, I don't think we should stay here
. It'll be hours before Maintenance gets a crew
out here to move that tree.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) turned the radio off, and put the Jeep into reve
rse.
``Wbat're you going to do?'' Ellie said.
``Go back to the turnout, and get onto the maintenan
ce road. Fortunately there's a second road
system,'' Harding explained. ``We have one road for v
isitors, and a second road for animal
handlers and feed trucks and so on. We'll drive bac
k on that maintenance road. It's a little longer.
And not so scenic. But you may find it interesting.
If the rain lets up, we'll get a glimpse of some o
f
the animals at night. We should be back in thirty,
forty minutes,'' Harding said. <div class="bookquote">``If I don't get lost.
''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) turned the Jeep around in the night, and headed
south again.
Lightning flashed, and every monitor in the control
room went black.
Arnold sat forward, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) body rigid and tense. Jesus
, not now. Not now. That was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) needed-
to have everything go out now in the storm. All the
main power circuits were surge-protected, of
course, but Arnold wasn't sure about the modems Ned
ry was using for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) data transmission.
Most people didn't know it was possible to blow an
entire system through a modem-the lightning
pulse climbed back into the computer through the te
lephone line, and-bang!-no more
motherboard. No more RAM. No more file server. No m
ore computer.
The screens flickered. And then, one by one, they c
ame back on.
Arnold sighed, and collapsed back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) chair.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) wondered again where Nedry had gone. Five minute
s ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)'d sent guards to search the
building for him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>). The fat bastard was probably in t
he (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) bathroom reading a comic book. But the
guards hadn't come back, and they hadn't called in.

<p/>Five minutes. If Nedry was in the building, they sh
ould have found him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) by now.
<div class="bookquote">``Somebody took the damned Jeep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>Nedry/Dennis Nedry/Dennis</b></font>)</div>Nedry
The sign said ELECTRIFIED FENCE 10,000 VOLTS DO NOT
TOUCH, but Nedry opened it with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) bare band, and unlocked the gate, swinging it w
ide. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) went back to the Jeep, drove through
the gate, and then walked back to close it behind h
im.
Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) was inside the park itself, no more than a m
ile from the east dock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) stepped on the
accelerator and bunched forward over the steering w
heel, peering through the rain-slashed
windshield as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) drove the Jeep down the narrow roa
d. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) was driving fast-too fast-but he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) had to
keep to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) timetable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) was surrounded on all sid
es by black jungle, but soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) should be
able to see the beach and the ocean off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) left
.
This damned storm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) thought. It might screw up ev
erything. Because if Dodgson's boat
wasn't waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) at the east dock when Nedry
got there, the whole plan would be ruined.
Nedry couldn't wait very long, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) would be misse
d back at the control room. The whole idea
behind the plan was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) could drive to the east
dock, drop off the embryos, and be back in a
few minutes, before anyone noticed. It was a good p
lan, a clever plan. Nedry'd worked on it
carefully, refining every detail. This plan was goi
ng to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) a million and a half dollars, one
point five meg. That was ten years of income in a s
ingle tax-free shot, and it was going to change
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) life. Nedry'd been damned careful, even to the
point of making Dodgson meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) in the San
Francisco airport at the last minute with an excuse
about wanting to see the money, Actually,
Nedry wanted to record his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) conversation with Dodgso
n, and mention him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) by name on the tape.
Just so that Dodgson wouldn't forget he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodgson</b></font>) owed the re
st of the money, Nedry was including a copy of
the tape with the embryos. In short, Nedry had thou
ght of everything.
Except this damned storm.
Something dashed across the road, a white flash in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) headlights. It looked like a large rat. It
scurried into the underbrush, dragging a fat tail.
Possum. Amazing that a possum could survive
here. You'd think the dinosaurs would get an animal
like that.
Where was the damned dock?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) was driving fast, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)'d already been gone fiv
e minutes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) should have reached the
east dock by now. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) taken a wrong turn? He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) did
n't think so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) hadn't seen any forks in the
road at all.
Then where was the dock?
It was a shock when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) came around a corner and saw
that the road terminated in a gray
concrete barrier, six feet tall and streaked dark w
ith rain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) slammed on the brakes, and the
Jeep fishtailed, losing traction in an end-to-end s
pin, and for a horrified moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)
was going to smash into the barrier-he knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) was
going to smash-and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) spun the wheel
frantically, and the Jeep slid to a stop, the headl
amps just a foot from the concrete wall.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) paused there, listening to the rhythmic flick of
the wipers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) took a deep breath and
exhaled slowly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) looked back down the road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)'d
obviously taken a wrong turn somewhere.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) could retrace his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) steps, but that would take too
long.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)'d better try and find out where the hell he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) was.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) got out of the Jeep, feeling heavy raindrops spa
tter his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) head. It was a real tropical storm,
raining so hard that it hurt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) wat
ch, pushing the button to illuminate the digital
dial. Six minutes gone. Where the hell was he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) w
alked around the concrete barrier and on the
other side, along with the rain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) heard the sound
of gurgling water. Could it be the ocean?
Nedry hurried forward, his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) eyes adjusting to the da
rkness as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) went. Dense jungle on all sides.
Raindrops slapping on the leaves.
The gurgling sound became louder, drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) forwa
rd, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) came out of the
foliage and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) feet sink into soft earth and
saw the dark currents of the river. The river! He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)
was at the jungle river!
Damn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) thought. At the river where? The river ran
for miles through the island. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) looked at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) watch again. Seven minutes gone. <div class="bookquote">``You have a pr
oblem, Dennis,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) said aloud.
As if in reply, there was a soft hooting cry of an
owl in the forest.
Nedry hardly noticed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) was worrying about his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) pla
n. The plain fact was that time had run out.
There wasn't a choice any more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) had to abandon h
is original plan. All he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) could do was go
back to the control room, restore the computer, and
somehow try to contact Dodgson, to set up
the drop at the east dock for the following night.
Nedry would have to scramble to make that
work, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) could pull it off. The comp
uter automatically logged all calls; after Nedry
got through to Dodgson, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)'d have to go back into t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) computer and erase the record of the call.
But one thing was sure-he couldn't stay out in the
park any longer, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) absence would be
noticed.
Nedry started back, heading toward the glow of the
car's headlights. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) was drenched and
miserable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) heard the soft booting cry once more,
and this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) paused. That hadn't really
sounded like an owl. And it seemed to be close by,
in the jungle somewhere off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) right.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) listened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) heard a crashing sound in the un
derbrush. Then silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) waited, and
heard it again. It sounded distinctly like somethin
g big, moving slowly through the jungle toward
him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>).
Something big. Something near. A big dinosaur. Get

<p/>out of here.
Nedry began to run. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) made a lot of noise as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) ra
n, but even so he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) could hear the animal
crashing through the foliage. And hooting.
It was coming closer.
Stumbling over tree roots in the darkness, clawing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) way past dripping branches, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) saw the
Jeep ahead, and the lights shining around the verti
cal wall of the barrier made him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) feel better. In
a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)'d be in the car and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)'d get the h
ell out of here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) scrambled around the
barrier and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) froze.
The animal was already there.
But it wasn't close. The dinosaur stood forty feet
away, at the edge of the illumination from the
headlamps. Nedry hadn't taken the tour, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) hadn'
t seen the different types of dinosaurs, but
this one was strange-looking. The ten-foot-tall bod
y was yellow with black spots, and along the
head ran a pair of red V-shaped crests. The dinosau
r didn't move, but again gave its soft hooting
cry.
Nedry waited to see if it would attack. It didn't.
Perhaps the headlights from the Jeep frightened it,

<p/>forcing it to keep its distance, like a fire.
The dinosaur stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) and then snapped its hea
d in a single swift motion. Nedry felt
something smack wetly against his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) chest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) looked
down and saw a dripping glob of foam on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) rain-soaked shirt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) touched it curiously, not
comprehending... .
It was spit.
The dinosaur had spit on him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>).
It was creepy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) looked back at the di
nosaur and saw the head snap again, and
immediately felt another wet smack against his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) neck
, just above the shirt collar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) wiped it away
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) hand.
Jesus, it was disgusting. But the skin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) neck
was already starting to tingle and burn. And
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) hand was tingling, too. It was almost like he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) h
ad been touched with acid.
Nedry opened the car door, glancing back at the din
osaur to make sure it wasn't going to
attack, and felt a sudden, excruciating pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)
eyes, stabbing like spikes into the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)
skull, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) eyes shut and gasped wit
h the intensity of it and threw up his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) hands
to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) eyes and felt the slippery foam trickl
ing down both sides of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) nose.
Spit.
The dinosaur had spit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) eyes.
Even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) realized it, the pain overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>), a
nd he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) dropped to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) knees, disoriented,
wheezing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) collapsed onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) side, his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) cheek pre
ssed to the wet ground, his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) breath coming in
thin whistles through the constant, ever-screaming
pain that caused flashing spots of light to
appear behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) tightly shut eyelids.
The earth shook beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) and Nedry knew the dino
saur was moving, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) could hear its soft
hooting cry, and despite the pain he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) forced his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) eye
s open and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) saw nothing but flashing
spots against black. Slowly the realization came to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) was blind.
The hooting was louder as Nedry scrambled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) fe
et and staggered back against the side
panel of the car, as a wave of nausea and dizziness
swept over him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>). The dinosaur was close
now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) could feel it coming close, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) was dimly aw
are of its snorting breath.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) couldn't see.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) couldn't see anything, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) terror was extrem
e.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) hands, waving them wildly in t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) air to ward off the attack he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) knew was
coming.
And then there was a new, searing pain, like a fier
y knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) belly, and Nedry stumbled,
reaching blindly down to touch the ragged edge of h
is shirt, and then a thick, slippery mass that
was surprisingly warm, and with horror he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) suddenly
knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) was holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) own intestines in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>)
hands. The dinosaur had torn him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) open. His (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) guts had
fallen out.
Nedry fell to the ground and landed on something sc
aly and cold, it was the animal's foot, and
then there was new pain on both sides of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) head.
The pain grew worse, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) was lifted to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) feet he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) knew the dinosaur had his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) head in its j
aws, and the horror of that realization was
followed by a final wish, that it would all be ende
d soon.
Bungalow
<div class="bookquote">``More coffee?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond asked politely.
<div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Henry Wu said, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>)
chair. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't eat anything more.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>They
were sitting in the dining room of Hammond's bungal
ow, in a secluded corner of the park not far
from the labs. Wu had to admit that the bungalow Ha
mmond had built for himself was elegant,
with sparse, almost Japanese lines. And the dinner
had been excellent, considering the dining
room wasn't fully staffed yet.
But there was something about Hammond that Wu found
troubling. The old man was different in
some way ... subtly different. All during dinner,
Wu had tried to decide what it was. In part, a
tendency to ramble, to repeat himself, to retell ol
d stories. In part, it was an emotional lability,
flaring anger one moment, maudlin sentimentality th
e next. But all that could be understood as a
natural concomitant of age. John Hammond was, after
all, almost seventy-seven.
But there was something else. A stubborn evasivenes
s. An insistence on having his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) way. And, in
the end, a complete refusal to deal with the situat
ion that now faced the park.
Wu had been stunned by the evidence -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) did not yet
allow himself to believe the case was
proved-RRB- that the dinosaurs were breeding. After Gra
nt had asked about amphibian DNA, Wu had
intended to go directly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) laboratory and check
the computer records of the various DNA
assemblies. Because, if the dinosaurs were in fact
breeding, then everything about Jurassic Park
was called into question-their genetic development
methods, their genetic control methods,
everything. Even the lysine dependency might be sus
pect. And if these animals could truly breed,
and could also survive in the wild ...
Henry Wu wanted to check the data at once. But Hamm
ond had stubbornly insisted Wu
accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) at dinner.
<div class="bookquote">``Now then, Henry, you must save room for ice cream,
''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said, pushing back from the
table. <div class="bookquote">``Maria makes the most wonderful ginger ice c
ream.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu looked at the beautiful, silent ser
ving girl. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) eyes followed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out of the room,
and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) glanced up at the single video monitor
mounted in the wall. The monitor was dark.
<div class="bookquote">``Your monitor's out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said.
<div class="bookquote">``Is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond glanced over. <div class="bookquote">``Must be the storm.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) reached behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) for the telephone.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll just check with John in control.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu could hear the static crackle on the telephone l
ine. Hammond shrugged, and set the
receiver back in its cradle. <div class="bookquote">``Lines must be down,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Or maybe Nedry's still doing data
transmission. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) has quite a few bugs to fix this w
eekend. Nedry's a genius in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) way, but we
had to press him (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) quite hard, toward the end, to mak
e sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) got things right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I should go to the control room and check,
''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said.
<div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said, <div class="bookquote">``There's no reason. If ther
e were any problem, we'd hear about it.
Ah.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Maria came back into the room, with two plates of i
ce cream.
<div class="bookquote">``You must have just a little, Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said.
<div class="bookquote">``It's made with fresh ginger, from the
eastern part of the island. It's an old man's vice,
ice cream. But still ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Dutifully, Wu dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) spoon. Outside, lightning
flashed, and there was the sharp crack of
thunder. <div class="bookquote">``That was close,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said. <div class="bookquote">``I hope the sto
rm isn't frightening the children.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) tasted the
ice cream. <div class="bookquote">``But I can't help but hold some
fears about this park, Henry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Inwardly, Wu felt relieved. Perhaps the old man was
going to face the facts, after all. <div class="bookquote">``What
kind of fears?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know, Jurassic Park's really made for children
. The children of the world love dinosaurs,
and the children are going to delight-just delight-
in this place. Their little faces will shine with t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
joy of finally seeing these wonderful animals. But
I am afraid ... I may not live to see it, Henry.
I
may not live to see the joy on their faces.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think there are other problems, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said, f
rowning.
<div class="bookquote">``But none so pressing on my mind as this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond
said, <div class="bookquote">``that I may not live to see their
shining, delighted faces. This is our triumph, this
park. We have done what we set out to do. And,
you remember, our original intent was to use the ne
wly emerging technology of genetic
engineering to make money. A lot of money.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Wu knew Hammond was about to launch into one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)
old speeches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm familiar with this, John-''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If you were going to start a bioengineering compan
y, Henry, what would you do? Would you
make products to help mankind, to fight illness and
disease? Dear me, no. That's a terrible idea.
A very poor use of new technology.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) head sadly. <div class="bookquote">``Yet, you'll remember
,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the original genetic
engineering companies, like Genentech and Cetus, we
re all started to make pharmaceuticals.
New drugs for mankind. Noble, noble purpose. Unfort
unately, drugs face all kinds of barriers.
FDA testing alone takes five to eight years-if you'
re lucky. Even worse, there are forces at work in
the marketplace. Suppose you make a miracle drug fo
r cancer or heart disease-as Genentech
did. Suppose you now want to charge a thousand doll
ars or two thousand dollars a dose. You
might imagine that is your privilege. After all, yo
u invented the drug, you paid to develop and test
it; you should be able to charge whatever you wish.
But do you really think that the government
will let you do that? No, Henry, they will not. Sic
k people aren't going to pay a thousand dollars a
dose for needed medication-they won't be grateful,
they'll be outraged. Blue Cross isn't going to
pay it. They'll scream highway robbery. So somethin
g will happen. Your patent application will be
denied. Your permits will be delayed. Something wil
l force you to see reason-and to sell your
drug at a lower cost. From a business standpoint, t
hat makes helping mankind a very risky
business. Personally, I would never help mankind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Wu had heard the argument before. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) knew Hammo
nd was right, some new
bioengineered pharmaceuticals had indeed suffered i
nexplicable delays and patent problems.
<div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said, <div class="bookquote">``think how different it is whe
n you're making entertainment, Nobody
needs entertainment. That's not a matter for govern
ment intervention. If I charge five thousand
dollars a day for my park, who is going to stop me?
After all, nobody needs to come here. And,
far from being highway robbery, a costly price tag
actually increases the appeal of the park. A
visit becomes a status symbol, and all Americans lo
ve that. So do the Japanese, and of course
they have far more money.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) ice cream, and Maria silently
took the dish away. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s not from here,
you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s Haitian. Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mother is F
rench. But in any case, Henry, you will recall
that the original purpose behind pointing my compan
y in this direction in the first place-was to
have freedom from government intervention, anywhere
in the world.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Speaking of the rest of the world ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond smiled. <div class="bookquote">``We have already leased a large tra
ct in the Azores, for Jurassic Park
Europe. And you know we long ago obtained an island
near Guam, for Jurassic Park Japan.
Construction on the next two Jurassic Parks will be
gin early next year. They will all be open
within four years. At that time, direct revenues wi
ll exceed ten billion dollars a year, and
merchandising, television, and ancillary rights sho

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Twenty billion dollars a year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said softly, sh

<div class="bookquote">``That's speaking conservatively,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``About ten, fifteen minutes ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jesus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
The Jeep screeched to a stop. <div class="bookquote">``Sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Harding said
.
In the headlamps, Ellie saw a herd of apatosaurs lu
mbering across the road. There were six
animals, each the size of a house, and a baby as la
rge as a full-grown horse. The apatosaurs
moved in unhurried silence, never looking toward th
e Jeep and its glowing headlamps. At one
point, the baby stopped to lap water from a puddle
in the road, then moved on.
A comparable herd of elephants would have been star
tled by the arrival of a car, would have
trumpeted and circled to protect the baby. But thes
e animals showed no fear. <div class="bookquote">``Don't they see
us?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>baby</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Not exactly, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Harding said. ``Of course, in a l
iteral sense they do see us, but we don't really
mean anything to them. We hardly ever take cars out
at night, and so they have no experience of
them. We are just a strange, smelly object in their
environment. Representing no threat, and
therefore no interest. I've occasionally been out a
t night, visiting a sick animal, and on my way
back these fellows blocked the road for an hour or
more.
``What do you do?''
Harding grinned. ``Play a recorded tyrannosaur roar.
That gets them moving. Not that they care
much about tyrannosaurs. These apatosaurs are so bi
g they don't really have any predators.
They can break a tyrannosaur's neck with a swipe of
their tail. And they know it. So does the
tyrannosaur.''
``But they do see us. I mean, if we were to get out
of the car ...''
Harding shrugged. ``They probably wouldn't react. Di
nosaurs have excellent visual acuity, but
they have a basic amphibian visual system: it's att
uned to movement. They don't see unmoving
things well at all.''
The animals moved on, their skin glistening in the
rain. Harding put the car in gear. ``I think we
can continue now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) said.
Wu said, ``I suspect you may find there are pressure
s on your park, just as there are pressures on
Genentech's drugs.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) and Hammond had moved to the
living room, and they were now
watching the storm lash the big glass windows.
``I can't see how,'' Hammond said.
``The scientists may wish to constrain you. Even to
stop you.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, they can't do that, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) shook
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) finger at Wu. <div class="bookquote">``You know why the
scientists would try to do that? It's because they
want to do research, of course. That's all they
ever want to do, is research. Not to accomplish any
thing. Not to make any progress. Just do
research. Well, they have a surprise coming to them
.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't thinking of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said.
Hammond sighed. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure it would be interesting f
or the scientists, to do research. But you
arrive at the point where these animals are simply
too expensive to be used for research. This is
wonderful technology, Henry, but it's also frightfu
lly expensive technology. The fact is, it can only
be supported as entertainment.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond shrugged. <div class="bookquote">''
That's just the way it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But if there are attempts to close down-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Face the damn facts, Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said irritabl
y. <div class="bookquote">``This isn't America. This isn't even
Costa Rica. This is my island. I own it. And nothin
g is going to stop me from opening Jurassic
Park to all the children of the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) chuckled
. <div class="bookquote">``Or, at least, to the rich ones. And I tell you,
they'll love it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>In the back seat of the Jeep, Ellie Sattler stared
out the window. They had been driving through
rain-drenched jungle for the last twenty minutes, a
nd had seen nothing since the apatosaurs
crossed the road.
<div class="bookquote">``We're near the jungle river now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Harding said, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) drove. <div class="bookquote">``It's off there somewhere to our
left.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Abruptly he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) slammed on the brakes again, The car sk
idded to a stop in front of a flock of small
green animals. <div class="bookquote">``Well, you're getting quite a show t
onight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Those are compys.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Procompsognathids, Ellie thought, wishing that Gran
t were here to see them. This was the
animal they had seen in the fax, back in Montana. T
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) little dark green procompsognathids
scurried to the other side of the road, then squatt
ed on their hind legs to look at the car,
chattering briefly, before hurrying onward into the
night.
<div class="bookquote">``Odd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Harding said. <div class="bookquote">``Wonder where they're off to?
Compys don't usually move at night, you
know. They climb up in a tree and wait for daylight

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then why are they out now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said.
<div class="bookquote">``I can't imagine. You know compys are scavengers, l

They can smell a dying animal for miles.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then they're going to a dying animal?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dying, or already dead.''

<div class="bookquote">``I'd be curious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Harding said. ``Yes, why not? Let'
s go see where they're going. He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
turned the car around, and headed back toward the c
ompys.
Tim
Tim Murphy lay in the Land Cruiser, his (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) cheek press
ed against the car door handle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) drifted
slowly back to consciousness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) wanted only to sle
ep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) position, and felt the pain
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) cheekbone where it lay against the metal doo
r. His (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) whole body ached. His (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) arms and his (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>)
legs and most of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) head-there was a terrible
pounding pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) head. All the pain made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) want to go back to sleep.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) pushed himself up on one elbow, opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) eyes,
and retched, vomiting all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) shirt.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) tasted sour bile and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) mouth with the ba
ck of his (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) hand. His (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) head throbbed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) felt
dizzy and seasick, as if the world were moving, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) were rocking back and forth on a boat.
Tim groaned, and rolled onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) back, turning away
from the puddle of vomit. The pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
head made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) breathe in short, shallow gasps. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) still felt sick, as if everything were
moving. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) eyes and looked around, tryin
g to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) bearings.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was inside the Land Cruiser. But the car must ha
ve flipped over on its side, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
was lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) back against the passenger door, l
ooking up at the steering wheel and beyond, at
the branches of a tree, moving in the wind. The rai
n had nearly stopped, but water drops still fell
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) through the broken front windshield.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) stared curiously at the fragments of glass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) c
ouldn't remember how the windshield had
broken. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) couldn't remember anything except that t
hey had been parked on the road and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
had been talking to Dr. Grant when the tyrannosaur
came toward them. That was the last thing
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) remembered.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) felt sick again, and closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) eyes until the n
ausea passed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was aware of a rhythmic
creaking sound, like the rigging of a boat. Dizzy a
nd sick to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) stomach, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) really felt as if the
whole car were moving beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) open
ed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) eyes again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw it was true-the
Land Cruiser was moving, lying on its side, swaying
back and forth.
The whole car was moving.
Tentatively, Tim rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) feet. Standing on the
passenger door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) peered over the
dashboard, looking out through the shattered windsh
ield. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw only dense foliage,
moving in the wind. But here and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could see
gaps, and beyond the foliage, the ground
was-
The ground was twenty feet below him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) stared uncomprehendingly. The Land Cruiser was l
ying on its side in the branches of a
large tree, twenty feet above the ground, swaying b
ack and forth in the wind.
``Oh shit,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) said. What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) going to do? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) sto
od on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) tiptoes and peered out, trying to
see better, grabbing the steering wheel for support
. The wheel spun free in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) hand, and with a
loud crack the Land Cruiser shifted position, dropp
ing a few feet in the branches of the tree. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
looked down through the shattered glass of the pass
enger-door window at the ground below.
``Oh shit. Oh shit.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) kept repeating it. <div class="bookquote">``Oh shit.
Oh shit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Another loud crack-the Land Cruiser jolted down ano
ther foot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
had to get out of here.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was standing on the
door handle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) crouched back down on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) bands and knees to look at the handle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could
n't see very well in the dark, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could tell
that the door was dented outward so the handle coul
dn't turn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)'d never get the door open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
tried to roll the window down, but the window was s
tuck, too. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) thought of the back door.
Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) could open that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) leaned over the front
seat, and the Land Cruiser lurched with the
shift in weight.
Carefully, Tim reached back and twisted the handle
on the rear door. It
was stuck, too.
How was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) going to get out?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) heard a snorting sound and looked down. A dark s
hape passed below him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>). It wasn't the
tyrannosaur. This shape was tubby and it made a kin
d of snuffling as it waddled along. The tail
flopped back and forth, and Tim could see the long
spikes.
It was the stegosaur, apparently recovered from its
illness. Tim wondered where the other
people were: Gennaro and Sattler and the vet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) ha
d last seen them near the stegosaur. How
long ago was that? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) watch, but the
face was cracked; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) couldn't see the
numbers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) took the watch off and tossed it aside.

<p/>The stegosaur snuffled and moved on. Now the only s
ound was the wind in the trees, and the
creaking of the Land Cruiser as it shifted back and
forth.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) had to get out of here.
Tim grabbed the handle, tried to force it, but it w
as stuck solid. It wouldn't move at all. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
realized what was wrong: the rear door was locked!
Tim pulled up the pin and twisted the handle.
The rear door swung open, downward-and came to rest
against the branch a few feet below.
The opening was narrow, but Tim thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could wr
iggle through it. Holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) breath, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
crawled slowly back into the rear seat. The Land Cr
uiser creaked, but held its position. Gripping
the doorposts on both sides, Tim slowly lowered him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
self down, through the narrow angled
opening of the door. Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was lying flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
stomach on the slanted door, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) legs sticking
out of the car. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) kicked in the air-his feet touch
ed something solid-a branch-and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
weight on it.
As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) did, the branch bent down and the doo
r swung wider, spilling him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) out of the
Land Cruiser, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) fell-leaves scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) fac
e-his body bouncing from branch to branch-a
jolt-searing pain, bright light in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) head-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) slammed to a stop, the wind knocked from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>). Ti
m lay doubled over a large branch, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
stomach burning pain.
Tim heard another crack and looked up at the Land C
ruiser, a big dark shape five feet above
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>).
Another crack. The car shifted.
Tim forced himself to move, to climb down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) used
to like to climb trees. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was a good tree-
climber. And this was a good tree to climb, the bra
nches spaced close together, almost like a
staircase... .
Crackkkk ...
The car was definitely moving.
Tim scrambled downward, slipping over the wet branc
hes, feeling sticky sap on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) hands,
hurrying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) had not descended more than a few feet
when the Land Cruiser creaked a final
time, and then slowly, very slowly, nosed over. Tim
could see the big green grille and the front
headlights swinging down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>), and then the Land
Cruiser fell free, gaining momentum as it
rushed toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>), slamming against the branch wher
e Tim had just been-
And it stopped.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) face just inches from the dented grille, bent i
nward like an evil mouth, headlamps for eyes.
Oil dripped on Tim's face.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was still twelve feet above the ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) reach
ed down, found another branch, and
moved down. Above, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw the branch bending under
the weight of the Land Cruiser, and then
it cracked, and the Land Cruiser came rushing down
toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could never
escape it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could never get down fast enough, so
Tim just let go.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) fell the rest of the way.
Tumbling, banging, feeling pain in every part of hi
s body, hearing the Land Cruiser smashing
down through the branches after him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) like a pursuing
animal, and then Tim's shoulder hit the soft
ground, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) rolled as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could, and pres
sed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) body against the trunk of the tree as
the Land Cruiser tumbled down with a loud metallic
crash and a sudden hot burst of electrical
sparks that stung his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) skin and sputtered and sizzle
d on the wet ground around him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>).
Slowly, Tim got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) feet. In the darkness he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) hea
rd the snuffling, and saw the stegosaur coming
back, apparently attracted by the crash of the Land
Cruiser. The dinosaur moved dumbly, the low
head thrust forward, and the big cartilaginous plat
es running in two rows along the bump of the
back. It behaved like an overgrown tortoise. Stupid
like that. And slow.
Tim picked up a rock and threw it. <div class="bookquote">``Get away!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The rock tbunked dully off the plates. The stegosau
r kept coming. <div class="bookquote">``Go on! Co!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) threw another rock, and hit the stegosaur in the
head. The animal grunted, turned slowly
away, and shuffled off in the direction it had come
.
Tim leaned against the crumpled Land Cruiser and lo
oked around in the darkness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) had to
get back to the others, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) didn't want to get l
ost. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was somewhere in the park,
probably not far from the main road. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could on
ly get his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) hearings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) couldn't see much in the
dark, but-
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) remembered the goggles.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) climbed through the shattered front windshield i
nto the Land Cruiser and found the night-
vision goggles, and the radio. The radio was broken
and silent, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) left it behind. But the
goggles still worked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) flicked them on, saw the r
eassuringly familiar phosphorescent green
image.
Wearing the goggles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw the battered fence off
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) left, and walked toward it. The fence
was twelve feet high, but the tyrannosaur had flatt
ened it easily. Tim hurried across it, moved
through an area of dense foliage, and came out onto
the main road.
Through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) goggles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw the other Land Cruiser
turned on its side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) ran toward it, took a
breath, and looked inside. The car was empty. No si
gn of Dr. Grant and Dr. Malcolm.
Where had they gone?
Where had everybody gone?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) felt sudden panic, standing alone in the jungle
road at night with that empty car, and turned
quickly in circles, seeing the bright green world i
n the goggles swirl. Something pale by the side of
the road caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) eye. It was Lex's baseball. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>)
wiped the mud off it.
<div class="bookquote">``Lex!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim shouted as loud as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could, not caring if the
animals heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) listened, but there
was only the wind, and the plink of raindrops falli
ng from the trees.
'' Lex!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) vaguely remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) had been in the Land
Cruiser when the tyrannosaur
attacked. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) stayed there? Or had she (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) gotten a
way? The events of the attack were
confused in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) wasn't exactly sure what h
ad happened, just to think of it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
uneasy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) stood in the road, gasping with panic.
``Lex!''
The night seemed to close in around him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>). Feeling so
rry for himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) sat in a cold rainy
puddle in the road and whimpered for a while. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) finally stopped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) still heard whimpering. It
was faint, and it was coming from somewhere farther
up the road.
``How long has it been?'' Muldoon said, coming back i
nto the control room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) was carrying a
black metal case.
``Half an hour.''
``Harding's Jeep should he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) back here by now.''
Arnold stubbed out his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) cigarette. ``I'm sure they'll
arrive any minute now.
<div class="bookquote">``Still no sign of Nedry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
<div class="bookquote">``No. Not yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon opened the case, which contained six portab
le radios. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to distribute these to
people in the building.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) handed one to Arnold. <div class="bookquote">''
Take the charger, too. These are our
emergency radios, but nobody had them plugged in, n
aturally. Let it charge about twenty
minutes, and then try and raise the cars.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Henry Wu opened the door marked FERTILIZATION and e
ntered the darkened lab. There was
nobody here; apparently all the technicians were st
ill at dinner. Wu went directly to the computer
terminal and punched up the DNA logbooks. The logbo
oks had to be kept on computer. DNA was
such a large molecule that each species required te
n gigabytes of optical disk space to store
details of all the iterations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) was going to have
to check all fifteen species. That was a
tremendous amount of information to search through.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) still wasn't clear about why Grant thought frog
DNA was important. Wu himself didn't often
distinguish one kind of DNA from another. After all
, most DNA in living creatures was exactly the
same. DNA was an incredibly ancient substance. Huma
n beings, walking around in the streets of
the modern world, bouncing their pink new babies, h
ardly stopped to think that the substance at
the center of it all-the substance that began the d
ance of life-was a chemical almost as old as the
earth itself. The DNA molecule was so old that its
evolution had essentially finished more than
two billion years ago. There had been little new si
nce that time. Just a few recent combinations of
the old genes-and not much of that.
When you compared the DNA of man and the DNA of a l
owly bacterium, you found that only
about 10 percent of the strands were different. Thi
s innate conservatism of DNA emboldened Wu
to use whatever DNA he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) wished. In making his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) dinosa
urs, Wu had manipulated the DNA as a
sculptor might clay or marble. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) had created freel
y.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) started the computer search program, knowing it
would take two or three minutes to run.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) got up and walked around the lab, checking instr
uments out of long-standing habit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) noted
the recorder outside the freezer door, which tracke
d the freezer temperature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) saw there was a
spike in the graph. That was odd, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) thought. It me
ant somebody had been in the freezer.
Recently, too-witbin the last half-hour. But who wo
uld go in there at night?
The computer beeped, signaling that the first of th
e data searches was complete. Wu went
over to see what it had found, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) saw the
screen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) forgot all about the freezer and
the graph spike.

The result was clear: all breeding dinosaurs incorp
orated rana, or frog, DNA. None of the other
animals did. Wu still did not understand why this h
ad caused them to breed. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) could no
longer deny that Grant was right. The dinosaurs wer
e breeding.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) hurried up to the control room.
Lex
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) was curled up inside a big one-meter drainage p
ipe that ran under the road. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>)
baseball glove in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) mouth and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) was rocking bac
k and forth, banging her (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) head repeatedly
against the back of the pipe. It was dark in there,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) clearly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) goggles.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) seemed unhurt, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) felt a great burst of rel
ief.
<div class="bookquote">``Lex, it's me. Tim.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) didn't answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) continued to bang her (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) head o
n the pipe. <div class="bookquote">``Come on out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) head no. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) could see she (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) was badly f
rightened.
<div class="bookquote">``Lex,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if you come out, I'll let you wear
these night goggles.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) just shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Look what I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) said, holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) band. S
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) stared uncomprehendingly. It was
probably too dark for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) to see. <div class="bookquote">``It's your ball,
Lex. I found your ball.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So what.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) tried another approach. <div class="bookquote">``It must be uncomfortabl
e in there. Cold, too. Wouldn't you like to
come out?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) resumed banging her (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) head against the pipe.
<div class="bookquote">``Why not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There's aminals out there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>That threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) for a moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) hadn't said <div class="bookquote">``amina
ls''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>for years.
<div class="bookquote">``The aminals are gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``There's a big one. A Tyrannosaurus rex.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)'s gone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where did he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) go?''

aid, hoping it was true.
Lex didn't move. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) hanging again. Tim sa
t down in the grass outside the pipe,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>). The ground was wet where h
e sat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) hugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) knees and waited.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) couldn't think of anything else to do. <div class="bookquote">``I'm just
going to sit here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And rest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is Daddy out there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said, feeling strange. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)'s back at home,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is Mommy?''

<div class="bookquote">``Not yet. But I'm sure they'll come soon. They're p

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) moving inside the pipe, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) c
ame out. Shivering with cold, and with
dried blood on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) forehead, but otherwise all righ
t.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) looked around in surprise and said, <div class="bookquote">``Where's Dr

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was here before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) when I was in the pi

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How am I supposed to know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, wrinkling he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
r nose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) began to shout: <div class="bookquote">``Hellooo.
Hell-oooo! Dr. Grant? Dr. Grant!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Tim was uneasy at the noise she (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) was making-it might
bring back the tyrannosaur-but a
moment later he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) heard an answering shout. It was co
ming from the right, over toward the Land
Cruiser that Tim had left a few minutes before. Wit
h his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) goggles, Tim saw with relief that Dr.
Grant was walking toward them, He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had a big tear in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) shirt at the shoulder, but otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
looked okay.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank God,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I've been looking for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ed Regis/Regis/Ed</b></font>)</div>Shivering, Ed Regis got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) feet, and wiped the
cold mud off his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) face and hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) had spent a
very had half hour, wedged among big boulders on th
e slope of a hill below the road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) knew it
wasn't much of a hiding place, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) was panicked
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) wasn't thinking clearly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) had lain in
this muddy cold place and he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) had tried to get hold
of himself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) kept seeing that dinosaur in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) mind. That dinosaur coming toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>). Toward t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) car.
Ed Regis didn't remember exactly what had happened
after that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) remembered that Lex had
said something but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) hadn't stopped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) couldn't s
top, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had just kept running and running.
Beyond the road he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) footing and tumbled
down the hill and come to rest by some
boulders, and it had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) could cr
awl in among the boulders, and hide, there
was enough room, so that was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had done. Gasp
ing and terrified, thinking of nothing
except to get away from the tyrannosaur. And, final
ly, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) was wedged in there like a rat
between the boulders, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had calmed down a little,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had been overcome with horror and
shame because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)'d abandoned those kids, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had jus
t run away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had just saved himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) should go back up to the road, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) should tr
y to rescue them, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had always
imagined himself as brave and cool under pressure,
but whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) tried to get control of
himself, to make himself go back up there-somehow h
e just couldn't. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) started to feel panicky,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had trouble breathing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) didn't move.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) told himself it was hopeless, anyway. If the kid
s were still up there on the road they could
never survive, and certainly there was nothing Ed R
egis could do for them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) might as well
stay where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) was. No one was going to know what ha
d happened except him (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>). And there was
nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) could do. Nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) could have done. An
d so Regis had remained among the
boulders for half an hour, fighting off panic, care
fully not thinking about whether the kids had died,

<p/>or about what Hammond would have to say when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) fou
nd out.
What finally made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) move was the peculiar sensati
on he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) noticed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) mouth. The side of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) mouth felt funny, kind of numb and tingling, an
d he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) had hurt it during the fall.
Regis touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) face and felt swollen flesh on th
e side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) mouth. It was funny, but it didn't
hurt at all. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) realized the swollen flesh was
a leech growing fat as it sucked his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) lips. It was
practically in his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) mouth. Shivering with nausea, Re
gis pulled the leech away, feeling it tear from
the flesh of his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) lips, feeling the gush of warm blo
od in his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) spat, and flung it with disgust

<p/>into the forest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) saw another leech on his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) forear
m, and pulled it off, leaving a dark bloody
streak behind. Jesus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was probably covered with
them. That fall down the hillside. These
jungle hills were full of leeches. So were the dark
rocky crevices. What did the workmen say?
The leeches crawled up your underwear. They liked d
ark warm places. They liked to crawl right
up your-
<div class="bookquote">``Hellooo!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) stopped. It was a voice, carried by the wind.
<div class="bookquote">``Helloo! Dr. Grant!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jesus/Christ/Jesus Christ</b></font>)</div>Jesus, that was the little girl.
Ed Regis listened to the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did
n't sound frightened, or in pain. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was just
calling in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) insistent way. And it slowly dawned
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) that something else must have
happened, that the tyrannosaur must have gone away-
or at least hadn't attacked-and that the
other people might still be alive. Grant and Malcol
m. Everybody might be alive. An the realization
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) pull himself together in an instant, the w
ay you got sober in an instant when the cops
pulled you over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) felt better, because now he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had to do. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) crawled
out from the boulders he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was already formulating th
e next step, already figuring out what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
would say, how to handle things from this point.
Regis wiped the cold mud off his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) face and hands, th
e evidence that he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) had been hiding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>)
wasn't embarrassed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) had been hiding, but now
he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) had to take charge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) scrambled back
up toward the road, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) emerged from the fo
liage he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) had a moment of disorientation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>)
didn't see the cars at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) was somehow at the b
ottom of the hill. The Land Cruisers must be at
the top.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) started walking up the hill, back toward the Lan
d Cruisers. It was very quiet. His (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) feet
splashed in the muddy puddles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) couldn't bear the
little girl any more. Why had she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stopped
calling? As he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) walked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) began to think that maybe
something had happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). In that
case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) shouldn't walk back there. Maybe the tyran
nosaur was still hanging around. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>)
was, already at the bottom of the hill. That much c
loser to home.
And it was so quiet. Spooky, it was so quiet.
Ed Regis turned around, and started walking back to
ward the camp.
Alan Grant ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) limbs, squeezing
the arms and legs briefly. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) didn't seem to
have any pain. It was amazing: aside from a cut on
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was fine. <div class="bookquote">``I told you I was,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
said.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I had to check.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div>The boy was not quite so fortunate. Tim's nose was
swollen and painful; Grant suspected it
was broken. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) right shoulder was badly bruised an
d swollen. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) legs seemed to be all
right. Both kids could walk. That was the important
thing.
Grant himself was all right except for a claw abras
ion down his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) right chest, where the
tyrannosaur had kicked him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). It burned with every br
eath, but it didn't seem to be serious, and it
didn't limit his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) movement.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had been knocked unconscious, bec
ause he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had only dim recollections of
events immediately preceding the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had sat
up, groaning, in the woods ten yards from
the Land Cruiser. At first his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) chest had been bleed
ing, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had stuck leaves on the wound, and
after a while it clotted. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had started walki
ng around, looking for Malcolm and the kids.
Grant couldn't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was still alive, and as s
cattered images began to come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
tried to make sense of them. The tyrannosaur should
have killed them all easily. Why hadn't it?
<div class="bookquote">``I'm hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``Me, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``We've got to get ourselves
back to civilization. And we've got to tell
them about the ship.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We're the only ones who know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said. ``Yes.

<p/>We've got to get back and tell them.''
``Then let's walk down the road toward the hotel,'' T
im said, pointing down the hill. ``That way
we'll meet them when they come for us.''
Grant considered that. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) kept thinking about o
ne thing: the dark shape that had crossed
between the Land Cruisers even before the attack st
arted. What animal had that been? He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could
think of only one possibility-the little tyrannosau
r.
``I don't think so, Tim. The road has high fences on
both sides,'' Grant said. ``If one of the
tyrannosaurs is farther down on the road, we'll he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
trapped.''
``Then should we wait here?'' Tim said.
``Yes,'' Grant said. ``Let's just wait here until some
one comes.'' ``I'm
hungry,'' Lex said.
``I hope it won't be very long,'' Grant said. ``I

<p/>don't want to stay here,'' Lex said.
Then, from the bottom of the hill, they heard the s
ound of a man coughing.
``Stay here,'' Grant said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) ran forward, to look do
wn the hill. ``Stay here,'' Tim
said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) ran forward after him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>).
Lex followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) brother. ``Don't leave me, don't le
ave me here, you guys-''
Grant clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) band over her (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) mouth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) struggle
d to protest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head, and
pointed over the hill, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) to look.
At the bottom of the hill, Grant saw Ed Regis, stan
ding rigid, unmoving. The forest around them
had become deadly silent. The steady background dro
ne of cicadas and frogs had ceased
abruptly. There was only the faint rustle of leaves
, and the whine of the wind,
Lex started to speak, but Grant pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) against
the trunk of the nearest tree, ducking down
among the heavy gnarled roots at the base. Tim came
in right after them. Grant put his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) hands to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) lips, signaling them to be quiet, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) s
lowly looked around the tree.
The road below was dark, and as the branches of the
big trees moved in the wind, the
moonlight filtering through made a dappled, shiftin
g pattern. Ed Regis was gone. It took Grant a
moment to locate him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). The publicist was pressed up
against the trunk of a big tree, hugging it.
Regis wasn't moving at all.
The forest remained silent.
Lex tugged impatiently at Grant's shirt; she (<font color='blue'><b>publicist</b></font>) wanted
to know what was happening. Then, from
somewhere very near, they heard a soft snorting exh
alation, hardly louder than the wind. Lex
heard it, too, because she (<font color='blue'><b>publicist</b></font>) stopped struggling.
The sound floated toward them again, soft as a sigh
. Grant thought it was almost like the
breathing of a horse.
Grant looked at Regis, and saw the moving shadows c
ast by the moonlight on the trunk of the
tree. And then Grant realized there was another sha
dow, superimposed on the others, but not
moving: a strong curved neck, and a square head.
The exhalation came again.
Tim leaned forward cautiously, to look. Lex did, to
o.
They heard a crack as a branch broke, and into the
path stepped a tyrannosaur. It was the
juvenile: about eight feet tall, and it moved with
the clumsy gait of a young animal, almost like a
puppy. The juvenile tyrannosaur shuffled down the p
ath, stopping with every step to sniff the air
before moving on. It passed the tree where Regis wa
s hiding, and gave no indication that it had
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>). Grant saw Regis's body relax slightly. Re
gis turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head, trying to watch the
tyrannosaur on the far side of the tree.
The tyrannosaur was now out of view down the road.
Regis started to relax, releasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) grip
on the tree. But the jungle remained silent. Regis
remained close to the tree trunk for another half
a minute. Then the sounds of the forest returned: t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) first tentative croak of a tree frog, the buzz
of one cicada, and then the full chorus. Regis step
ped away from the tree, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) shoulders,
releasing the tension. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) walked into the middle of
the road, looking in the direction of the
departed tyrannosaur.
The attack came from the left.
The juvenile roared as it swung its head forward, k
nocking Regis flat to the ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) yelled
and scrambled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) feet, but the tyrannosaur poun
ced, and it must have pinned him (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) with its hind
leg, because suddenly Regis wasn't moving, he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) was s
itting up in the path shouting at the
dinosaur and waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) hands at it, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) could
scare it off. The young dinosaur seemed
perplexed by the sounds and movement coming from it
s tiny prey. The juvenile bent its head
over, sniffing curiously, and Regis pounded on the
snout with his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) fists.
``Get away! Back off! Go on, back off!'' Regis was sh
outing at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) lungs, and the
dinosaur backed away, allowing Regis to get to his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>)
feet. Regis was shouting ``Yeah! You heard
me! Back off! Get away!'' as he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) moved away from the
dinosaur. The juvenile continued to stare
curiously at the odd, noisy little animal before it
, but when Regis had gone a few paces, it lunged
and knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) down again.
It's playing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>), Grant thought.
``Hey!'' Regis shouted as he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) fell, but the juvenile d
id not pursue him (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>), allowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) to get to his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>)
feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) jumped to his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) feet, and continued backing
away. ``You stupid-back! Back! You heard me-
back!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) shouted like a lion tamer.
The juvenile roared, but it did not attack, and Reg
is now edged toward the trees and high
foliage to the right. In another few steps he (<font color='blue'><b>Reg</b></font>) would
be in hiding. ``Back! You! Back!'' Regis shouted,
and then, at the last moment the juvenile pounced,
and knocked Regis flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) back. ``Cut that
out'', Regis yelled, and the juvenile ducked his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) hea
d, and Regis began to scream. No words, just a
high-pitched scream.
The scream cut off abruptly, and when the juvenile
lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>) head, Grant saw ragged flesh in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) jaws.
``Oh no,'' Lex said, softly. Beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Regis</b></font>), Tim had turn
ed away, suddenly nauseated. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) night-
vision goggles slipped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) forehead and landed
on the ground with a metallic clink.
The juvenile's head snapped up, and it looked towar
d the top of the hill.
Tim picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) goggles as Grant grabbed both the
children's hands and began to run.
Control
In the night, the compys scurried along the side of
the road. Harding's Jeep followed a short
distance behind. Ellie pointed farther up the road.
``Is that a light?''
``Could be,'' Harding said. ``Looks almost like headli
ghts.<div class="bookquote">''
The radio suddenly bummed and crackled. They heard
John Arnold say,
'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-you there?''
``Ah, there he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is,'' Harding said. ``Finally.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) pres
sed the button. ``Yes, John, we're here. We're

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What'd he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``Something about a car,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said. At Grant's dig

the radiophone. After years of experience, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) had
become skilled at picking up garbled

 (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Harding shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``John's frequently got a problem.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) turned the radio off, and turned the car around.
<div class="bookquote">``I just wish I understood what the urgency is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Harding put the Jeep in gear, and they rumbled down
the road in the darkness. It was another
ten minutes before they saw the welcoming lights of
the Safari Lodge. And as Harding pulled to a
stop in front of the visitor center, they saw Muldo
on coming toward them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was shouting, and
waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) arms.
<div class="bookquote">``God damn it, Arnold, you son of a bitch! God damn
it, get this park back on track! Now! Get my
grandkids back here! Now!''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Hammond</b></font>)</div>John Hammond stood in th
e control room, screaming and stamping
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) little feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) had been carrying on this way f
or the last two minutes, while Henry Wu stood in
the corner, looking stunned.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Hammond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said, <div class="bookquote">``Muldoon's on his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>)
way out right now, to do exactly that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold turned away, and lit another cigarette. Hamm
ond was like every other management guy
Arnold had ever seen. Whether it was Disney or the
Navy, management guys always behaved
the same. They never understood the technical issue
s; and they thought that screaming was the
way to make things happen. And maybe it was, if you
were shouting at your secretaries to get
you a limousine.
But screaming didn't make any difference at all to
the problems that Arnold now faced. The
computer didn't care if it was screamed at. The pow
er network didn't care if it was screamed at.
Technical systems were completely indifferent to al
l this explosive human emotion. If anything,
screaming was counterproductive, because Arnold now
faced the virtual certainty that Nedry
wasn't coming back, which meant that Arnold himself
had to go into the computer code and try
and figure out what had gone wrong. It was going to
be a painstaking job, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)'d need to be calm
and careful.
<div class="bookquote">``Why don't you go downstairs to the cafeteria,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Arn

Arnold was no longer operating the computer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) had
now gone behind the scenes to look at
the code-the line-by-line instructions that told th
e computer how to behave. Arnold was unhappily
aware that the complete Jurassic Park program conta
ined more than half a million lines of code,
most of it undocumented, without explanation.
Wu came forward. <div class="bookquote">``What are you doing, John?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Checking the code.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>The Road
Muldoon took the curve very fast, the Jeep sliding
on the mud. Sitting beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>), Gennaro
clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) fists. They were racing along the clif
f road, high above the river, now hidden below
them in darkness. Muldoon accelerated forward. His (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>)
face was tense.
<div class="bookquote">``How much farther?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``Two, maybe three

 (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie and Harding were back at the visitor center.
Gennaro had offered to accompany Muldoon.
The car swerved. <div class="bookquote">``It's been an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
<div class="bookquote">``An hour, with no word from the other cars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So would I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
Gennaro shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``You really think something

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Chances are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said, <div class="bookquote">``that they're perfectl
y fine, but I'll he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) happier when I finally see
them. Should be any minute now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>The road curved, and then ran up a hill. At the bas
e of the hill Gennaro saw something white,
lying among the ferns by the side of the road. <div class="bookquote">``Hol
d it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said, and Muldoon braked.
Gennaro jumped out and ran forward in the headlight
s of the Jeep to see what it was. It looked
like a piece of clothing, but there was-
Gennaro stopped.
Even from six feet away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) could see clearly what
it was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) walked forward more slowly.
Muldoon leaned out of the car and said, <div class="bookquote">``What is it
?''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's
a leg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
The flesh of the leg was pale blue-wbite, terminati
ng in a ragged bloody stump where the knee
had been. Below the calf he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) saw a white sock, and a
brown slip-on shoe. It was the kind of sboe
Ed Regis had been wearing.
By then Muldoon was out of the car, running past hi
m to crouch over the leg. <div class="bookquote">``Jesus.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) lifted
the leg out of the foliage, raising it into the lig
ht of the headlamps, and blood from the stump
gushed down over his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) band. Gennaro was still three
feet away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) quickly bent over, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) knees, squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) eyes shut, and bre
athed deeply, trying not to be sick.
<div class="bookquote">``Gennaro.''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon's voice was sharp.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Move. You're blocking the light.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro took a breath, and moved. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) opened hi
s eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) saw Muldoon peering
critically at the stump. <div class="bookquote">``Torn at the joint line,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said, <div class="bookquote">``Didn't bite it-twisted and ripped it
.
Just ripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) leg off.''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon stood up, holding
the severed leg upside down so the remaining
blood dripped onto the ferns. His (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) bloody hand smudg
ed the white sock as fie gripped the ankle.
Gennaro felt sick again.
<div class="bookquote">``No question what happened,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon was saying. <div class="bookquote">``T
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) T-rex got him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon looked up
the hill, then back to Gennaro. <div class="bookquote">``You all right? Can
you go on?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``I can go on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon was walking back toward the Jeep, carrying
the leg. <div class="bookquote">``I guess we better bring this
along,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Doesn't seem right to leave it he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
re. Christ, it's going to make a mess of the car.
See if there's anything in the back, will you? A ta
rp or newspaper ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro opened the back door and rummaged around in
the space behind the rear seat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
felt grateful to think about something else for a m
oment. The problem of how to wrap the severed
leg expanded to fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) mind, crowding out all oth
er thoughts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) found a canvas bag with a tool
kit, a wheel rim, a cardboard box, and-
<div class="bookquote">``Two tarps,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) said. They were neatly folded plast
ic.
<div class="bookquote">``Give me one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said, still standing outside
the car. Muldoon wrapped the leg and
passed the now shapeless bundle to Gennaro. Holding
it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) hand, Gennaro was surprised at
how heavy it felt. <div class="bookquote">``Just put it in the back,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Muldo
on said. <div class="bookquote">``If there's a way to wedge it, you know,
so it doesn't roll around ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro put the bundle in the back, and Mul
doon got behind the wheel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
accelerated, the wheels spinning in the mud, then d
igging in. The Jeep rushed up the hill, and for
a moment at the top the headlights still pointed up
ward into the foliage, and then they swung
down, and Gennaro could see the road before them.
<div class="bookquote">``Jesus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
Gennaro saw a single Land Cruiser, lying on its sid
e in the center of the road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) couldn't see
the second Land Cruiser at all. <div class="bookquote">``Where's the other
car?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon looked around briefly, pointed to the left.
<div class="bookquote">``There.''  (<font color='red'><b>Land Cruiser/Cruiser</b></font>)</div>The second Land Cruiser was
twenty feet away, crumpled at the foot of a tree.
<div class="bookquote">``What's it doing there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The T-rex threw it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Threw it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
Muldoon's face was grim. <div class="bookquote">``Let's get this over with,
''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) said, climbing out of the Jeep. They
hurried forward to the second Land Cruiser. Their f
lashlights swung back and forth in the night.
As they came closer, Gennaro saw how battered the c
ar was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) was careful to let Muldoon
look inside first.
<div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't worry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``It's very unlike
ly we'll find anyone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) explained that, during his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) years
in Africa, he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) had visited the scenes of a half-
dozen animal attacks on humans in the bush. One leo
pard attack: the leopard had torn open a
tent in the night and taken a three-year-old child.
Then one buffalo attack in Amboseli; two lion
attacks; one croc attack in the north, near Meru. I
n every case, there was surprisingly little
evidence left behind.
Inexperienced people imagined horrific proofs of an
animal attack-torn limbs left behind in the
tent, trails of dripping blood leading away into th
e bush, bloodstained clothing not far from the
campsite. But the truth was, there was usually noth
ing at all, particularly if the victim was small,
an infant or a young child. The person just seemed
to disappear, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) had walked out into the
bush and never come back. A predator could kill a c
hild just by shaking it, snapping the neck.
Usually there wasn't any blood.
And most of the time you never found any other rema
ins of the victims. Sometimes a button
from a shirt, or a sliver of rubber from a shoe. Bu
t most of the time, nothing.
Predators took children-they preferred children-and
they left nothing behind. So Muldoon
thought it highly unlikely that they would ever fin
d any remains of the children.
But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) looked in now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) had a surprise. <div class="bookquote">``I'll b
e damned,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said.
Muldoon tried to put the scene together. The front
windshield of the Land Cruiser was shattered,
but there wasn't much glass nearby. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) had noticed
shards of glass back on the road. So the
windshield must have broken back there, before the
tyrannosaur picked the car up and threw it
here. But the car had taken a tremendous beating. M
uldoon shone his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) light inside.
<div class="bookquote">``Empty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gcnnaro</b></font>)</div>Gcnnaro said, tensely.
<div class="bookquote">``Not quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. His (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) flashlight glinted o
ff a Crushed radio handset, and on the floor of
the car he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) saw something else, something curved and
black. The front doors were dented and
jammed shut, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) climbed in through the back doo
r and crawled over the seat to pick up the
black object.
<div class="bookquote">``It's a watch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said, peering at it in the beam
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) flashlight. A cheap digital watch with a
molded black rubber strap. The LCD face was shatter
ed, He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) thought the boy might have been
wearing it, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) wasn't sure. But it was the k
ind of watch a kid would have.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it, a watch?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes. And there's a radio, but it's broken.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that significant?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. And there's something else... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon s
niffed. There was a sour odor inside the car.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) shone the light around until he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) saw the vomit dr
ipping off the side door panel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) touched it:
still fresh. <div class="bookquote">``One of the kids may still be alive,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
Gennaro squinted at him (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What makes you think so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The watch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``The watch proves it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>H
e banded the watch to Gennaro, who held
it in the glow of the flashlight, and turned it ove
r in his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) hands.
<div class="bookquote">``Crystal is cracked,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``And the band is unin
jured.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Which means?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The kid took it off,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That could have happened anytime,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">''
Anytime before the attack.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``Those LCD crystals are tough.
It takes a powerful blow to break them.
The watch face was shattered during the attack.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So the kid took his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) watch off.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Think about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``If you were being
attacked by a tyrannosaur, would you stop to
take your watch off?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe it was torn off.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's almost impossible to tear a watch off somebod

Anyway, the band is intact. No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``The
kid took it off himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>)
watch, saw it was broken, and took it off. He (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) had t
he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) time to do that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It could only have been after the attack,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon
said. <div class="bookquote">``The kid must have been in this car,
after the attack. And the radio was broken, so he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) l
eft it behind, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>)'s a bright kid, and he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) knew
they weren't useful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>)'s so bright,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said, <div class="bookquote">``where'd he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) go?
Because I'd stay right here and wait to be
picked up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``But perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) couldn't stay
here. May the tyrannosaur came back. Or
some other animal. Anyway, something made him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) leave
.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then where'd he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said,
<div class="bookquote">``Let's see if we can determine that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) strode off toward the main road.
Gennaro watched Muldoon peering at the ground with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) flashlight. His (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) face was just inches
from the mud, intent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) search. Muldoon really
believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) was on to something, that at least
one of the kids was still alive. Gennaro remained u
nimpressed. The shock of finding the severed
leg had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) with a grim determination to close
the park, and destroy it. No matter what
Muldoon said, Gennaro suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) of unwarranted
enthusiasm, and hopefulness, and-
<div class="bookquote">``You notice these prints?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Muldoon asked, still loo
king at the ground. <div class="bookquote">``What prints?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro
said.
``These footprints-see them, coming toward us from u
p the road?-and they're adult-size prints.
Some kind of rubber-sole sboe. Notice the distincti
ve tread pattern.
Gennaro saw only mud. Puddles catching the light fr
om the flashlights.
``You can see,'' Muldoon continued, ``the adult prints
come to here, where they're joined by
other prints. Small, and medium-size ... moving a
round in circles, overlapping ... almost as if
they're standing together, talking... . But now h
ere they are, they seem to be running. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) pointed
off. <div class="bookquote">``There. Into the park.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``You can see whatever you w
ant in this mud.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) feet and stepped back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) looked
down at the ground and sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Say
what you like, I'll wager one of the kids survived.
And maybe both. Perhaps even an adult as well,
if these big prints belong to someone other than Re
gis, We've got to search the park.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tonight?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
But Muldoon wasn't listening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) had walked away, t
oward an embankment of soft earth, near
a drainpipe for rain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) crouched again. <div class="bookquote">``What was
that little girl wearing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Christ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Proceeding slowly, Muldoon moved farther toward the
side of the road. And then they heard a
wheezing sound. It was definitely an animal sound.
<div class="bookquote">``Listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said, feeling panic, <div class="bookquote">``I think we
better-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shhh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) paused, listening.
<div class="bookquote">``It's just the wind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
They heard the wheezing again, distinctly this time
. It wasn't the wind. It was coming from the
foliage directly ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>), by the side of the r
oad. It didn't sound like an animal, but Muldoon
moved forward cautiously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) waggled his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) light and
shouted, but the wheezing did not change
character. Muldoon pushed aside the fronds of a pal
m.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>pal</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said,
<div class="bookquote">``It's Malcolm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
Ian Malcolm lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) skin gray-white, m
outh slackly open. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) breath came in
wheezing gasps. Muldoon handed the flashlight to Ge
nnaro, and then bent to examine the body.
<div class="bookquote">``I can't find the injury,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Head okay, che
st, arms ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Then Gennaro shone the light on the legs. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) put a
tourniquet on.''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm's belt was twisted
tight over the right thigh. Gennaro moved the light
down the leg. The right ankle was bent
outward at an awkward angle from the leg, the trous
ers flattened, soaked in blood. Muldoon
touched the ankle gently, and Malcolm groaned.
Muldoon stepped back and tried to decide what to do
next. Malcolm might have other injuries.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) back might be broken. It might kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) to move
him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>). But if they left him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) would die of
shock. It was only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) had had the presence
of mind to put a tourniquet on that he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) hadn't
already bled to death. And probably he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) was doomed.
They might as well move him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>).
Gennaro helped Muldoon pick the man up, hoisting hi
m awkwardly over their shoulders.
Malcolm moaned, and breathed in ragged gasps. <div class="bookquote">``Lex,
''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Lex ... went ... Lex ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who's Lex?''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
<div class="bookquote">``The little girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. They carried Malco
lm back to the Jeep, and wrested him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) into the
back seat. Gennaro tightened the tourniquet around
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) leg. Malcolm groaned again. Muldoon
slid the trouser cuff up and saw the pulpy flesh be
neath, the dull white splinters of protruding
bone.
<div class="bookquote">``We've got to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
<div class="bookquote">``You going to leave here without the kids?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro
said.
<div class="bookquote">``If they went into the park, it's twenty square mil
es,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``The only
way we can find anything out there is with the moti

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then we have to go back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They climbed into the car. Gennaro said, <div class="bookquote">``Are you g

 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``You are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Control
Donald Gennaro stared at Hammond, sitting in the de
serted cafeteria. The man was spooning ice
cream, calmly eating it. <div class="bookquote">``So Muldoon believes the c
hildren are somewhere in the park?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) thinks so, yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) watched the old man d
eliberately eating, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) felt a chill.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am sure we'll find them. After all, I keep t
elling everyone, this park is made for kids.''

<div class="bookquote">``Because I think Nedry did something to the code,''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I sure as hell can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) started to pr
ess buttons. Why hadn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) thought of it
before? It was so obvious. The computer system at J
urassic Park had several tiers of safety
systems built into it. One of them was a keycheck p
rogram, which monitored all the keystrokes
entered by operators with access to the system. It
was originally installed as a debugging device,
but it was retained for its security value.
In a moment, all the keystrokes that Nedry had ente
red into the computer earlier in the day
were listed in a window on the screen:

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The initial list of numbers represented the ASCI ke
yboard codes for the keys Nedry had
pushed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) console. Those numbers meant he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) was s
till within the standard user interface, like
any ordinary user of the computer. So initially Ned
ry was just looking around, which you wouldn't
have expected of the programmer who had designed th

<div class="bookquote">``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was trying to see if there were changes,

<div class="bookquote">``Maybe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. Arnold was now looking at the
list of commands, which allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) to
follow Nedry's progression through the system, line
by line. <div class="bookquote">``At least we can see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) did.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>system was Nedry's request to leave the ordinary us
er interface and access the code itself.
The computer asked for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) name, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) replied: ne
dry.
That name was authorized to access the code, so the
computer allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) into the system.
Nedry asked to goto command level, the computer's h
ighest level of control. The command level
required extra security, and asked Nedry for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) na
me, access number 7 and password.

Those entries got Nedry into the command level. Fro
m there he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) wanted security. And since he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)
was authorized, the computer allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) to go ther
e. Once at the security level, Nedry tried
three variations:
keycheck off
safety off

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>After three failed commands, the computer automatic
ally began to worry about Nedry. But
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) had gotten in with proper authorization, t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) computer would assume that Nedry was
lost, trying to do something he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) couldn't accomplish
from where he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) was. So the computer asked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) again where he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) wanted to be, and Nedry said:
security. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) was allowed to remain there.
<div class="bookquote">``Finally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said, <div class="bookquote">``here's the kicker.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) pointed

Ellie was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) room, about to change out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) w
et clothes, when there was a knock on the
door.
``Alan?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) opened the door she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
saw Muldoon standing there, with a
plastic-wrapped package under his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) arm. Muldoon was
also soaking wet, and there were streaks of
dirt on his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) clothes.
``I'm sorry, but we need your help,'' Muldoon said br
iskly. ``The Land Cruisers were attacked an
hour ago. We brought Malcolm back, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>)'s in shoc

``Harding?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said. ``What about the others?''
``We haven't found the others yet, Dr. Sattler,'' Mul

``Oh, my God.''
``But we think that Dr. Grant and the children are s

<div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing. Just go to Malcolm's room, and help Hardi

Muldoon was gone.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) sat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) bed, shocked. Ellie Sattler was not
a woman disposed to unnecessary panic,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) had known Grant to get out of dangerous sit
uations before. Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)'d been lost in the
badlands for four days when a cliff gave way beneat
h him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) truck fell a hundred feet into a
ravine. Grant's right leg was broken. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had no wat
er. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) walked back on a broken leg.
On the other hand, the kids ...
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) head, pushing the thought away. The k
ids were probably with Grant. And if
Grant was out in the park, well ... what better p
erson to get them safely through Jurassic Park
than a dinosaur expert?
In the Park
<div class="bookquote">``I'm tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``Carry me, Dr. Grant.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'

<div class="bookquote">``But I'm tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay, Lex,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said, picking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) up. <div class="bookquote">``Oof, you'
re heavy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was almost 9:00 p.m.. The full moon was blurred b
y drifting mist, and their blunted shadows
led them across an open field, toward dark woods be
yond. Grant was lost in thought, trying to
decide where he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was. Since they had originally cros
sed over the fence that the tyrannosaur had
battered down, Grant was reasonably sure they were
now somewhere in the tyrannosaur
paddock. Which was a place he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) did not want to be. I
n his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) kept seeing the computer
tracing of the tyrannosaur's home range, the tight
squiggle of lines that traced his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) movements
within a small area. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) and the kids were in that a
rea now.
But Grant also remembered that the tyrannosaurs wer
e isolated from all the other animals,
which meant they would know they had left the paddo
ck when they crossed a barrier-a fence, or a
moat, or both.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had seen no barriers, so far.
The girl put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) shoulder, and twirled
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fingers. Soon she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
snoring. Tim trudged alongside Grant.
<div class="bookquote">``How you holding up, Tim?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But I think we might be in the ty
rannosaur area.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm pretty sure we are. I hope we get out soon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You going to go into the woods?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said. As they
came closer, the woods seemed dark and
forbidding.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``I think we can navigate by the
numbers on the motion sensors.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The motion sensors were green boxes set about four
feet off the ground. Some were
freestanding; most were attached to trees. None of
them were working, because apparently the
power was still off. Each sensor box had a glass le
ns mounted in the center, and a painted code
number beneath that. Up ahead, in the mist-streaked
moonlight, Grant could see a box marked
T/S/04.
They entered the forest. Huge trees loomed on all s
ides. In the moonlight, a low mist clung to
the ground, curling around the roots of the trees.
It was beautiful, but it made walking
treacherous. And Grant was watching the sensors. Th
ey seemed to be numbered in descending
order. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) passed T/S/03, and T/S/02. Eventually the
y reached T/S/01. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was tired from carrying
the girl, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had hoped this would coincide with
a boundary for the tyrannosaur paddock, but it
was just another box in the middle of the woods. Th
e next box after that was marked T/N/01,
followed by T/N/02. Grant realized the numbers must
be arranged geographically around a
central point, like a compass. They were going from
soutb to north, so the numbers got smaller
as they approached the center, then got larger agai
n.
<div class="bookquote">``At least we're going the right way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
Tim smiled, and stumbled over vines in the mist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
got quickly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) feet. They walked on for
a while. <div class="bookquote">``My parents are getting a divorce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sai
d.
<div class="bookquote">``Uh-huh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
``My dad moved out last month. He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) own place
in Mill Valley now.
``Uh-huh.''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) never carries my sister any more. He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) never even
picks her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) up.''
``And he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) says you have dinosaurs on the brain,'' Gran
t said.
Tim sighed. ``Yeah.''
``You miss him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)?'' Grant said.
``Not really,'' Tim said. ``Sometimes. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) misses him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)
more.''
``Who, your mother?''
``No, Lex. My mom has a boyfriend. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) fro
m work.''
They walked in silence for a while, passing T/N/03
and T/N/04. ``Have you met him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)?'' Grant
said.
``Yeah.''
``How is he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)'s okay,'' Tim said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)'s younger than my dad, b
ut he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)'s bald.''
``How does he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) treat you?''
``I don't know. Okay. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) just tries to get o
n my good side. I don't know what's going to
happen. Sometimes my mom says we'll have to sell th
e house and move. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) and my
mom fight, late at night. I sit in my room and play
with my computer, but I can still hear it.''
``Uh-huh,'' Grant said.
``Are you divorced?''
``No,'' Grant said. ``My wife died a long time ago.''
``And now you're with Dr. Sattler?''
Grant smiled in the darkness. ``No. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s my student
.''
``You mean she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s still in school?''
``Graduate school, yes.<div class="bookquote">'' Grant paused long enough to
shift Lex to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) other shoulder, and then
they continued on, past T/N/05 and T/N/06. There wa
s the rumble of thunder in the distance. The
storm had moved to the south. There was very little
sound in the forest except for the drone of
cicadas and the soft croaking of tree frogs.
You have children?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim asked. <div class="bookquote">``No,''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Crant said.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you going to marry Dr. Sattler?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s marrying a nice doctor in Chicago someti
me next year.
``Oh,'' Tim said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) seemed surprised to hear it. The
y walked along for a while. ``Then who are
you going to marry?''
``I don't think I'm going to marry anybody,'' Grant s
aid. ``Me
neither,'' Tim said.
They walked for a while. Tim said, ``Are we going to
walk all night?''
``I don't think I can,'' Grant said. ``We'll have to s
top, at least for a few hours.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
watch. ``We're okay. We've got almost fifteen hours
before we have to be back. Before the ship
reaches the mainland.''
``Where are we going to stop?'' Tim asked, immediatel
y.
Grant was wondering the same thing. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) first thoug
ht was that thev might climb a tree, and
sleep up there. But they would have to climb very h
igh to get safely away from the animals, and
Lex might fall out while she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was asleep. And tree b
ranches were hard; they wouldn't get any rest.
At least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) wouldn't.
They needed someplace really safe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) thought back
to the plans he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had seen on the jet
coming down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) remembered that there were outlying
buildings for each of the different
divisions. Grant didn't know what they were like, b
ecause plans for the individual buildings
weren't included. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) couldn't remember exactly
where they were, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) remembered they
were scattered all around the park. There might be
buildings somewhere nearby.
But that was a different requirement from simply cr
ossing a barrier and getting out of the
tyrannosaur paddock, Finding a building meant a sea
rch strategy of some kind. And the best
strategies were-
``Tim, can you hold your sister for me? I'm going to
climb a tree and have a look around.''
High in the branches, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had a good view of the for
est, the tops of the trees extending away to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) left and right. They were surprisingly near the
edge of the forest-directly ahead the trees
ended before a clearing, with an electrified fence
and a pale concrete moat. Beyond that, a large
open field in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) assumed was the sauropod padd
ock. In the distance, more trees, and misty
moonlight sparkling on the ocean.
Somewhere he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heard the bellowing of a dinosaur, but
it was far away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) put on Tim's night-
vision goggles and looked again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) followed the gr
ay curve of the moat, and then saw what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
was looking for: the dark strip of a service road,
leading to the flat rectangle of a roof. The roof
was barely above ground level, but it was there. An
d it wasn't far. Maybe a quarter of a mile or so
from the tree.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) came back down, Lex was sniffling.
``What's the matter?'' ``I heard

<p/>an aminal.''
``It won't bother us. Are you awake now? Come on.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) to the fence. It was twelve feet high, w
ith a spiral of barbed wire at the top. It
seemed to stretch far above them in the moonligbt.
The moat was immediately on the other side.
Lex looked up at the fence doubtfully. ``Can

<p/>you climb it?'' Grant asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) glove, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) baseball. ``Sure.
Easy.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) started to climb. ``But I bet
Timmy can't.''
Tim spun in fury: ``You shut up.''
``Timmy's afraid of heights.''
``I am not.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) climbed higher. ``Are so.''
``Am not.''
``Then come and get me.''
Grant turned to Tim, pale in the darkness. The boy
wasn't moving. ``You okay with the fence,
Tim?''
``Sure.''
``Want some help?''
``Timmy's a fraidy-cat,'' Lex called.
``What a stupid jerk,'' Tim said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) started to c
limb.
``It's freezing,'' Lex said. They were standing waist
-deep in smelly water at the bottom of a deep
concrete moat. They had climbed the fence without i
ncident, except that Tim had torn his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) shirt on
the coils of barbed wire at the top. Then they had
all slid down into the moat, and now Grant was
looking for a way out.
``At least I got Timmy over the fence for you,'' Lex
said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Timmy</b></font>) really is scared most times.''
``Thanks for your help,'' Tim said sarcastically. In
the moonlight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could see floating lumps on
the surface. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) moved along the moat, looking at th
e concrete wall on the far side. The concrete
was smooth; they couldn't possibly climb it.
``Eww,'' Lex said, pointing to the water.
``It won't hurt you, Lex.''
Grant finally found a place where the concrete had
cracked and a vine grew down toward the
water. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) tugged on the vine, and it held his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) weigh
t. ``Let's go, kids.'' They started to climb the
vine, back to the field above.
It took only a few minutes to cross the field to th
e embankment leading to the below-grade
service road, and the maintenance building off to t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) right. They passed two motion sensors, and
Grant noticed with some uneasiness that the sensors
were still not working, nor were the lights.
More than two hours had passed since the power firs
t went out, and it was not yet restored.
Somewhere in the distance, they heard the tyrannosa
ur roar. ``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) around here?'' Lex said.
``No,'' Grant said. ``We're in another section of park
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>).'' They slid down a grassy
embankment and moved toward the concrete building.
In the darkness it was forbidding, bunker-
like.
``What is this place?'' Lex said.
``It's safe,'' Grant said, hoping that was true.
The entrance gate was large enough to drive a truck
through. It was fitted with heavy bars.
Inside, they could see, the building was an open sh
ed, with piles of grass and bales of bay
stacked among equipment.
The gate was locked with a heavy padlock. As Grant
was examining it, Lex slipped sideways
between the bars. ``Come on, you guys.''
Tim followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). ``I think you can do it, Dr. Grant
.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was right; it was a tight squeeze, but Grant was
able to ease his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) body between the bars
and get into the shed. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was inside, a
wave of exhaustion struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>).
``I wonder if there's anything to eat,'' Lex said.
``Just hay.'' Grant broke open a bale, and spread it
around on the concrete. The hay in the
center was warm. They lay down, feeling the warmth.
Lex curled up beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>), and closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
eyes. Tim put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) arm around her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) heard the saur
opods trumpeting softly in the distance.
Neither child spoke. They were almost immediately s
noring. Grant raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) arm to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
watch, but it was too dark to see. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) felt the warm
th of the children against his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) own body.
Grant closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) eves, and slept.
Control
Muldoon and Gennaro came into the control room just
as Arnold clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) bands and said,
``Got you, you little son of a bitch.''
<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said,

<div class="bookquote">``That's it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said, pleased.
<div class="bookquote">``That's what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro asked, staring at the screen
.
``I finally found the command to restore the origina

``Good,'' Muldoon said.
``But it does something else,'' Arnold said. ``It then

Gennaro shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) head. ``I don't know much about co

Muldoon pointed to the windows. <div class="bookquote">``Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Outside, th

throughout the park, They went to the windows and l
ooked out.
<div class="bookquote">``Hot damn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said,

 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You bet it does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``It'll take a few s

But in half a minute we'll be back in business,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Ar
nold pointed to the vertical glass see-through
map of the park.
On the map, bright red lines were snaking out from
the power station, moving throughout the
park, as electricity surged through the fences.
<div class="bookquote">``And the motion sensors?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, them, too. It'll be a few minutes while the c

 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``Half past nine, and we've got the who
le damn thing back up and running.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) eyes. Brilliant blue light was str
eaming into the building through the bars of the
gate. Quartz light: the power was back on! Groggily
, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) watch. It was just nine-thirty.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)'d been asleep only a couple of minutes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) decid
ed he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) could sleep a few minutes more, and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) would go back up to the field and stand in
front of the motion sensors and wave, setting
them off. The control room would spot him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>); they'd s
end a car out to pick him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) and the kids up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)'d
tell Arnold to recall the supply ship, and they'd a
ll finish the night in their own beds back in the
lodge.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) would do that right away. In just a couple of mi
nutes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) yawned, and closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) eyes
again.
<div class="bookquote">``Not bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said in the control room, staring
at the glowing map. <div class="bookquote">``There's only three cutouts
in the whole park. Much better than I hoped for.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cutouts?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``The fence automatically cuts out short-circuited s

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why would that section be out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``God knows,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``Probably storm damage or
a fallen tree. We can check It on the

the jungle river. Don't know why that should be
out, either.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>As Gennaro looked, the map became more complex, fil

<div class="bookquote">``What's all this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The animals. The motion sensors are working again,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. We've reset our search number above four hund

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why does it take so long?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``You have to realize, Mr. Gennaro,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said, <div class="bookquote">``t
hat there's a lot of extraneous movement out
there. Branches blowing in the wind, birds flying a

ah. Okay. Count's finished.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said, <div class="bookquote">``You don't see the kids?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Arnold twisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) chair, and looked back to the
map. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``at the moment, there
are no additionals on the map at all. Everything ou

They're probably up in a tree, or somewhere else wh
ere we can't see them. I wouldn't worry yet.
Several animals haven't shown up, like the big rex.
That's probably because it's sleeping
somewhere and not moving. The people may be sleepin
g, too. We just don't know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Muldoon shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``We better get on with it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We need to repair the fences,

 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold turned to Gennaro. <div class="bookquote">``You may want to see how
Dr. Malcolm is doing. Tell Dr. Harding
that Muldoon will need him (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) in about an hour to supe
rvise the herding. And I'll notify Mr. Hammond
that we're starting our final cleanup.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro passed through the iron gates and went in t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) front door of the Safari Lodge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) saw
Ellie Sattler coming down the hallway, carrying tow
els and a pan of steaming water. <div class="bookquote">``There's a
kitchen at the other end,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We're using t

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How is he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surprisingly good,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) said.
Gennarro followed Ellie down to Malcolm's room, and
was startled to hear the sound of
laughter. The mathematician lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>mathematician</b></font>) back in the
bed, with Harding adjusting an IV line.
<div class="bookquote">``So the other man says, `I'll tell you frankly, I d
idn't like it, Bill. I went back to toilet paper!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div><p/>Harding was laughing.
<div class="bookquote">``It's not bad, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Ah.
Mr. Gennaro. You've come to see me. Now you
know what happens from trying to get a leg up on th
e situation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro came in, tentatively.
Harding said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)'s on fairly high doses of morphin
e.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not high enough, I can tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said. <div class="bookquote">``C
hrist, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)'s stingy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) drugs. Did they find
the others yet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, not yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``But I'm glad to see y
ou doing so well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How else should I be doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said, <div class="bookquote">``with a
compound fracture of the leg that is likely
septic and beginning to smell rather, ah, pungent?
But I always say, if you can't keep a sense of
humor ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Gennaro smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Do you remember what happened?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course I remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think
you could be bitten by a Tyrannosaurus
rex and it would escape your mind? No indeed, I'll
tell you, you'd remember it for the rest of your
life. In my case, perhaps not a terribly long time.
But, still-yes, I remember.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm described running from the Land Cruiser in
the rain, and being chased down by the
rex. <div class="bookquote">``It was my own damned fault, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was too close,
but I was panicked. In any case, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) picked
me up in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) jaws.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``Torso,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said, and lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) shirt. A broa
d semicircle of bruised punctures ran from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
shoulder to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) navel. ``Lifted me up in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) jaws, s
hook me bloody hard, and threw me down. And I
was fine-terrified of course, but, still and all, f
ine-right up to the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) threw me. I broke the

<p/>leg in the fall. But the bite was not half bad.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
sighed. ``Considering.''
Harding said, ``Most of the big carnivores don't hav
e strong jaws. The real power is in the neck
musculature. The jaws just hold on, while they use
the neck to twist and rip. But with a small
creature like Dr. Malcolm, the animal would just sh
ake him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>), and then toss him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>).''
``I'm afraid that's right,'' Malcolm said. ``I doubt I
'd have survived, except the big chap's heart
wasn't in it. To tell the truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) struck me as a
rather clumsy attacker of anything less than an
automobile or a small apartment building.''
``You think he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) attacked halfheartedly?''
``It pains me to say it,'' Malcolm said, ``but I don't
honestly feel I had his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) full attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) had
mine, of course. But, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) weighs eight tons. I
don't. ''
Gennaro turned to Harding and said, ``They're going
to repair the fences now. Arnold says
Muldoon will need your help herding animals.''
``Okay,'' Harding said.
``So long as you leave me Dr. Sattler, and ample mor
phine,'' Malcolm said. ``And so long as we
do not have a Malcolm Effect here.''
``What's a Malcolm Effect?'' Gennaro said.
``Modesty forbids me,'' Malcolm said, ``from telling y
ou the details of a phenomenon named after
me.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) sighed again, and closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) eyes. In a mom
ent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) was sleeping.
Ellie walked out into the hallway with Gennaro. ``Do
n't be fooled,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said. ``It's a great strain
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>). When will you have a helicopter here?''
``A helicopter?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) needs surgery on that leg. Make sure they send
for a helicopter, and get him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) off this
island.''
The Park
The portable generator sputtered and roared to life
, and the quartz floodlights glowed at the ends
of their telescoping arms. Muldoon heard the soft g
urgle of the jungle river a few Yards to the
north. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) turned back to the maintenance van and sa
w one of the workmen coming out with a big
power saw.
``No, no,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said. ``Just the ropes, Carlos. We don'
t need to cut it.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) turned back to look at the fence. They had diffi
culty finding the shorted section at first,
because there wasn't much to see: a small protocarp
us tree was leaning against the fence. It was
one of several that had been planted in this region
of the park, their featherv branches intended to
conceal the fence from view.
But this particular tree had been tied down with gu
y wires and turnbuckles. The wires had
broken free in the storm, and the metal turnbuckles
had blown against the fence and shorted it
out. Of course, none of this should have happened;
grounds crews were supposed to use plastic-
coated wires and ceramic turnbuckles near fences. B
ut it had happened anyway.
In any case, it wasn't going to be a big job. All t
hey had to do was pull the tree off the fence,
remove the metal fittings, and mark it for the gard
eners to fix in the morning. It shouldn't take
more than twenty minutes. And that was just as well
, because Muldoon knew the dilophosaurs
always stayed close to the river. Even though the w
orkmen were separated from the river by the
fence, the dilos could spit right through it, deliv
ering their blinding poison.
Ramn, one of the workmen, came over. ``Seor Muldoo
n,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said, ``did you see the lights?''
``What lights?'' Muldoon said.
Ramn pointed to the east, through the jungle. ``I s
aw it as we were coming out. It is there, very
faint. You see it? It looks like the lights of a ca
r, but it is not moving.''
Muldoon squinted. It probably was just a maintenanc
e light. After all, power was back on.
``We'll worry about it later,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said. ``Right now l
et's just get that tree off the fence.''
Arnold was in an expansive mood. The park was almos
t back in order. Muldoon was repairing the
fences. Hammond had gone off to supervise the trans
fer of the animals with Harding. Although
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was tired, Arnold was feeling good; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) was even
in a mood to indulge the lawyer, Gennaro.
``The Malcolm Effect?'' Arnold said. ``You worried abo

``I'm just curious,'' Gennaro said.
``You mean you want me to tell you why Ian Malcolm i
s wrong?''
``Sure.''
Arnold lit another cigarette. ``It's technical.''
``Try me.''
``Okay,'' Arnold said. ``Chaos theory describes nonlin
ear systems. It's now become a very broad
theory that's been used to study everything from th
e stock market, to rioting crowds, to brain
waves during epilepsy. A very fashionable theory. V
ery trendy to apply it to any complex system
where there might be unpredictability. Okay?''
``Okay,'' Gennaro said.
``Ian Malcolm is a mathematician specializing in cha
os theory. Quite amusing and personable,
but basically what he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) does, besides wear black, is
use computers to model the behavior of
complex systems. And John Hammond loves the latest
scientific fad, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) asked Malcolm to
model the system at Jurassic Park. Which Malcolm di
d. Malcolm's models are all phase-space
shapes on a computer screen. Have you seen them?''
``No,'' Gennaro said.
``Well, they look like a weird twisted ship's propel
ler. According to Malcolm, the behavior of any
system follows the surface of the propeller. You wi
th me?''
``Not exactly,'' Gennaro said.
Arnold held his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) hand in the air. <div class="bookquote">``Let's say I put a
drop of water on the back of my hand. That
drop is going to run off my hand. Maybe it'll run t

<div class="bookquote">``Chaos theory treats the behavior of a whole system

about Jurassic Park. That it had inherent

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Inherent instability,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``And what did

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We disagreed with it, and ignored it, of course,''

<div class="bookquote">``Was that wise?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>In the harsh quartz lights, the hypsilophodont's gr
een head hung down out of the sling, the
tongue dangling, the eyes dull.
<div class="bookquote">``Careful! Careful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond shouted, as the crane b
egan to lift.
Harding grunted and eased the head back onto the le
ather straps. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) didn't want to impede
circulation through the carotid artery. The crane h
issed as it lifted the animal into the air, onto th
e
waiting flatbed truck. The hypsy was a small dryosa
ur, seven feet long, weighing about five
hundred pounds. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was dark green with mottled bro
wn spots. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was breathing slowly, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) seemed all right. Harding had shot her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) a few mo
ments before with the tranquilizer gun, and
apparently he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had guessed the correct dose. There w
as always a tense moment dosing these big
animals. Too little and they would run off into the
forest, collapsing where you couldn't get to
them. Too much and they went into terminal cardiac
arrest. This one had taken a single bounding
leap and keeled over. Perfectly dosed.
<div class="bookquote">``Watch it! Easy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond was shouting to the workm
en.
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hammond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Harding said. <div class="bookquote">``Please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, they should be careful-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They are being careful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Harding said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) climbed
up onto the back of the flatbed as the hypsy
came down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) set her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) into the restraining harn
ess. Harding slipped on the cardiogram collar
that monitored heartbeat, then picked up the big el
ectronic thermometer the size of a turkey
baster and slipped it into the rectum. It beeped: 9
6.2 degrees.
<div class="bookquote">``How is she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond asked fretfully.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Harding said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s only dropped a d
egree and a half.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said. <div class="bookquote">``Too deep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) waking up and jumping off the t
ruck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Harding snapped.
Before coming to the park, Harding had been the chi
ef of veterinary medicine at the San Diego
Zoo, and the world's leading expert on avian care.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) flew all over the world, consulting with zoos
in Europe, India, and Japan on the care of exotic b
irds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)'d had no interest when this peculiar
little man showed up, offering him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a position in a
private game park. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learned what
Hammond had done ... It was impossible to pass up.
Harding had an academic bent, and the
prospect of writing the first Textbook of Veterinar
y Internal Medicine: Diseases of Dinosauria was
compelling. In the late twentieth century, veterina
ry medicine was scientifically advanced- the
best zoos ran clinics little different from hospita
ls. New textbooks were merely refinements of old.
For a world-class practitioner, there were no world
s left to conquer. But to be the first to care for
a
whole new class of animals: that was something!
And Harding had never regretted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) decision, He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) ha
d developed considerable expertise with
these animals. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) didn't want to hear from Hamm
ond now.
The hypsy snorted and twitched. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was still breat
hing shallowly; there was no ocular reflex
yet. But it was time to get moving. <div class="bookquote">``All aboard,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>H
arding shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Let's get this girl back to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
paddock.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Living systems,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said, <div class="bookquote">``are not like mechan
ical systems. Living systems are never in
equilibrium. They are inherently unstable. They may
seem stable, but they're not. Everything is
moving and changing. In a sense, everything is on t
he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) edge of collapse.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Gennaro was frowning. <div class="bookquote">``But lots of things don't cha
nge; body temperature doesn't change, all
kinds of other-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Body temperature changes constantly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said.
<div class="bookquote">``Constantly. It changes cyclically over
twenty-four hours, lowest in the morning, highest i
n the afternoon. It changes with mood, with
disease, with exercise, with outside temperature, w
ith food. It continuously fluctuates up and
down. Tiny jiggles on a graph. Because, at any mome
nt, some forces are pushing temperature
up, and other forces are pulling it down. It is inh
erently unstable. And every other aspect of living
systems is like that, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So you're saying ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Malcolm's just another theoretician,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said.
<div class="bookquote">``Sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) office, he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) made a nice
mathematical model, and it never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) th
at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) saw as defects were actually
necessities. Look: when I was working on missiles,
we dealt with something called `resonant
yaw.' Resonant yaw meant that, even though a missil
e was only slightly unstable off the pad, it
was hopeless. It was inevitably going to go out of
control, and it couldn't be brought back. That's a
feature of mechanical systems. A little wobble can
get worse until the whole system collapses. But
those same little wobbles are essential to a living
system. They mean the system is healthy
and responsive. Malcolm never understood that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) didn't understand that? He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) seems p
retty clear on the difference between
living and nonliving-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``The proof is right here.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)
pointed to the screens.
<div class="bookquote">``In less than an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the park will all
be back on line. The only thing I've got left to
clear is the telephones. For some reason, they're s
till out. But everything else will be working.
And that's not theoretical. That's a fact.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The needle went deep into the neck, and Harding inj
ected the medrine into the anesthetized
female dryosaur as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) side on the groun
d. Immediately the animal began to recover,
snorting and kicking her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) powerful hind legs.
<div class="bookquote">``Back, everybody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Harding said, scrambling away. <div class="bookquote">''
Get back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>The dinosaur staggered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) feet, standing drunke
nly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) lizard head, stared at
the people standing back in the quartz lights, and
blinked.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>)'s drooling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said, worried.
<div class="bookquote">``Temporary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Harding said. <div class="bookquote">``It'll stop.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The dryosaur coughed, and then moved slowly across
the field, away from the lights.
<div class="bookquote">``Why isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) hopping?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Harding said. <div class="bookquote">``It'll take her (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) about an

back to the car. <div class="bookquote">``Okay, boys, let's go deal with th
e stego.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon watched as the last of the stakes was pound
ed into the ground. The lines were pulled
taut, and the protocarpus tree was lifted clear. Mu
ldoon could see the blackened, charred streaks
on the silver fence where the short had occurred. A
t the base of the fence, several ceramic
insulators had burst. They would have to be replace
d. But before that could be done, Arnold
would to have to shut down all the fences.
<div class="bookquote">``Control. This is Muldoon. We're ready to begin rep
air.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All

 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) watch. Somewhere in the dist
ance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) heard soft hooting. It sounded
like owls, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) knew it was the dilophosaurs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>)
went over to Ramn and said, <div class="bookquote">``Let's finish this
up. I want to get to those other sections of fence.
''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>An hour went by. Donald Gennaro stared at the glowi

numbers flickered and changed. <div class="bookquote">``What's happening no

 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold worked at the console. <div class="bookquote">``I'm trying to get th

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I mean out there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold glanced up at the board. <div class="bookquote">``It looks as if the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just a minute.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>On one of the monitors, Gennaro saw a high angle do

panned. <div class="bookquote">``We're turning the camera now to get a look

 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro saw a shining wall of metallic mesh in the
light. One section had been trampled,
knocked flat. Muldoon's Jeep and work crew were the
re.
<div class="bookquote">``Huh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``Looks like the rex went into t

 (<font color='red'><b>Dawn</b></font>)</div>Dawn
Grant was awakened by a loud grinding sound, follow
ed by a mechanical clanking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) opened
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) eyes and saw a bale of bay rolling past him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) on
a conveyor belt, up toward the ceiling. Two
more bales followed it. Then the clanking stopped a
s abruptly as it had begun, and the concrete
building was silent again.
Grant yawned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) stretched sleepily, winced in pain
, and sat up.
Soft yellow light came through the side windows. It
was morning: he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had slept the whole night!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) looked quickly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) watch: 5:00 a.m. Still alm
ost six hours to go before the boat had to be
recalled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) rolled onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) back, groaning. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
ad throbbed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) body ached as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had
been beaten up. From around the corner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heard a
squeaking sound, like a rusty wheel. And
then Lex giggling.
Grant stood slowly, and looked at the building. Now
that it was daylight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could see it was
some kind of a maintenance building, with stacks of
hay and supplies. On the wall he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw a gray
metal box and a stenciled sign: SAUROPOD MAINTENANC
E BLDG -LRB-04-RRB-. This must be the
sauropod paddock, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) opened the
box and saw a telephone, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
lifted the receiver he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heard only hissing static. A
pparently the phones weren't working yet.
<div class="bookquote">``Chew your food,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex was saying. <div class="bookquote">``Don't be a piggy
, Ralph.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant walked around the corner and found Lex by the
bars, holding out handfuls of bay to an
animal outside that looked like a large pink pig an
d was making the squeaking sounds Grant had
heard. It was actually an infant triceratops, about
the size of a pony. The infant didn't have horns
on its head yet, just a curved bony frill behind bi
g soft eyes. It poked its snout through the bars
toward Lex, its eyes watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) fed it mor
e hay.
<div class="bookquote">``That's better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``There's plenty of hay,
don't worry.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) patted the baby on the head.
<div class="bookquote">``You like hay, don't you, Ralph?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex turned back and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``This is Ralph,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>)'s my friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) like
s hay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant took a step and stopped, wincing. <div class="bookquote">``You look p
retty
bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``I feel pretty bad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tim, too. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) nose is all swollen up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where is Tim?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Peeing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You want to help me feed Ralph
?''
 (<font color='red'><b>baby</b></font>)</div>The baby triceratops looked at Grant. Hay stuck out
of both sides of its mouth, dropping on the
floor as it chewed.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>)'s a very messy eater,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>)'s very
hungry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>The baby finished chewing and licked its lips. It o
pened its mouth, waiting for more. Grant
could see the slender sharp teeth, and the beaky up
per jaw, like a parrot.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay, just a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, scooping up more s
traw from the concrete floor, <div class="bookquote">``Honestly,
Ralph,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You'd think your mother never fe
d you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why is his (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) name Ralph?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) looks like Ralph. At school.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant came closer and touched the skin of the neck
gently.
<div class="bookquote">``It's okay, you can pet him (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) likes i
t when you pet him (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>), don't you, Ralph?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The skin felt dry and warm, with the pebbled textur
e of a football. Ralph gave a little squeak as
Grant petted it. Outside the bars, its thick tail s
wung back and forth with pleasure.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>)'s pretty tame.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ralph</b></font>)</div>Ralph looked from Lex to Grant
as it ate, and showed no sign of fear. It
reminded Grant that the dinosaurs didn't have ordin
ary responses to people. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe I can ride
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``Let's not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I bet he (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>)'d let me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``It'd be fun to ride
a dinosaur.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant looked out the bars past the animal, to the o
pen fields of the sauropod compound. It was
growing lighter every minute. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) should go outside,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) thought, and set off one of the motion
sensors on the field above. After all, it might tak
e the people in the control room an hour to get
out here to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) didn't like the idea that t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) phones were still down... .
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) heard a deep snorting sound, like the snort of a
very large horse, and suddenly the baby
became agitated. It tried to pull its head back thr
ough the bars, but got caught on the edge of its
frill, and it squeaked in fright.
Tle snorting came again. It was closer this time.
Ralph reared up on its hind legs, frantic to get ou
t from between the bars, It wriggled its head
back and forth, rubbing against the bars.
<div class="bookquote">``Ralph, take it easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``Push him (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) reached up to Ralph'
s head and leaned against it, pushing the
animal sideways and backward. The frill popped free
and the baby fell outside the bars, losing its
balance and flopping on its side. Then the baby was
covered in shadow, and a huge leg came
into view, thicker than a tree trunk. The foot had
five curved toenails, like an elephant's.
Ralph looked up and squeaked. A head came down into
view: six feet long, with three long
white horns, one above each of the large brown eyes
and a smaller horn at the tip of the nose. It
was a full-grown triceratops. The big animal peered
at Lex and Grant, blinking slowly, and then
turned its attention to Ralph. A tongue came out an
d licked the baby. Ralph squeaked and
rubbed up against the big leg happily.
<div class="bookquote">``Is that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>) mom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``Looks like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
<div class="bookquote">``Should we feed the mom, too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
But the big triceratops was already nudging Ralph w
ith her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) snout, pushing the baby away from
the bars.
<div class="bookquote">``Guess not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The infant</b></font>)</div>The infant turned away from the bars and walked off
. From time to time, the big mother nudged
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) baby, guiding it away, as they both walked out
into the fields.
<div class="bookquote">``Goodbye, Ralph,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, waving. Tim came out of
the shadows of the building.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going up on the h
ill to set off the motion sensors, so they'll
know to come get us. You two stay here and wait for
me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``Why? Stay here. It's safe here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're not leaving us,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Right, Timmy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
They crawled through the bars, stepping outside.
It was just before dawn.
The air was warm and humid, the sky soft pink and p
urple. A white mist clung low to the
ground. Some distance away, they saw the mother tri
ceratops and the baby moving away toward
a herd of large duckbilled hadrosaurs, eating folia
ge from trees at the edge of the lagoon.
Some of the hadrosaurs stood knee-deep in the water
. They drank, lowering their flat heads,
meeting their own reflections in the still water. T
hen they looked up again, their heads swiveling.
At the water's edge, one of the babies ventured out
, squeaked, and scrambled back while the
adults watched indulgently.
Farther South, other hadrosaurs were eating the low
er vegetation. Sometimes they reared up
on their hind legs, resting their forelegs on the t
ree trunks, so they could reach the leaves on
higher branches. And in the far distance, a giant a
patosaur stood above the trees, the tiny head
swiveling on the long neck. The scene was so peacef
ul Grant found it bard to imagine any
danger.
<div class="bookquote">``Yew!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex shouted, ducking. Two giant red dragonfl
ies with six-foot wingspans bummed past
them. <div class="bookquote">``What was that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dragonflies,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The Jurassic was a time of
huge insects.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do
they bite?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
Tim held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) band. One of the dragonflies light
ed on it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could feel the weight of the huge
insect.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Timmy</b></font>)'s going to bite you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex warned.
But the dragonfly just slowly flapped its red-veine
d transparent wings, and then, when Tim
moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) arm, flew off again,
<div class="bookquote">``Which way do we go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``There.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They started walking across the field. They reached
a black box mounted on a heavy metal
tripod, the first of the motion sensors. Grant stop
ped and waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) band in front of it back and
forth, but nothing happened. If the phones didn't w
ork, perhaps the sensors didn't work, either.
<div class="bookquote">``We'll try another one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said, pointing across t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) field. Somewhere in the distance, they heard
the roar of a large animal.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah hell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``I just can't find it.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)
sipped coffee and stared bleary-eyed at the screens
.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) had taken all the video monitors off line. In th
e control room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) was searching the computer
code. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) was exhausted; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)'d been working for twelv
e straight hours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) turned to Wu, who had
come up from the lab.
<div class="bookquote">``Find what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The phones are still out. I can't get them back on
. I think Nedry did something to the phones.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu lifted one phone, heard hissing. <div class="bookquote">``Sounds like a
modem.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it's not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``Because I went down i
nto the basement and shut off all the
modems. What you're hearing is just white noise tha
t sounds like a modem transmitting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So the phone lines are jammed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Basically, yes. Nedry jammed them very well. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s
inserted some kind of a lockout into the
program code, and now I can't find it, because I ga
ve that restore command which erased part of
the program listings. But apparently the command to
shut off the phones is still resident in the
computer memory.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu shrugged. ``So? Just reset: shut the system down
and you'll clear memory.
``I've never done it before,'' Arnold said. ``And I'm
reluctant to do it. Maybe all the systems will
come back on start-up-but maybe they won't. I'm not
a computer expert, and neither are you. Not
really. And without an open phone line, we can't ta
lk to anybody who is.''
``If the command is RAM-resident, it won't show up i
n the code. You can do a RAM dump and
search that, but you don't know what you're searchi
ng for. I think all you can do is reset.''
Gennaro stormed in. ``We still don't have any teleph
ones.''
``Working on it.''
``You've been working on it since midnight. And Malc
olm is worse. He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) needs medical
attention.''
``It means I'll have to shut down,'' Arnold said. ``I
can't be sure everything will come back on.''
Gennaro said, ``Look. There's a sick man over in tha
t lodge. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needs a doctor or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll die. You
can't call for a doctor unless you have a phone. Fo
ur people have probably died already. Now,
shut down and get the phones working!''
Arnold hesitated.
``Well?'' Gennaro said.
``Well, it's just ... the safety systems don't all
ow the computer to be shut down, and-''
``Then turn the goddamn safety systems off! Can't yo
u get it through your head that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s going
to die unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets help?''
``Okay,'' Arnold said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) got up and went to the main panel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) opened the
doors, and uncovered the metal swing-
latches over the safety switches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) popped them of
f, one after another. ``You asked for it,''
Arnold said. ``And you got it.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) threw the master switch.
The control room was dark. All the monitors were bl
ack, The three men stood there in the dark.
``How long do we have to wait?'' Gennaro said. ``Thirt
y seconds,'' Arnold said.
``P-U!'' Lex said, as they crossed the field.
``What?'' Grant said.
``That smell!'' Lex said. ``It stinks like rotten garb
age.''
Grant hesitated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) stared across the field toward
the distant trees, looking for movement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
saw nothing. There was hardly a breeze to stir the
branches. It was peaceful and silent in the
early morning. ``I think it's your imagination,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
said.
``Is not-''
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heard the honking sound. It came from the h
erd of duckbilled hadrosaurs behind
them. First one animal, then another and another, u
ntil the whole herd had taken up the honking
cry. The duckbills were agitated, twisting and turn
ing, hurrying out of the water, circling the young
ones to protect them... .
They smell it, too, Grant thought.
With a roar, the tyrannosaur burst from the trees f
ifty yards away, near the lagoon. It rushed
out across the open field with huge strides. It ign
ored them, heading toward the herd of
hadrosaurs.
``I told you!'' Lex screamed. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody listens to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In the distance, the duckbills were honking and sta
rting to run. Grant could feel the earth shake
beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``Come on, kids!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) grabbed Lex,
lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>) bodily off the ground, and ran with
Tim through the grass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) had glimpses of the tyran
nosaur down by the lagoon, lunging at the
hadrosaurs, which swung their big tails in defense
and bonked loudly and continuously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) heard
the crashing of foliage and trees, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) look
ed over again, the duckbills were charging.
In the darkened control room, Arnold checked his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) wa
tch. Thirty seconds. The memory should be
cleared by now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) pushed the main power switch bac
k on.
Nothing happened.
Arnold's stomach heaved. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) pushed the switch off,
then on again. Still nothing happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)
felt sweat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) brow.
<div class="bookquote">``What's wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh hell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) remembered you had
to turn the safety swiitches back on
before you restarted the power. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) flipped on the t
hree safeties, and covered them again with the
latch covers. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) breath, and turned t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) main power switch.
The room lights came on. The

<p/>computer beeped. The screens

<p/>hummed.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) hurried to the main mo
nitor. There were rows of labels on the
screen:



<p/>Gennaro reached for the phone, but it was dead. No
static hissing this time-just nothing at all.
<div class="bookquote">``What's this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Give me a second,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``After a reset, al
l the system modules have to be brought on
line manually.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Quickly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) went back to work.
<div class="bookquote">``Why manually?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``Will you just let me work, for Christ's sake?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said, <div class="bookquote">``The system is not intended to ever shut d
own. So, if it does shut down, it assumes
that there is a problem somewhere. It requires you
to start up everything manually, Otherwise, if
there were a short somewhere, the system would star
t up, short out, start up again, short out
again, in an endless cycle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Okay,'' Arnold said. ``We're going.''
Gennaro picked up the phone and started to dial, wh
en he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) suddenly stopped.
``Jesus, look at that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) pointed to one o
f the video monitors.
But Arnold wasn't listening, He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) was staring at the
map, where a tight cluster of dots by the
lagoon had started to move in a coordinated way. Mo
ving fast, in a kind of swirl.
``What's happening?'' Gennaro said.
``The duckbills,'' Arnold said tonelessly. ``They've s
tampeded.''
The duckbills charged with surprising speed, their
enormous bodies in a tight cluster, honking
and roaring, the infants squealing and trying to st
ay out from underfoot. The herd raised a great
cloud of yellow dust. Grant couldn't see the tyrann
osaur.
The duckbills were running right toward them.
Still carrying Lex, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) ran with Tim toward a rocky
outcrop, with a stand of big conifers. They ran
hard, feeling the ground shake beneath their feet.
The sound of the approaching herd was
deafening, like the sound of jets at an airport. It
filled the air, and hurt their ears. Lex was shout
ing
something, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) couldn't hear what she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was saying
, and as they scrambled onto the rocks, the
herd closed in around them.
Grant saw the immense legs of the first hadrosaurs
that charged past, each animal weighing
five tons, and then they were enveloped in a cloud
so dense he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could see nothing at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had
the impression of huge bodies, giant limbs, bellowi
ng cries of pain as the animals wheeled and
circled. One duckbill struck a boulder and it rolle
d past them, out into the field beyond.
In the dense cloud of dust, they could see almost n
othing beyond the rocks. They clung to the
boulders, listening to the screams and honks, the m
enacing roar of the tyrannosaur. Lex dug her (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
fingers into Grant's shoulder.
Another hadrosaur slammed its big tail against the
rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood. Grant
waited until the sounds of the fighting had moved o
ff to the left, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) pushed the kids to
start climbing the largest tree. They climbed swift
ly, feeling for the branches, as the animals
stampeded all around them in the dust. They went up
twenty feet, and then Lex clutched at Grant
and refused to go farther. Tim was tired, too, and
Grant thought they were high enough. Through
the dust, they could see the broad backs of the ani
mals below as they wheeled and bonked.
Grant propped himself against the coarse bark of th
e trunk, coughed in the dust, closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) eyes,
and waited.
Arnold adjusted the camera as the herd moved away.
The dust slowly cleared. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) saw that the
hadrosaurs had scattered, and the tyrannosaur had s
topped running, which could only mean it
had made a kill. The tyrannosaur was now near the l
agoon. Arnold looked at the video monitor
and said, ``Better get Muldoon to go out there and s
ee how bad it is.''
``I'll get him (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>),'' Gennaro said, and left the room.
The Park
A faint crackling sound, like a fire in a fireplace
. Something warm and wet tickled Grant's ankle.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) eyes and saw an enormous beige head.
The head tapered to a flat mouth shaped
like the bill of a duck. The eyes, protruding above
the flat duckbill, were gentle and soft like a
cow's. The duck mouth opened and chewed branches on
the limb where Grant was sitting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
saw large flat teeth in the check. The warm lips to
uched his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) ankle again as the animal chewed.
A duckbilled hadrosaur. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was astonished to see it
up close. Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was afraid; all the
species of duckbilled dinosaurs were herbivorous, a
nd this one acted exactly like a cow. Even
though it was huge, its manner was so calm and peac
eful Grant didn't feel threatened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) stayed
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was on the branch, careful not to move, an
d watched as it ate.
The reason Grant was astonished was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had a p
roprietary feeling about this animal: it
was probably a maiasaur, from the late Cretaceous i
n Montana. With John Horner, Grant had
been the first to describe the species. Maiasaurs h
ad an upcurved lip, which gave them the
appearance of smiling. The name meant ``good mother
lizard''; maiasaurs were thought to protect
their eggs until the babies were born and could tak
e care of themselves.
Grant heard an insistent chirping, and the big head
swung down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) moved just enough to see
the baby hadrosaur scampering around the feet of th
e adult. The baby was dark beige with black
spots. The adult bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head low to the ground an
d waited, unmoving, while the baby stood up
on its hind legs, resting its front legs on the mot
her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)'s jaw, and ate the branches that protruded
from the side of the mother's mouth.
The mother waited patiently until the baby had fini
shed eating, and dropped back down to all
fours again. Then the big head came back up toward
Grant.
The hadrosaur continued to eat just a few feet from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). Grant looked at the two elongated
airholes on top of the flat upper bill. Apparently
the dinosaur couldn't smell Grant. And even
though the left eye was looking right at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), for s
ome reason the hadrosaur didn't react to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) remembered how the tyrannosaur had failed to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), the previous night. Grant decided
on an experiment.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) coughed.
Instantly the hadrosaur froze, the big head suddenl
y still, the jaws no longer chewing. Only the
eye moved, looking for the source of the sound. The
n, after a moment, when there seemed to be
no danger, the animal resumed chewing.
Amazing, Grant thought.
Sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) arms, Lex opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) eyes and said,
``Hey, what's that?''
The hadrosaur trumpeted in alarm, a loud resonant b
onk that so startled Lex that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) nearly
fell out of the tree. The hadrosaur pulled its head
away from the branch and trumpeted again.
``Don't make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mad,'' Tim said, from the branch abo
ve.
The baby chirped and scurried beneath the mother's
legs as the hadrosaur stepped away from
the tree. The mother cocked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head and peered inq
uisitively at the branch where Grant and
Lex were sitting. With its upturned smiling lips, t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) dinosaur had a comical appearance.
``Is it dumb?'' Lex said.
``No,'' Grant said. ``You just surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''
``Well,'' Lex said, ``is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) going to let us get down,
or what?''
The hadrosaur had backed ten feet away from the tre
e. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bonked again. Grant had the
impression she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was trying to frighten them away. Bu
t the dinosaur didn't really seem to know
what to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) acted confused and uneasy. They wai
ted in silence, and after a minute the
hadrosaur approached the branch again, jaws moving
in anticipation. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was clearly going to
resume eating.
``Forget it,'' Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not staying here.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
started to climb down the branches. At her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
movement, the hadrosaur trumpeted in fresh alarm.
Grant was amazed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) thought, It really can't see u
s when we don't move. And after a minute
it literally forgets that we're here. This was just
like the tyrannosaur-another classic example of an

<p/>amphibian visual cortex. Studies of frogs had shown
that amphibians only saw moving things, like
insects. If something didn't move, they literally d
idn't see it. The same thing seemed to be true of
dinosaurs.
In any case, the maiasaur now seemed to find these
strange creatures climbing down the tree
too upsetting. With a final honk, she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) nudged her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) ba
by, and lumbered slowly away. She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) paused
once, and looked back at them, then continued on.
They reached the ground. Lex shook herself off. Bot
h children were covered in a layer of fine
dust. All around them, the grass had been flattened
. There were streaks of blood, and a sour
smell.
Grant looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``We better get going, ki
ds,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Not me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not walking out there any

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We have to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said, <div class="bookquote">``we have to tell them about
the boat. Since they can't seem to see us
on the motion sensors, we have to go all the way ba
ck ourselves. It's the only way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why can't we take the raft?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
<div class="bookquote">``What raft?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim pointed to the low concrete maintenance buildin
g with the bars, where they had spent the
night. It was twenty yards away, across the field.
<div class="bookquote">``I saw a raft back there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said.
Grant immediately understood the advantages. It was
now seven o'clock in the morning. They
had at least eight miles to go. If they could take
a raft along the river, they would make much
faster progress than going overland. <div class="bookquote">``Let's do it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
Arnold punched the visual search mode and watched a
s the monitors began to scan throughout
the park, the images changing every two seconds. It
was tiring to watch, but it was the fastest
way to find Nedry's Jeep, and Muldoon had been adam
ant about that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) had gone out with
Gennaro to look at the stampede, but now that it wa
s daylight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) wanted the car found. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>)
wanted the weapons.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) intercom clicked. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Arnold, may I have a wor
d with you, please?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>It
was Hammond. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) sounded like the voice of God.
<div class="bookquote">``You want to come here, Mr. Hammond?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Arnold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said. <div class="bookquote">``Come to me. I'm in
the genetics lab with Dr. Wu. We'll be
waiting for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold sighed, and stepped away from the screens.
Grant stumbled deep in the gloomy recesses of the b
uilding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) pushed past five-gallon
containers of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, sp
are tires for a Jeep, coils of cyclone fencing,
hundred-pound fertilizer bags, stacks of brown cera
mic insulators, empty motor-oil cans, work
lights and cables.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't see any raft.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Keep going.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe, green mesb
... and two plastic oars hung on clips on
the concrete wall.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but where's the raft?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>``It

<p/>must be here somewhere,'' Tim said.
``You never saw a raft?''
``No, I just assumed it was here.''
Poking among the junk, Grant found no raft. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
did find a set of plans, rolled up and
speckled with mold from humidity, stuck back in a m
etal cabinet on the wall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) spread the plans
on the floor, brushing away a big spider. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) looked
at them for a long time.
``I'm hungry...'' <div class="bookquote">``Just a

<p/>minute.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>They were detailed topographical charts for the mai
n area of the island, where they now were.
According to this, the lagoon narrowed into the riv
er they had seen earlier, which twisted
northward ... right through the aviary ... and
on to within a half-mile of the visitor lodge.
He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) flipped back through the pages. How to get to th
e lagoon? According to the plans, there
should be a door at the back of the building they w
ere in. Grant looked up, and saw it, recessed
back in the concrete wall. The door was wide enough
for a car. Opening it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw a paved road
running straight down toward the lagoon. The road w
as dug below ground level, so it couldn't be
seen from above. It must be another service road. A
nd it led to a dock at the edge of the lagoon.
And clearly stenciled on the dock was RAFT STORAGE.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said, <div class="bookquote">``look at this.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) held out a meta
l case to Grant.
Opening it, Grant found a compressed-air pistol and
a cloth belt that held darts. There were six
darts in all, each as thick as his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) finger. Labeled
MORO-709.
<div class="bookquote">``Good Work, Tim.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) slung the belt around his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) shou
lder, and stuck the gun in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) trousers.
<div class="bookquote">``Is it a tranquilizer gun?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'd say so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What about the boat?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``I think it's on the dock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. They starte
d down the road. Grant carried the oars on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``I hope it's a big raft,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, <div class="bookquote">``beca
use I can't swim.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't worry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Maybe we can catch some fish,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said.
They walked down the road with the sloping embankme
nt rising up on both sides of them.
They heard a deep rhythmic snorting sound, but Gran
t could not see where it was coming from.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you sure there's a raft down here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said,
wrinkling her (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>) nose.
<div class="bookquote">``Probably,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
The rhythmic snorting became louder as they walked,
but they also heard a steady droning,
buzzing sound. When they reached the end of the roa
d, at the edge of the small concrete dock,
Grant froze in shock.
The tyrannosaur was right there.
It was sitting upright in the shade of a tree, its
hind legs stretched out in front. Its eyes were
open but it was not moving, except for its head, wh
ich lifted and fell gently with each snorting
sound. The buzzing came from the clouds of flies th
at surrounded it, crawling over its face and
slack jaws, its bloody fangs, and the red haunch of
a killed hadrosaur that lay on its side behind
the tyrannosaur.
The tyrannosaur was only twenty yards away. Grant f
elt sure it must have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), but the
big animal did not respond. It just sat there. It t
ook him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) a moment to realize: the tyrannosaur was
asleep. Sitting up, but asleep.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) signaled to Tim and Lex to stay where they were.
Grant walked slowly forward onto the
dock, in full view of the tyrannosaur. The big anim
al continued to sleep, snoring softly.
Near the end of the dock, a wooden shed was painted
green to blend with the foliage. Grant
quietly unlatched the door and looked inside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sa
w a half-dozen orange life vests hanging on
the wall, several rolls of wire-mesh fencing, some
coils of rope, and twob ig rubber cubes sitting
on the floor. The cubes were strapped tight with fl
at rubber belts.
Rafts.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) looked back at Lex. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)

<p/>mouthed: No boat He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) nodded,

<p/>Yes.
The tyrannosaur raised its forelimb to swipe at the
flies buzzing around its snout. But otherwise
it did not move. Grant pulled one of the cubes out
onto the dock. It was surprisingly heavy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
freed the straps, found the inflation cylinder. Wit
h a loud hiss, the rubber began to expand, and
then with a hiss-whap! it popped fully open on the
dock. The sound was fearfully loud in their
ears.
Grant turned, stared up at the dinosaur.
The tyrannosaur grunted, and snorted. It began to m
ove. Grant braced himself to run, but the
animal shifted its ponderous bulk and then it settl
ed back against the tree trunk and gave a long,
growling belch.
Lex looked disgusted, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) hand in front of h
er face.
Grant was soaked in sweat from the tension. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) drag
ged the rubber raft across the dock. It
flopped into the water with a loud splash.
The dinosaur continued to sleep.
Grant tied the boat up to the dock, and returned to
the shed to take out two life preservers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
put these in the boat, and then waved for the kids
to come out onto the dock.
Pale with fear, Lex waved back, No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)

<p/>gestured: Yes.
The tyrannosaur continued to sleep.
Grant stabbed in the air with an emphatic finger. L
ex came silently, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) gestured for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) to
get into the raft; then Tim got in, and they both p
ut on their life vests. Grant got in and pushed off
.
The raft drifted silently out into the lagoon. Gran
t picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) paddles and fitted them into the
oarlocks. They moved farther from the dock.
Lex sat back, and sighed loudly with relief. Then s
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) looked stricken, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>) band over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>) mouth. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>) body shook, with muffled sounds: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>)
was suppressing a cough.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>) always coughed at the wrong times!
<div class="bookquote">``Lex,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim whispered fiercely, looking back toward
the shore.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>) head miserably, and pointed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>) th
roat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>) meant: a tickle in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>) throat. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>) needed was a drink of water. G
rant was rowing, and Tim leaned over the
side of the raft and scooped his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) hand in the lagoon
, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) cupped hand toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>).
Lex coughed loudly, explosively. In Tim's ears, the
sound echoed across the water like a
gunshot.
The tyrannosaur yawned lazily, and scratched behind
its ear with its hind foot, just like a dog. It
yawned again. It was groggy after its big meal, and
it woke up slowly.
On the boat, Lex was making little gargling sounds.
<div class="bookquote">``Lex,
shut up!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
<div class="bookquote">``I can't help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>) whispered, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>) coug
hed again. Grant rowed hard, moving the raft
powerfully into the center of the lagoon.
On the shore, the tyrannosaur stumbled to its feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't help it, Timmy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex shrieked miserably
. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't help it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shhhh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant was rowing as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could.
<div class="bookquote">``Anyway, it doesn't matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>) said. ``We're far e
nough away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Timmy</b></font>) can't swim.
``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Timmy</b></font>) can swim, you little idiot!'' Tim shou
ted at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>). On the shore, the tyrannosaur
stepped off the dock and plunged into the water. It
moved strongly into the lagoon after them.
``Well, how should I know?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>) said.
``Everybody knows tyrannosaurs can swim! It's in all
the books! Anyway, all reptiles can swim!''
``Snakes can't.''
``Of course snakes can. You idiot!''
``Settle down,'' Grant said. ``Hold on to something!''
Grant was watching the tyrannosaur,
noticing how the animal swam. The tyrannosaur was n
ow chest-deep in the water, but it could
hold its big head high above the surface. Then Gran
t realized the animal wasn't swimming, it was
walking, because moments later only the very top of
the head-the eyes and nostrils-protruded
above the surface. By then it looked like a crocodi
le, and it swam like a crocodile, swinging its big
tail back and forth, so the water churned behind it
. Behind the head, Grant saw the hump of the
back, and the ridges along the length of tail, as i
t occasionally broke the surface.
Exactly like a crocodile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) thought unhappily. The
biggest crocodile in the world.
``I'm sorry, Dr. Grant!'' Lex wailed. ``I didn't mean
it!''
Grant glanced over his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) shoulder. The lagoon was no
more than a hundred yards wide here,
and they had almost reached the center. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) conti
nued, the water would become shallow again.
The tyrannosaur would be able to walk again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
would move faster in shallow water. Grant
swung the boat around, and began to row north.
``What are you doing?''
The tyrannosaur was now just a few yards away. Gran
t could hear its sharp snorting breaths
as it came closer. Grant looked at the paddles in h
is hands, but they were light plastic-not
weapons at all.
The tyrannosaur threw its head back and opened its
jaws wide, showing rows of curved teeth,
and then in a great muscular spasm lunged forward t
o the raft, just missing the rubber gunwale,
the huge skull slapping down, the raft rocking away
on the crest of the splash.
The tyrannosaur sank below the surface, leaving gur
gling bubbles. The lagoon was still. Lex
gripped the gunwale handles and looked back.
``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) drown?''
``No,'' Grant said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw bubbles-then a faint rippl
e along the surface-coming toward the boat-
``Hang on!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) shouted, as the head bucked up beneat
h the rubber, bending the boat and lifting
it into the air, spinning them crazily before it sp
lashed down again.
``Do something!'' Alexis screamed. <div class="bookquote">``Do something!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Grant pulled the air pistol out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) belt. It loo
ked pitifully small in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) hands, but there was the

<p/>chance that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) shot the animal in a sensitive s
pot, in the eye or the nose-
The tyrannosaur surfaced beside the boat, opened it
s jaws, and roared. Grant aimed, and
fired. The dart flashed in the light, and smacked i
nto the cheek. The tyrannosaur shook its head,
and roared again.
And suddenly they heard an answering roar, floating
across the water toward them.
Looking back, Grant saw the juvenile T-rex on the s
hore, crouched over the killed sauropod,
claiming the kill as its own. The juvenile slashed
at the carcass, then raised its head high and
bellowed. The big tyrannosaur saw it, too, and the
response was immediate-it turned back to
protect its kill, swimming strongly toward the shor
e.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)'s going away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex squealed, clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) hands
. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)'s going away! Naah-naah-na-na-
naah! Stupid dinosaur!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>From the shore, the juvenile roared defiantly. Enra
ged, the big tyrannosaur burst from the
lagoon at full speed, water streaming from its enor
mous body as it raced up the hill past the dock.
The juvenile ducked its head and fled, its jaws sti
ll filled with ragged flesh.
The big tyrannosaur chased it, racing past the dead
sauropod, disappearing over the hill. They
heard its final threatening bellow, and then the ra
ft moved to the north, around a bend in the
lagoon, to the river.
Exhausted from rowing, Grant collapsed back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) ch
est heaving. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) couldn't catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) breath.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) lay gasping in the raft.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you okay, Dr. Grant?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex asked.
<div class="bookquote">``From now on, will you just do what I tell you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`Oh-kay, '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sighed, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had just made the m
ost unreasonable demand in the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
trailed her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) arm in the water for a while. ``You stop
ped rowing,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said.
``I'm tired,'' Grant said.
``Then how come we're still moving?''
Grant sat up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was right. The raft drifted stead
ily north. ``There must be a current.'' The
current was carrying them north, toward the hotel.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) watch and was astonished to
see it was fifteen minutes past seven. Only fifteen
minutes had passed since he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had last looked at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) watch. It seemed like two hours.
Grant lay back against the rubber gunwales, closed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) eyes, and slept.
FIFTH ITERATION
``Flaws in the system will now become severe.''
IAN MALCOM
Search
Gennaro sat in the Jeep and listened to the buzzing
of the flies, and stared at the distant palm
trees wavering in the heat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was astonished by wh
at looked like a battleground: the grass was
trampled flat for a hundred yards in every directio
n. One big palm tree was uprooted from the
ground. There were great washes of blood in the gra
ss, and on the rocky outcropping to their
right.
Sitting beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), Muldoon said, ``No doubt about i
t. Rexy's been among the hadrosaurs.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>)
took another drink of whiskey, and capped the bottl
e. ``Damn lot of flies,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said.
They waited, and watched.
Gennaro drummed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) fingers on the dashboard. ``What
are we waiting for?''
Muldoon didn't answer immediately. ``The rex is out
there somewhere,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said, squinting at
the landscape in the morning sun. ``And we don't hav
e any weapons worth a damn.''
``We're in a Jeep.''
``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) can outrun the Jeep, Mr. Gennaro,'' Muldoon
said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) head. ``Once we leave
this road and go onto open terrain, the best we can
do in a four-wheel drive is thirty, forty miles
an hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)'ll run us right down. No problem for hi
m.'' Muldoon sighed. ``But I don't see much
moving out there now. You ready to live dangerously
?''
``Sure,'' Gennaro said.
Muldoon started the engine, and at the sudden sound
, two small othnielians leapt up from the
matted grass directly ahead. Muldoon put the car in
gear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) drove in a wide circle around the
trampled site, and then moved inward, driving in de
creasing concentric circles until he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) finally
came to the place in the field where the little oth
nielians had been. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) got out and walked
forward in the grass, away from the Jeep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) stoppe
d as a dense cloud of flies lifted into the air.
``What is it?'' Gennaro called.
``Bring the radio,'' Muldoon said.
Gennaro climbed out of the Jeep and hurried forward
. Even from a distance he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) could smell the
sour-sweet odor of early decay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) saw a dark shape
in the grass, crusted with blood, legs
askew.
``Young hadrosaur,'' Muldoon said, staring down at th
e carcass. ``The whole herd stampeded,
and the young one got separated, and the T-rex brou
ght it down.''
``How do you know?'' Gennaro said. The flesh was ragg
ed from many bites.
``You can tell from the excreta,'' Muldoon said. ``See
those chalky white bits there in the grass?
That's hadro spoor. Uric acid makes it white. But y
ou look there''-he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) pointed to a large mound,
rising knee-high in the grass-``that's tyrannosaur s
poor.''
``How do you know the tyrannosaur didn't come later?
''
``The bite pattern,'' Muldoon said. ``See those little
ones there?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) pointed along the belly.
``Those are from the othys. Those bites haven't bled
. They're postmortem, from scavengers.
Othys did that. But the hadro was brought down by a
bite on the neck-you see the big slash
there, above the shoulder blades-and that's the T-r
ex, no question.''
Gennaro bent over the carcass, staring at the awkwa
rd, trampled limbs with a sense of
unreality. Beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>), Muldoon flicked on his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) radio
. ``Control. ''
``Yes,'' John Arnold said, over the radio.
``We got another hadro dead. Juvenile.'' Muldoon bent
down among the flies and checked the
skin on the sole of the right foot. A number was ta
ttooed there, ``Specimen is number HD/09.''
The radio crackled. ``I've got something for you,'' A
rnold said.
``Oh? What's that?''
``I found Nedry.''
The Jeep burst through the line of palm trees along
the east road and came out into a narrower
service road, leading toward the jungle river. It w
as hot in this area of the park, the jungle close
and fetid around them. Muldoon was fiddling with th
e computer monitor in the Jeep, which now
showed a map of the resort with overlaid grid lines
. ``They found him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) up on remote video,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>)
said. ``Sector 1104 is just ahead.''
Farther up the road, Gennaro saw a concrete barrier
, and the Jeep parked alongside it. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)
must have taken the wrong turnoff,<div class="bookquote">'' Muldoon said. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>The little bastard.''
``What'd he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) take?'' Gennaro asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Wu says fifteen embryos. Know what that's worth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><p/>Gennaro shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Somewhere between two and ten million,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon sa
id. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Big stakes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>As they came closer, Gennaro saw the body lying bes
ide the car. The body was indistinct and
green-but then green shapes scattered away, as the
Jeep pulled to a stop.
<div class="bookquote">``Compys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``The compys found him (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>dozen</b></font>)</div>A dozen procompsognathids, delicate little predator

out of the car.
Dennis Nedry lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) back, the chubby boyish fac
e now red and bloated. Flies buzzed
around the gaping mouth and thick tongue. His (<font color='blue'><b>Nedry</b></font>) body
was mangled-the intestines torn open, one
leg chewed through. Gennaro turned away quickly, to
look at the little compys, which squatted on
their hind legs a short distance away and watched t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) men curiously. The little dinosaurs had
five-fingered hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) noticed. They wiped their f

 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) smelled it.
<div class="bookquote">``That's dilo saliva,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``Spit from the
dilophosaurs. You see the damage on the

bastard. They blinded him (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>), then ripped him (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) down the

justice in the world after all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>The procompsognatbids squeaked and hopped up and do

door and took out gray metal tubing and a stainless

handed two dark cylinders to Gennaro.
<div class="bookquote">``What're these?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``Just what they look like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``Rockets.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Gennaro stepped carefully over Nedry's body. Muldoo

<div class="bookquote">``What about him (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>bod</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``We've got things t
o do.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) put the car in gear. Looking
back, Gennaro saw the compys resume their feeding.
One jumped up and squatted on Nedry's
open mouth as it nibbled the flesh of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) nose.
The jungle river became narrower. The banks closed
in on both sides until the trees and foliage
overhanging the banks met high above to block out t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) sun. Tim heard the cry of birds, and saw
small chirping dinosaurs leaping among the branches
. But mostly it was silent, the air hot and still
beneath the canopy of trees.
Grant looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) watch. It was eight o'clock.
They drifted along peacefully, among dappled patche
s of light. If anything, they seemed to be
moving faster than before. Awake now, Grant lay on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) back and stared up at the branches
overhead. In the how, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) reaching up.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, wbat're you doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``You think we can eat these berries?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) pointed t
o the trees. Some of the overhanging
branches were close enough to touch. Tim saw cluste
rs of bright red berries on the branches.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
<div class="bookquote">``Why? Those little dinosaurs are eating them.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
pointed to small dinosaurs, scampering in
the branches.
<div class="bookquote">``No, Lex.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sighed, dissatisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) authority. <div class="bookquote">``I wis
h Daddy was here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Daddy always

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What're you talking about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) never kn

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sighed. Lex stared at the trees
as they slid past, their big roots twisting
toward the water's edge. <div class="bookquote">``Just because you're not h
is favorite ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim turned away, said nothing.
<div class="bookquote">``But don't worry, Daddy likes you, too. Even if you
're into computers and not sports.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dad's a real sports nut,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim explained to Grant.
Grant nodded. Up in the branches, small pale yellow
dinosaurs, barely two feet tall, hopped
from tree to tree. They had beaky heads, like parro
ts. <div class="bookquote">``You know what they call those?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
<div class="bookquote">``Microceratops.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Big deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``I thought you might be interested.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only very young boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``are interested i

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Says who?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Daddy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim started to yell, but Grant raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) band. <div class="bookquote">``Ki

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, <div class="bookquote">``I can do what I want, if I-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) fell silent, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heard it, too. It
was a bloodcurdling shriek, from somewhere
downriver.
Well, where the hell is the damn rex?'' Muldoon said
, talking into the radio. ``Because we don't
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) here.'' They were back at the sauropod compo
und, looking out at the trampled grass
where the hadrosaurs had stampeded. The tyrannosaur
was nowhere to be found.
``Checking now,'' Arnold said, and clicked off.
Muldoon turned to Gennaro. ``Checking now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) repea
ted sarcastically. ``Why the hell didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)
check before? Why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) keep track of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)?''
``I don't know,'' Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'s not showing up,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Arnold said, a moment later.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'s not showing up?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'s not on the monitors. Motion sensors aren't fi

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Motion sensors aren't finding them, either.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, what are we supposed to do now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon sai
d.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Arnold said.
<div class="bookquote">``Look! Look!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Directly ahead, the big dome of the aviary rose abo
ve them. Grant had seen it only from a
distance; now he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) realized it was enormous-a quarter
of a mile in diameter or more. The pattern of
geodesic struts shone dully through the light mist,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) first thought was that the glass must
weigh a ton. Then, as they came closer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw ther
e wasn't any glass-just struts. A thin mesh
hung inside the elements.
<div class="bookquote">``It isn't finished,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``I think it's meant to be open like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant sa
id.
<div class="bookquote">``Then all the birds can fly out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not if they're big birds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
The river carried them beneath the edge of the dome
. They stared upward. Now they were
inside the dome, still drifting down the river. But
`thin minutes the dome was so high above them
that it was hardly visible in the mist. Grant said,
<div class="bookquote">``I seem to remember there's a second lodge
here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Moments later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw the roof of a building
over the tops of the trees to the north.
<div class="bookquote">``You want to stop?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
<div class="bookquote">``Maybe there's a phone. Or motion sensors.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant s
teered toward the shore. <div class="bookquote">``We need to try
to contact the control room. It's getting late.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>They clambered out, slipping on the muddy bank, and
Grant hauled the raft out of the water.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) tied the rope to a tree and they set off, t
hrough a dense forest of palm trees.

<div class="bookquote">``I just don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Arnold</b></font>)</div>John Arnold said, speaki

don't see Grant and the kids anywhere, either.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) sat in front of the consoles and gulped another
cup of coffee. All around him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>), the control
room was strewn with paper plates and half-eaten sa
ndwiches. Arnold was exhausted. It was
8:00 a.m. on Saturday. In the fourteen hours since
Nedry destroyed the computer that ran
Jurassic Park, Arnold had patiently pulled systems
back on line, one after another. <div class="bookquote">``All the park
systems are back, and functioning correctly. The ph
ones are working. I've called for a doctor for

 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>On the other end of the line, Malcolm coughed. Arno
ld was talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) room at the
lodge. <div class="bookquote">``But you're having trouble with the motion s

 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said. <div class="bookquote">``But if you put the remaining

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't imagine they'd be on the river. The banks

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but it's not the safest way to go, because it

 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why wasn't the aviary on the tour?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said.
<div class="bookquote">``We've had problems setting it up. Originally the p
ark was intended to have a treetop lodge
built high above the ground, where visitors could o
bserve the pterodactyls at flight level. We've

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, while we finished the lodge, we put the dact

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's impressive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``The dactyls glide

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That doesn't injure the dactyls?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not so far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They're not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. <div class="bookquote">``At least, I hope they'
re not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that the lodge?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``What a dump.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Beneath the aviary dome, Pteratops Lodge was built
high above the ground, on big wooden
pylons, in the middle of a stand of fir trees. But
the building was unfinished and unpainted; the
windows were boarded up. The trees and the lodge we
re splattered with broad white streaks.
<div class="bookquote">``I guess they didn't finish it, for some reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>G
rant said, hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) disappointment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)
glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``Come on, let's go back to th
e boat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The sun came out as they walked along, making the m
orning more cheerful. Grant looked at
the latticework shadows on the ground from the dome
above, He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) noticed that the ground and the
foliage were spattered with broad streaks of the sa
me white chalky substance that had been on
the building. And there was a distinctive, sour odo
r in the morning air.
<div class="bookquote">``Stinks here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``What's all the white stuf
f?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Looks like reptile droppings. Probably from the bi
rds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How come they didn't finish the lodge?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They entered a clearing of low grass, dotted with w
ild flowers. They heard a long, low whistle.
Then an answering whistle, from across the forest.
<div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``I don't

<p/>know.''
Then Grant saw the dark shadow of a cloud on the gr
assy field ahead. The shadow was
moving fast. In moments, it had swept over them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
looked up and saw an enormous dark
shape gliding above them, blotting out the sun.
``Yew!'' Lex said. ``Is it a pterodactyl?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div><p/>Tim said.
Grant didn't answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was entranced by the sight
of the huge flying creature. In the sky
above, the pterodactyl gave a low whistle and wheel
ed gracefully, turning back toward them.
<div class="bookquote">``How come they're not on the tour?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
Grant was wondering the same thing. The flying dino
saurs were so beautiful, so graceful as
they moved through the air. As Grant watched, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sa
w a second pterodactyl appear in the sky,
and a third, and a fourth.
<div class="bookquote">``Maybe because they didn't finish the lodge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex s
aid.
Grant was thinking these weren't ordinary pterodact
yls. They were too large. They must
cearadactyls, big flying reptiles from the early Cr
etaceous. When they were high, these looked
like small airplanes. When they came lower, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) coul
d see the animals had fifteen-foot wingspans,
furry bodies, and heads like crocodiles. They ate f
ish, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) remembered. South America and
Mexico.
Lex shaded her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) eyes and looked up at the sky. <div class="bookquote">``Can
they hurt us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't think so. They eat fish.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>One of the dactyls spiraled down, a flashing dark s
hadow that whooshed past them with a rush
of warm air and a lingering sour odor.
<div class="bookquote">``Wow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``They're really big.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``Are you sure they can't hurt us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pretty sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A second dactyl swooped down, moving faster than th
e first. It came from behind, streaked
over their heads. Grant had a glimpse of its toothy
beak and the furry body. It looked like a huge
bat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) thought. But Grant was impressed with the f
rail appearance of the animals. Their huge
wingspans-the delicate pink membranes stretched acr
oss them-so thin they were translucent-
everything reinforced the delicacy of the dactyls.
<div class="bookquote">``Ow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex shouted, grabbing her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hair. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) bit me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) bit me! He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) bit me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) band away
, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw blood on her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) fingers.
Up in the sky, two more dactyls folded their wings,
collapsing into small dark shapes that
plummeted toward the ground. They made a kind of sc
ream as they hurtled downward.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said, grabbing their hands. They r
an across the meadow, bearing the
approaching scream, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) flung himself on the gro
und at the last moment, pulling the kids
down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), as the two dactyls whistled and sque
aked past them, flapping their wings. Grant
felt claws tear the shirt along his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) back.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was up, pulling Lex back onto her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) feet, and
running with Tim a few feet forward while
overhead two more birds wheeled and dove toward the
m, screaming. At the last moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
pushed the kids to the ground, and the big shadows
flapped past.
<div class="bookquote">``Uck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, disgusted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was str
eaked with white droppings from the birds.
Grant scrambled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``Come on!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was about to run when Lex shrieked in terror. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
turned back and saw that one of the
dactyls had grabbed her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) by the shoulders with its h
ind claws. The animal's huge leathery wings,
translucent in the sunlight, flapped broadly on bot
h sides of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>). The dactyl was trying to take off,
but Lex was too heavy, and while it struggled it re
peatedly jabbed at her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) head with its long
pointed jaw.
Lex was screaming, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) arms wildly. Grant di
d the only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could think to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
ran forward and jumped up, throwing himself against
the body of the dactyl. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) knocked it onto
its back on the ground, and fell on top of the furr
y body. The animal screamed and snapped;
Grant ducked his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head away from the jaws and pushed
back, as the giant wings beat around his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
body. It was like being in a tent In a windstorm. H
e couldn't see; he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) couldn't hear; there was
nothing but the flapping and shrieking and the leat
hery membranes. The clawed legs scratched
frantically at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) chest. Lex was screaming. Grant
pushed away from the dactyl and it squeaked
and gibbered as it flapped its wings and struggled
to turn over, to right itself. Finally it pulled in
its
wings like a bat and rolled over, lifted itself up
on its little wing claws, and began to walk that wa
y.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) paused, astonished.
It could walk on its wings! Lederer's speculation w
as right! But then the other dactyls were
diving down at them and Grant was dizzy, off balanc
e, and in horror he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw Lex run away, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
arms over her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head ... Tim shouting at the top of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) lungs... .
The first of them swooped down and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) threw someth
ing and suddenly the dactyl whistled
and climbed. The other dactyls immediately climbed
and chased the first into the sky. The fourth
dactyl flapped awkwardly into the air to join the o
thers. Grant looked upward, squinting to see
what had happened. The three dactyls chased the fir
st, screaming angrily.
They were alone in the field. ``What

<p/>happened?'' Grant said.
``They got my glove,'' Lex said. ``My Darryl Strawberr
y special.''
They started walking again. Tim put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) arm around
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shoulders. ``Are you all right?''
``Of course, stupid,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) off. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
looked upward. ``I hope they choke and die,''
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said.
``Yeah,'' Tim said. ``Me, too-''
Up ahead, they saw the boat on the shore. Grant loo
ked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) watch. It was eight-thirty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
now had two and a half hours to get back.
Lex cheered as they drifted beyond the silver aviar
y dome. Then the banks of the river closed in
on both sides, the trees meeting overhead once more
. The river was narrower than ever, in some
places only ten feet wide, and the current flowed v
ery fast. Lex reached up to touch the branches
as they went past.
Grant sat back in the raft and listened to the gurg
le of the water through the warm rubber. They
were moving faster now, the branches overhead slipp
ing by more rapidly. It was pleasant. It gave a
little breeze in the hot confines of the overhangin
g branches. And it meant they would get back that
much sooner.
Grant couldn't guess how far they had come, but it
must be several miles at least from the
sauropod building where they had spent the night. P
erhaps four or five miles. Maybe even more.
That meant they might be only an hour's walk from t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) hotel, once they left the raft. But after the
aviary, Grant was in no hurry to leave the river ag
ain. For the moment, they were making good
time.
``I wonder how Ralph is,'' Lex said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>)'s probably d
ead or something.''
``I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>)'s fine.''
``I wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>)'d let me ride him (<font color='blue'><b>Ralph</b></font>).'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sighed, sle
epy in the sun. ``That would be fun, to ride
Ralph.''
Tim said to Grant, ``Remember back at the stegosauru
s? Last night?''
``Yes.''
``How come you asked them about frog DNA?''
``Because of the breeding,'' Grant said. ``They can't
explain why the dinosaurs are breeding,
since they irradiate them, and since they're all fe
males.''
``Right.''
``Well, irradiation is notoriously unreliable and pr
obably doesn't work. I think that'll eventually be
shown here. But there is still the problem of the d
inosaurs' being female. How can they breed
when they're all female?''
``Right,'' Tim said.
``Well, across the animal kingdom, sexual reproducti
on exists in extraordinary variety.''
``Tim's very interested in sex,'' Lex said.
They both ignored her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). ``For example,<div class="bookquote">'' Grant said, ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>many animals have sexual reproduction
without ever having what we would call sex. The mal
e releases a spermatophore, which contains
the sperm, and the female picks it up at a later ti
me. This kind of exchange does not require quite
as much physical differentiation between male and f
emale as we usually think exists. Male and
female are more alike in some animals than they are
in human beings.''
Tim nodded. ``But what about the frogs?''
Grant heard sudden shrieks from the trees above, as
the microceratopsians scattered in alarm,
shaking the branches. The big head of the tyrannosa
ur lunged through the foliage from the left,
the jaws snapping at the raft. Lex howled in terror
, and Grant paddled away toward the opposite
bank, but the river here was only ten feet wide. Th
e tyrannosaur was caught in the heavy growth- it
butted and twisted its head, and roared. Then it pu
lled its head back.
Through the trees that lined the riverbank, they sa
w the huge dark form of the tyrannosaur,
moving north, looking for a gap in the trees that l
ined the bank. The microceratopsians had all
gone to the opposite bank, where they shrieked and
scampered and jumped up and down. In the
raft, Grant, Tim, and Lex stared helplessly as the
tyrannosaur tried to break through again, But
the trees were too dense along the banks of the riv
er. The tyrannosaur again moved
downstream, ahead of the boat, and tried again, sha
king the branches furiously.
But again it failed.
Then it moved off, heading farther downstream. ``I

<p/>hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>),'' Lex said.
Grant sat back in the boat, badly shaken. If the ty
rannosaur had broken through, there was
nothing be could have done to save them. The river
was so narrow that it was hardly wider than
the raft. It was like being in a tunnel. The rubber
gunwales often scraped on the mud as the boat
was pulled along by the swift current.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) watch. Almost nine. The raft cont
inued downstream.
``Hey,'' Lex said, ``listen!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) heard snarling, interspersed by a repeated hooti
ng cry. The cries were coming from beyond
a curve, farther downriver. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) listened, and heard
the hooting again.
``What is it?'' Lex said.
``I don't know,'' Grant said. ``But there's more than
one of them.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) paddled the boat to the
opposite bank, grabbed a branch to stop the raft. T
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) snarling was repeated. Then more hooting.
``It sounds like a bunch of owls,'' Tim said.
Malcolm groaned. ``Isn't it time for more morphine y
et?''
``Not yet,'' Ellie said.
Malcolm sighed. ``How much water have we got here?''
``I don't know. There's plenty of running water from
the tap-''
``No, I mean, how much stored? Any?''
Ellie shrugged. ``None.''
``Go into the rooms on this floor,'' Malcolm said, ``a
nd fill the bathtubs with water.''
Ellie frowned.
``Also,'' Malcolm said, ``have we got any walkie-talki
es? Flashlights? Matches? Sterno stoves?
Things like that?''
<div class="bookquote">``I'll look around. You planning for an earthquake?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said. <div class="bookquote">``Malcolm Effec

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think it's just human nature?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie sai
d.
<div class="bookquote">``God, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said. ``That's like saying scramb

nature. It's nothing of the sort. It's uniquely Wes
tern training, and much of the rest of the world is

<p/>nauseated by the thought of it.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) winced in pain.
``The morphine's making me philosophical.''
``You want some water?''
``No. I'll tell you the problem with engineers and s
cientists. Scientists have an elaborate line of
bullshit about how they are seeking to know the tru
th about nature. Which is true, but that's not
what drives them. Nobody is driven by abstractions
like `seeking truth.'
``Scientists are actually preoccupied with accomplis
hment. So they are focused on whether
they can do something. They never stop to ask if th
ey should do something. They conveniently
define such considerations as pointless. If they do
n't do it, someone else will. Discovery, they
believe, is inevitable. So they just try to do it f
irst. That's the game in science. Even pure scienti
fic
discovery is an aggressive, penetrative act. It tak
es big equipment, and it literally changes the
world afterward. Particle accelerators sear the lan
d, and leave radioactive byproducts. Astronauts
leave trash on the moon. There is always some proof
that scientists were there, making their
discoveries. Discovery is always a rape of the natu
ral world. Always.
``The scientists want it that way. They have to stic
k their instruments in. They have to leave
their mark. They can't just watch. They can't just
appreciate. They can't just fit into the natural
order. They have to make something unnatural happen
. That is the scientist's job, and now we
have whole societies that try to be scientific.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>)
sighed, and sank back.
Ellie said, ``Don't you think you're overstating-''
``What does one of your excavations look like a year
later?''
``Pretty had,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) admitted.
``You don't replant, you don't restore the land afte

``No.''
``Why not?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) shrugged. ``There's no money, I guess...

 (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said nothing.
<div class="bookquote">``Because there haven't been any advances,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm

<div class="bookquote">``That's the last thing I would worry about.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>In the dark tunnel of the jungle river, Grant went
hand over hand, holding branches, moving the
raft cautiously forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) still heard the sounds.
And finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw the dinosaurs.
<div class="bookquote">``Aren't those the ones that are poison?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``Dilophosaurus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Standing on the riverbank were two dilophosaurs. Th
e ten-foot-tall bodies were spotted yellow
and black. Underneath, the bellies were bright gree
n, like lizards. Twin red curving crests ran
along the top of the head from the eyes to the nose
, making a V shape above the head. The bird-
like quality was reinforced by the way they moved,
bending to drink from the river, then rising to
snarl and hoot.
Lex whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Should we get out and walk?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Grant shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head no. The dilophosaurs were smal
ler than the tyrannosaur, small enough
to slip through the dense foliage at the banks of t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) river. And they seemed quick, as they
snarled and hooted at each other.
<div class="bookquote">``But we can't get past them in the boat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``They're poison.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We have to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``Somehow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The dilophosaurs continued to drink and hoot. They
seemed to be interacting with each other
in a strangely ritualistic, repetitive way. The ani
mal on the left would bend to drink, opening its
mouth to bare long rows of sharp teeth, and then it
would hoot. The animal on the right would
boot in reply and bend to drink, in a mirror image
of the first animal's movements. Then the
sequence would be repeated, exactly the same way.
Grant noticed that the animal on the right was smal
ler, with smaller spots on its back, and its
crest was a duller red-
<div class="bookquote">``I'll be damned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's a mating ritual.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can
we get past them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Not the way they are now. They're right by the edg
e of the water.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant knew animals often
performed such mating rituals for hours at a time.
They went without food, they paid attention to
nothing else... . He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) watch. Nine-t
wenty.
<div class="bookquote">``What do we do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
Grant sighed. <div class="bookquote">``I have no idea.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sat down in the raft, and then the dilopbosaurs
began to bonk and roar repeatedly, in
agitation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) looked up. The animals were both faci
ng away from the river.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
Grant smiled, <div class="bookquote">``I think we're finally getting some h
elp.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) pushed off from the bank. <div class="bookquote">``I want you
two kids to lie flat on the rubber. We'll go past a
s fast as we can. But just remember: whatever
happens, don't say anything, and don't move- Okay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The raft began to drift downstream, toward the hoot
ing dilophosaurs. It gained speed. Lex lay at
Grant's feet, staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) with friehtened eyes.
They were coming closer to the dilophosaurs,
which were still turned away from the river. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) air pistol, checked the chamber.
The raft continued on, and they smelled a peculiar
odor, sweet and nauseating at the same
time. It smelled like dried vomit. The hooting of t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) dilophosaurs was louder. The raft came
around a final bend and Grant caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) breath. Th
e dilophosaurs were just a few feet away,
honking at the trees beyond the river.
As Grant had suspected, they were honking at the ty
rannosaur. The tyrannosaur was trying to
break through the foliage, and the dilos hooted and
stomped their feet in the mud. The raft drifted
past them. The smell was nauseating. The tyrannosau
r roared, probably because it saw the raft.
But in another moment ...
A thump.
The raft stopped moving. They were aground, against
the riverbank, just a few feet
downstream from the dilophosaurs.
Lex whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, great ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>There was a long slow scraping sound of the raft ag
ainst the mud. Then the raft was moving
again. They were going down the river. The tyrannos
aur roared a final time and moved off; one
dilophosaur looked surprised, then hooted. The othe
r dilophosaur hooted in reply.
The raft floated downriver.
Tyrannosaur
The Jeep bounced along in the glaring sun. Muldoon
was driving, with Gennaro at his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) side. They
were in an open field, moving away from the dense l
ine of foliage and palm trees that marked the
course of the river, a hundred yards to the east. T
hey came to a rise, and Muldoon stopped the
car.
<div class="bookquote">``Christ, it's hot,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) forehead wi
th the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) drank from the bottle of

<p/>whiskey between his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) knees, then offered it to Genna
ro.
Gennaro shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) stared at the landscape
shimmering in the morning heat. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
looked down at the onboard computer and video monit

showed views of the park from remote cameras. Still
no sign of Grant and the children. Or of the
tyrannosaur.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They came to a wrenching stop. Through the windshie
ld, Gennaro saw the tyrannosaur directly
ahead of them, moving among the palm trees along th
e river.
Muldoon drained the whiskey bottle and threw it in
the back seat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) reached back for his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>)
tubing. Gennaro looked at the video monitor, which
showed their Jeep and the tyrannosaur.
There must be a closed-circuit camera in the trees
somewhere behind.
<div class="bookquote">``You want to help,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said, <div class="bookquote">``you can break ou

 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Gennaro bent over and opened a stainless-steel Hall
iburton case. It was padded inside with
foam. Four cylinders, each the size of a quart milk
bottle, were nestled in the foam. They were all
labeled MORO-709. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) took one out.
<div class="bookquote">``You snap off the tip and screw on a needle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Muldo

Gennaro found a plastic package of large needles, e
ach the diameter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) fingertip. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
screwed one onto the canister. The opposite end of
the canister had a circular lead weight.

sat forward with the air rifle across his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>)

car and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'ll drop dead from adrenaline shock. Stra
nge combination of tough and delicate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon drove slowly toward the river, moving close
r to the tyrannosaur. <div class="bookquote">``But those are all
mammals. We know a lot about handling mammals, beca

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You consider them reptiles?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said, shifting gears. <div class="bookquote">``Dinosaurs don'

avoid a rock. <div class="bookquote">``Actually, what we find is, the dinos

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Like the raptors?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
Muldoon nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Raptors are smart, Very smart. Bel

holding pen. Ah. I think this is as close as we can
get to our Rexy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Up ahead, the tyrannosaur was poking its head throu
gh the branches, peering toward the river.
Trying to get through. Then the animal moved a few
yards downstream, to try again,
<div class="bookquote">``Wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) sees in there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``Hard to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)'s trying to
get to the microceratopsians that
scramble around in the branches. They'll run him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) a
merry chase.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon stopped the Jeep about fifty yards away fro
m the tyrannosaur, and turned the vehicle
around. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) left the motor running. <div class="bookquote">``Get behind the
wheel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``And put your seat belt
on.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) took another canister and booked it onto hi
s shirt. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) got out.
Gennaro slid behind the wheel. <div class="bookquote">``You done this very
often before?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon belched. <div class="bookquote">``Never. I'll try to get him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) just b
ehind the auditory meatus. We'll see how it
goes from there.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) walked ten yards behind the Je
ep and crouched down in the grass on one
knee. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) steadied the big gun against his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) shoulder,
and flipped up the thick telescopic sight.
Muldoon aimed at the tyrannosaur, which still ignor
ed them.
There was a burst of pale gas, and Gennaro saw a wh
ite streak shoot forward in the air toward
the tyrannosaur. But nothing seemed to happen.
Then the tyrannosaur turned slowly, curiously, to p
eer at them. It moved its head from side to
side, as if looking at them with alternate eyes.
Muldoon had taken down the launcher, and was loadin
g the second canister.
<div class="bookquote">``You hit him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
Muldoon shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Missed. Damn laser sights
... See if there's a battery in the case.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``A battery,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``It's about as big as yo
ur finger. Gray markings.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro bent over to look in the steel case. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) fel
t the vibration of the Jeep, heard the motor
ticking over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) didn't see a battery. The tyrannos
aur roared. To Gennaro it was a terrifying
sound, rumbling from the great chest cavity of the
animal, bellowing out over the landscape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
sat up sharply and reached for the steering wheel,
put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) hand on the gearshift. On the radio, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
heard a voice say, <div class="bookquote">``Muldoon. This is Arnold. Get ou
t of there. Over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know what I'm doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. The

<p/>tyrannosaur charged.
Muldoon stood his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) ground. Despite the creature raci
ng toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) slowly and methodically
raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) launcher, aimed, and fired. Once again,
Gennaro saw the puff of smoke, and the white
streak of the canister going toward the animal.
Nothing happened. The tyrannosaur continued to char
ge.
Now Muldoon was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) feet and running, shouting,
<div class="bookquote">``Go! Go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Gennaro put the Jeep in gear
and Muldoon threw himself onto the side door as the
Jeep lurched forward. The tyrannosaur was
closing rapidly, and Muldoon swung the door open an
d climbed inside.
<div class="bookquote">``Go, damn it! Go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro floored it. The Jeep bounced precariously,
the front end nosing so high they saw only
sky through the windshield, then slamming down agai
n toward the ground and racing forward
again. Gennaro headed for a stand of trees to the l
eft until, in the rearview mirror, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) saw the
tyrannosaur give a final roar and turn away.
Gennaro slowed the car. <div class="bookquote">``Jesus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon was shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I could have sworn I
hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) the second time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'd say you missed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``Needle must have broken off before the plunger inj

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Admit it, you missed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``I missed. Battery
was dead in the damned laser sights. My
fault. I should have checked it, after it was out a
ll last night. Let's go back and get more
canisters.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The Jeep headed north, toward the hotel. Muldoon pi
cked up the radio. <div class="bookquote">``Control.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnold/Mr. Arnold</b></font>)</div>Arnold said.
<div class="bookquote">``We're heading back to base.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The river was now very narrow, and flowing swiftly.
The raft was going faster all the time. It was
starting to feel like an amusement park ride.
<div class="bookquote">``Whee!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex yelled, holding on to the gunwale. <div class="bookquote">``Fas
ter, faster!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant squinted, looking forward. The river was stil
l narrow and dark, but farther ahead he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could
see the trees ended, and there was bright sunlight
beyond, and a distant roaring sound. The river
seemed to end abruptly in a peculiar flat line...
.
The raft was going still faster, rushing forward. G
rant
grabbed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) paddles.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's a waterfall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
The raft swept out of the overhanging darkness into
brilliant morning sunlight, and raced
forward on the swift current toward the lip of the
waterfall. The roar was loud in their ears. Grant
paddled as strongly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) only succee
ded in spinning the boat in circles. It
continued inexorably toward the lip.
Lex leaned toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I can't swim!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant saw th
at she (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) did not have her (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) life vest clasped,
but there was nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could do about it; with fr
ightening speed, they came to the edge, and
the roar of the waterfall seemed to fill the world.
Grant jammed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) oar deep into the water, it
catch and hold, right at the lip; the rubber raft s
huddered in the current, but they did not go over.
Grant strained against the oar and, looking over th
e edge, saw the sheer drop of fifty feet down to
the surging pool below.
And standing in the surging pool, waiting for them,
was the tyrannosaur.
Lex was screaming in panic, and then the boat spun,
and the rear end dropped away, spilling
them out into air and roaring water, and they fell
sickeningly. Grant flailed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) arms in the air, and

<p/>the world went suddenly silent and slow.
It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) fell for long minutes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had t
ime to observe Lex, clutching her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) orange jacket,
falling alongside him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had time to observe Tim,
looking down at the bottom; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had time to
observe the frozen white sheet of the waterfall; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
had time to observe the bubbling pool beneath
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) fell slowly, silently toward it.
Then, with a stinging slap, Grant plunged into cold
water, surrounded by white boiling bubbles.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) tumbled and spun and glimpsed the leg of the tyr
annosaur as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was swirled past it, swept
down through the pool and out into the stream beyon
d. Grant swam for the shore, clutched warm
rocks, slipped off, caught a branch, and finally pu
lled himself out of the main current. Gasping, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
dragged himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) belly onto the rocks, and lo
oked at the river just in time to see the brown
rubber raft tumble past him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw Tim, battl
ing the current, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) reached out and pulled
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), coughing and shivering, onto the shore beside
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>).
Grant turned back to the waterfall, and saw the tyr
annosaur plunge its head straight down into
the water of the pool at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) feet. The great head s
hook, splashing water to either side. It had
something between its teeth.
And then the tyrannosaur lifted its head back up. D
angling from the jaws was Lex's orange life
vest.
A moment later, Lex bobbed to the surface beside th
e dinosaur's long tail. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) lay face down in
the water, her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) little body swept downstream by the
current. Grant plunged into the water after her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>),
was again immersed in the churning torrent. A momen
t later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) up onto the rocks, a
heavy, lifeless weight. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) face was gray. Water po
ured from her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) mouth.
Grant bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) mouth-to-mouth but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) coughed. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) vomited yellow-
green liquid and coughed again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) eyelids flutter
ed. <div class="bookquote">``Hi,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) smiled weakly. <div class="bookquote">``We did
it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim started to cry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) coughed again. <div class="bookquote">``Will you st
op it? What're you crying for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We were worried about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. Small flec
ks of white were drifting down the river.
The tyrannosaur was tearing up the life vest. Still
turned away from them, facing the waterfall. But
at any minute the animal might turn and see them. .
. . Come on, kids,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said.
``Where are we going?'' Lex said, coughing.
``Come on.<div class="bookquote">'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) was looking for a hiding place. Downs
tream he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) saw only an open grassy plain,
affording no protection. Upstream was the dinosaur.
Then Grant saw a dirt path by the river. It
seemed to lead up toward the waterfall.
And in the dirt he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw the clear imprint of a man's
shoe. Leading up the path.
The tyrannosaur finally turned around, growling and
looking out toward the grassy plain. It
seemed to have figured out that they had gotten awa
y.
It was looking for them downstream. Grant and the k
ids ducked among the big ferns that lined
the riverbanks. Cautiously, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) led them upstream. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Where are we going?'' Lex said. ``We're going
back.''
``I know.''
They were closer to the waterfall now, the roar muc
h louder. The rocks became slippery, the
path muddy. There was a constant hanging mist. It w
as like moving through a cloud. The path
seemed to lead right into the rushing water, but as
they came closer, they saw that it actually
went behind the waterfall.
The tyrannosaur was still looking downstream, its b
ack turned to them. They hurried along the
path to the waterfall, and had almost moved behind
the sheet of falling water when Grant saw the
tyrannosaur turn. Then they were completely behind
the waterfall, and Grant was unable to see
out through the silver sheet.
Grant looked around in surprise. There was a little
recess here, hardly larger than a closet, and
filled with machinery: humming pumps and big filter
s and pipes. Everything was wet, and cold.
``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) see us?'' Lex said. She (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had to shout over th
e noise of the falling water. ``Where are
we? What is this place? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) see us?''
``Just a minute,'' Grant said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was looking at the
equipment. This was clearly park machinery.
And there must be electricity to run it, so perhaps
there was also a telephone for communication.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) poked among the filters and pipes.
``What are you doing?'' Lex shouted.
``Looking for a telephone.'' It was now nearly 10:00
a.m.. They had just a little more than an
hour to contact the ship before it reached the main
land.
In the back of the recess he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) found a metal door mar
ked MAINT 04, but it was firmly locked.
Next to it was a slot for a security card. Alongsid
e the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) saw a row of metal boxes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
opened the boxes one after another, but they contai
ned only switches and timers. No telephone.
And nothing to open the door.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) almost missed the box to the left of the door. O
n opening it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) found a nine-button keypad,
covered with spots of green mold. But it looked as
if it was a way to open the door, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had
the feeling that on the other side of that door was
a phone. Scratched in the metal of the box was
the number 1023. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) punched it in.
With a hiss, the door came open. Gaping darkness be
yond, concrete steps leading downward.
On the back wall he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) saw stenciled MAINT VEHICLE 04/
22 CHARGER and an arrow pointing
down the stairs. Could it really mean there was a c
ar? ``Come on, kids.''
``Forget it,'' Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not going in there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, Lex,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
<div class="bookquote">``Forget it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``There's no lights or anythi
ng. I'm not going.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. There wasn't time to argu
e. <div class="bookquote">``Stay here, and I'll be right back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where're you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, suddenly alarmed.
Grant stepped through the door. It gave an electron
ic beep, and snapped shut behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), on
a spring.
Grant was plunged into total darkness. After a mome
nt of surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) turned to the door and
felt its damp surface. There was no knob, no latch.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) turned to the walls on either side of the
door, feeling for a switch, a control box, anything
at all... .
There was nothing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was fighting panic when his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) fingers closed over
a cold metal cylinder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) hands
over a swelling edge, a flat surface ... a flashl
ight! He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) clicked it on, and the beam was
surprisingly bright. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) looked back at the door, bu
t saw that it would not open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) would have to
wait for the kids to unlock it. Meantime ...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) started for the steps. They were damp and slippe
ry with mold, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) went down carefully.
Partway down the stairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heard a sniffing and th
e sound of claws scratching on concrete. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) dart pistol, and proceeded cautiously.

<p/>The steps bent around the corner, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) shone h
is light, an odd reflection glinted back,
and then, a moment later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw it: a car! It was
an electric car, like a golf cart, and it faced a
long tunnel that seemed to stretch away for miles.
A bright red light glowed by the steering wheel of
the car, so perhaps it was charged.
Grant heard the sniffing again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) wheeled and
saw a pale shape rise up toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>),
leaping through the air, its laws open, and without
thinking Grant fired. The animal landed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>),
knocking him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) rolled away in fright, hi
s flashlight swinging wildly. But the animal
didn't get up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) felt foolish when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw it.
It was a velociraptor, but very young, less than a
year old. It was about two feet tall, the size of
a medium dog, and it lay on the ground, breathing s
hallowly, the dart sticking from beneath its
jaw. There was probably too much anesthetic for its
body weight, and Grant pulled the dart out
quickly. The velociraptor looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) with slight
ly glazed eyes.
Grant had a clear feeling of intelligence from this
creature, a kind of softness which contrasted
strangely with the menace he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had felt from the adul
ts in the pen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) stroked the head of the
velociraptor, hoping to calm it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) looked down at
the body, which was shivering slightly as the
tranquilizer took hold. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw it was a ma
le.
A young juvenile, and a male. There was no question
what he (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) was seeing. This velociraptor
had been bred in the wild.
Excited by this development, he (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) hurried back up the
stairs to the door. With his (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) flashlight, he (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>)
scanned the flat, featureless surface of the door,
and the interior walls. As he (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) ran his (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) hands over
the door, it slowly dawned on him (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) was locke
d inside, and unable to open it, unless the
kids had the presence of mind to open it for him (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>). H
e could hear them, faintly, on the other side of
the door.
<div class="bookquote">``Dr. Grant!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex shouted, pounding the door. <div class="bookquote">``Dr. G
rant!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Take it easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)'ll be back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But where did he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) go?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Listen, Dr. Grant knows what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)'s doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said
. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)'ll be back in a minute.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) should come back now, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. She (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) bunched h
er fists on her (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) hips, pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) elbows
wide. She (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) foot angrily.
And then, with a roar, the tyrannosaur's head burst
through the waterfall toward them.
Tim stared in horror as the big mouth gaped wide. L
ex shrieked and threw herself on the
ground. The head swung back and forth, and pulled o
ut again. But Tim could see the shadow of
the animal's head on the sheet of falling water.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) pulled Lex deeper into the recess, just as the j
aws burst through again, roaring, the thick
tongue flicking in and out rapidly. Water sprayed i
n all directions from the head. Then it pulled out
again.
Lex huddled next to Tim, shivering. <div class="bookquote">``I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>s
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) huddled back, but the recess
was only a few feet deep, and crammed with machiner
y. There wasn't any place for them to hide.
The head came through the water again, but slowly t
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) time, and the jaw came to rest on the
ground. The tyrannosaur snorted, flaring its nostri
ls, breathing the air. But the eyes were still
outside the sheet of water.
Tim thought: He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) can't see us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) knows we're in her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>)
e, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) can't see through the water.
The tyrannosaur sniffed.
<div class="bookquote">``What is he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said again.
<div class="bookquote">``Sshhbh.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With a low growl, the jaws slowly opened, and the t
ongue snaked out. It was thick and blue-
black, with a little forked indentation at the tip.
It was four feet long, and easily reached back to
the far wall of the recess. The tongue slid with a
rasping scrape over the filter cylinders. Tim and
Lex pressed back against the pipes.
The tongue moved slowly to the left, then to the ri
ght, slapping wetly against the machinery.
The tip curled around the pipes and valves, sensing
them. Tim saw that the tongue had muscular
movements, like an elephant's trunk, The tongue dre
w back along the right side of the recess. It
dragged against Lex's legs.
<div class="bookquote">``Eeww,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
The tongue stopped. It curled, then began to rise l
ike a snake up the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) body-
<div class="bookquote">``Don't move, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim whispered.
... past her (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) face, then up along Tim's shoulder,
and finally wrapping around his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) head. Tim
squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) eyes shut as the slimy muscle covered
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) face. It was hot and wet and it stunk like
urine.
Wrapped around him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>), the tongue began to drag him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>), v
ery slowly, toward the open laws.
<div class="bookquote">``Timmy ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim couldn't answer; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) mouth was covered by the f
lat black tongue. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could see, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
couldn't talk. Lex tugged at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on, Timmy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The tongue dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) toward the snorting mouth. H
e felt the hot panting breath on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) legs.
Lex was tugging at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was no match for the
muscular power that held him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>). Tim let go of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) and pressed the tongue with both hands, trying
to shove it over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) couldn't move it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) dug his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) heels into the muddy ground but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was d
ragged forward anyway.
Lex had wrapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) arms around his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) waist and was p
ulling backward, shouting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
was powerless to do anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) was beginning to s
ee stars. A kind of peacefulness overcame
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>), a sense of peaceful inevitability as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) was dr
agged along.
Timmy?''
And then suddenly the tongue relaxed, and uncoiled.
Tim felt it slipping off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) face. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) body
was covered in disgusting white foamy slime, and th
e tongue fell limply to the ground. The jaws
slapped shut, biting down on the tongue. Dark blood
gushed out, mixing with the mud. The
nostrils still snorted in ragged breaths.
``What's he (<font color='blue'><b>Timmy</b></font>) doing?'' Lex cried.
And then slowly, very slowly, the head began to sli
de backward, out of the recess, leaving a
long scrape in the mud. And finally it disappeared
entirely, and they could see only the silver
sheet of falling water.
Control
``Okay,'' Arnold said, in the control room. ``The rex
is down.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) pushed back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) chair, and
grinned as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) lit a final cigarette and crumpled th
e pack. That did it: the final step in putting the
park back in order. Now all they had to do was go o
ut and move it.
``Son of a bitch,'' Muldoon said, looking at the moni
tor. ``I got him (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) after all.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) turned to
Gennaro. ``It just took him (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) an hour to feel it.''
Henry Wu frowned at the screen. ``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) could drown
, in that position...''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) won't drown,'' Muldoon said. ``Never seen an anim
al that was harder to kill.''
``I think we have to go out and move him (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>),'' Arnold sa
id, ``We
will,'' Muldoon said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) didn't sound enthusiastic.
``That's a valuable animal.''
``I know it's a valuable animal,'' Muldoon said.
Arnold turned to Gennaro. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) couldn't resist a mome
nt of triumph. ``I'd point out to you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)
said, ``that the park is now completely back to norm
al.. Whatever Malcolm's mathematical model
said was going to happen. We are completely under c
ontrol again.''
Gennaro pointed to the screen behind Arnold's head
and said, ``What's that?''
Arnold turned. It was the system status box, in the
upper corner of the screen. Ordinarily it was
empty. Arnold was surprised to see that it was now
blinking yellow: AUX PWR LOW. For a
moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) didn't understand. Why should auxiliary
power be low? They were running on main
power, not auxiliary power. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) thought perhaps it w
as just a routine status check on the auxiliary
power, perhaps a check on the fuel tank levels or t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) battery charge...
``Henry,'' Arnold said to Wu. ``Look at this.''
Wu said, ``Why are you running on auxiliary power?''
``I'm
not,'' Arnold said. ``It looks like you are.''
``I can't be.''
``Print the system status log,'' Wu said. The log was
a record of the system over the last few
hours.
Arnold pressed a button, and they heard the hum of
a printer in the corner. Wu walked over to it.
Arnold stared at the screen. The box now turned fro
m flashing yellow to red, and the message
now read: AUX PWR FAIL, Numbers began to count back
ward from twenty.
``What the hell is going on?'' Arnold said.
Cautiously, Tim moved a few yards out along the mud
dy path, into the sunshine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) peered
around the waterfall, and saw the tyrannosaur lying
on its side, floating in the pool of water below.
``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'s dead,'' Lex said.
Tim could see he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) wasn't: the dinosaur's chest was s
till moving, and one forearm twitched in
spasms. But something was wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>). Then Tim
saw the white canister sticking in the back
of the head, by the indentation of the ear.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'s been shot with a dart,'' Tim said.
``Good,'' Lex said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) practically ate us.''
Tim watched the labored breathing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) felt unexpect
edly distressed to see the huge animal
humbled like this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) didn't want it to die. ``It's
not his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) fault,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said.
``Oh sure,'' Lex said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) practically ate us and it'
s not his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) fault.''
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'s a carnivore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was just doing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, ``if you were in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stomach right now.
Then the sound of the waterfall changed. From a dea
fening roar, it became softer, quieter. The
thundering sheet of water thinned, became a trickle
...
And stopped.
``Timmy. The waterfall stopped,'' Lex said.
It was now just dripping like a tap that wasn't com
pletely turned off. The pool at the base of the
waterfall was still. They stood near the top, in th
e cave-like indentation filled with machinery,
looking down.
``Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop,'' Lex said.
Tim shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) head. ``It must be the power... . So
mebody turned off the power.'' Behind them,
all the pumps and filters were shutting down one af
ter another, the lights blinking off, and the
machinery becoming quiet.
And then there was the thunk of a solenoid releasin
g, and the door marked MAINT 04 swung
slowly open.
Grant stepped out, blinking in the light, and said,
``Good work, kids. You got the door open.''
``We didn't do anything,'' Lex said. ``The

<p/>power went out,'' Tim said.
``Never mind that,'' Grant said. ``Come and see what I
've found.''
Arnold stared in shock.
One after another, the monitors went black, and the
n the room lights went out, plunging the
control room into darkness and confusion. Everyone
started yelling at once. Muldoon opened the
blinds and let light in, and Wu brought over the pr
intout.
``Look at this,'' Wu said.

Wu said, ``You shut down at five-thbirteen this morn
ing, and when you started back up, you
started with auxiliary power.''
``Jesus,'' Arnold said. Apparently, main power had no
t been on since shutdown. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)
powered back up, only the auxiliary power came on.
Arnold was thinking that was strange, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) suddenly realized that that was normal. That was
what was supposed to happen. It made
perfect sense: the auxiliary generator fired up fir
st, and it was used to turn on the main generator,
because it took a heavy charge to start the main po
wer generator. That was the way the system
was designed.
But Arnold had never before had occasion to turn th
e main power off. And when the lights and
screens came back on in the control room, it never
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) that main power hadn't also
been restored.
But it hadn't, and all during the time since then,
while they were looking for the rex, and doing
one thing and another, the park had been running on
auxilary power. And that wasn't a good
idea. In fact, the implications were just beginning
to hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)-
``What does this line mean?'' Muldoon said, pointing
to the list.
05:14:57
Warning: Fence Status -LSB-NB-RSB-
Operative - Aux Power
-LSB--AV09-RSB-
``It means a system status warning was sent to the m
onitors in the control room,'' Arnold said.
``Concerning the fences.''
``Did you see that warning?''
Arnold shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) head, ``No. I must have been talkin
g to you in the field. Anyway, no, I didn't
see it.''
``What does it mean, `Warning: Fence Status'?''
``Well, I didn't know it at the time, but we were ru
nning on backup power,'' Arnold said. ``And
backup doesn't generate enough amperage to power th
e electrified fences, so they were
automatically kept off.''
Muldoon scowled. <div class="bookquote">``The electrified fences were off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All of them? Since five this morning? For the last

d a scream. Muldoon began to talk very

<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Arnold is going to the maintenance shed to tur

<div class="bookquote">``Fine. Then go with the others to the lodge.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Muldo

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) went through the door, and hurried down the hall
toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) office. Gennaro fell into step
alongside him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Change your mind?''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon growled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll need help,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``I might.''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon went into the room marked ANIMAL
SUPERVISOR, picked up the gray
shoulder launcher, and unlocked a panel in the wall
behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) desk. There were six cylinders
and six canisters.
<div class="bookquote">``The thing about these damn dinos,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said, <div class="bookquote">''
is that they have distributed nervous

s one after another and dropping in the
canisters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) tossed a thick webbed belt to Gennaro
. <div class="bookquote">``Put that on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro tightened the belt, and Muldoon passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>)
the shells. <div class="bookquote">``About all we can hope to do
is blow them apart. Unfortunately we've only got si
x shells here. There's eight raptors in that
fenced compound. Let's go. Stay close. You have the
shells.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon went out and ran along the hallway, looking
down over the balcony to the path
leading toward the maintenance shed. Gennaro was pu
ffing alongside him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>). They got to the
ground floor and went out through the glass doors,
and Muldoon stopped.
Arnold was standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) back to the maintenanc
e shed. Three raptors approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>).
Arnold had picked up a stick, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) was waving it
at them, shouting. The raptors fanned out as
they came closer, one staying in the center, the ot
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) two moving to each side. Coordinated.
Smooth. Gennaro shivered.
Pack behavior.
Muldoon was already crouching, setting the launcher
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Load,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said.
Gennaro slipped the shell in the back of the launch
er. There was an electric sizzle. Nothing
happened. <div class="bookquote">``Christ, you've got it in backward,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Muld
oon said, tilting the barrel so the shell fell into

<p/>Gennaro's hands. Gennaro loaded again. The raptors
were snarling at Arnold when the animal
on the left simply exploded, the upper part of the
torso flying into the air, blood spattering like a
burst tomato on the walls of the building. The lowe
r torso collapsed on the ground, the legs
kicking in the air, the tail flopping.
<div class="bookquote">``That'll wake 'em up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
Arnold ran for the door of the maintenance shed. Th
e velociraptors turned, and started toward
Muldoon and Gennaro. They fanned out as they came c
loser. In the distance, somewhere near
the lodge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) heard screams.
Gennaro said, <div class="bookquote">``This could be a disaster.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Load,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>M
uldoon said.
Henry Wu heard the explosions and looked toward the
door of the control room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) circled
around the consoles, then paused. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) wanted to go o
ut, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) should stay in the room.
If Arnold was able to get the power back on-if only
for a minute-then Wu could restart the main
generator.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) had to stay in the room.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) heard someone screaming. It sounded like Muldoon
.
Muldoon felt a wrenching pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) ankle, tumbled
down an embankment, and hit the ground
running. Looking back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) saw Gennaro running in th
e other direction, into the forest. The raptors
were ignoring Gennaro but pursuing Muldoon. They we
re now less than twenty yards away.
Muldoon screamed at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) lungs as he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) ran,
wondering vaguely where the hell he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) could
go. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) had perhaps ten seconds befo
re they got him (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>).
Ten seconds. Maybe

<p/>less.
Ellie had to help Malcolm turn over as Harding jabb
ed the needle and injected morphine. Malcolm
sighed and collapsed back. It seemed be was growing
weaker by the minute. Over the radio, they
heard tinny screaming, and muffled explosions comin
g from the visitor center.

<div class="bookquote">``I will tell you what I am talking about,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) said.
``Most kinds of power require a substantial
sacrifice by whoever wants the power. There is an a
pprenticeship, a discipline lasting many
years. Whatever kind of power you want. President o
f the company. Black belt in karate. Spiritual
guru. Whatever it is you seek, you have to put in t
he (<font color='blue'><b>guru</b></font>) time, the practice, the effort. You must give
up a lot to get it. It has to be very important to
you. And once you have attained it, it is your
power. It can't be given away: it resides in you. I
t is literally the result of your discipline.
``Now, what is interesting about this process is tha
t, by the time someone has acquired the
ability to kill with his (<font color='blue'><b>guru</b></font>) bare hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>guru</b></font>) has also ma
tured to the point where he (<font color='blue'><b>guru</b></font>) won't use it unwisely.
So that kind of power has a built-in control. The d
iscipline of getting the power changes you so
that you won't abuse it.
``But scientific power is like inherited wealth: att
ained without discipline. You read what others
have done, and you take the next step. You can do i
t very young. You can make progress very
fast. There is no discipline lasting many decades.
There is no mastery: old scientists are ignored.
There is no humility before nature. There is only a
get-rich-quick, make-a-name-for-yourself-fast
philosophy. Cheat, lie, falsify-it doesn't matter.
Not to you, or to your colleagues. No one will
criticize you. No one has any standards. They are a
ll trying to do the same thing: to do something
big, and do it fast.
``And because you can stand on the shoulders of gian
ts, you can accomplish something
quickly. You don't even know exactly what you have
done, but already you have reported it,
patented it, and sold it. And the buyer will have e
ven less discipline than you. The buyer simply
purchases the power, like any commodity. The buyer
doesn't even conceive that any discipline
might be necessary.''
Hammond said, ``Do you know what he (<font color='blue'><b>buyer</b></font>) is talking about
?'' Ellie
nodded.
``I haven't a clue,'' Hammond said.
``I'll make it simple,'' Malcolm said. ``A karate mast
er does not kill people with his (<font color='blue'><b>buyer</b></font>) bare hands.
He (<font color='blue'><b>buyer</b></font>) does not lose his (<font color='blue'><b>buyer</b></font>) temper and kill his (<font color='blue'><b>buyer</b></font>) wife. The
person who kills is the person who has no
discipline, no restraint, and who has purchased his (<font color='blue'><b>buyer</b></font>)
power in the form of a Saturday night special.
And that is the kind of power that science fosters,
and permits. And that is why you think that to
build a place like this is simple.''
``It was simple,'' Hammond insisted.
``Then why did it go wrong?''
Dizzy with tension, John Arnold threw open the door
to the maintenance shed and stepped into
the darkness inside. Jesus, it was black. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) should
have realized the lights would be out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) felt
the cool air, the cavernous dimensions of the space
, extending two floors below him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) had to
find the catwalk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) had to be careful, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)'d bre
ak his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) neck.
The catwalk.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) groped like a blind man until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) realized it was
futile. Somehow he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) had to get light into the
shed, He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) went back to the door and cracked it open
four inches. That gave enough light. But
there was no way to keep the door open. Quickly he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)
kicked off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) shoe and stuck it in the door.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) went toward the catwalk, seeing it easily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) wa
lked along the corrugated metal, hearing
the difference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) feet, one loud, one soft. But
at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) could see. Up ahead was the
stairway leading down to the generators. Another te
n yards.
Darkness.
The light was gone.
Arnold looked back to the door, and saw the light w
as blocked by the body of a velociraptor.
The animal bent over, and carefully sniffed the sho
e.
Henry Wu paced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) hands over the computer
consoles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) touched the screens. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>)
was in constant movement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) was almost frantic wit
b tension.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) reviewed the steps he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) would take. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) must be qui
ck. The first screen would come up, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) would press-
``Wu!'' The radio hissed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) grabbed for it. ``Yes. I'm here.''
``Got any bloody power yet?'' It was Muldoon. There w
as something odd about his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) voice,
something hollow.
``No,'' Wu said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) smiled, glad to know Muldoon was
alive.
``I think Arnold made it to the shed,'' Muldoon said-
``After that, I don't know.''
``Where are you?'' Wu said.
``I'm stuffed.''
``What?''
``Stuffed in a bloody pipe,'' Muldoon said. ``And I'm
very popular at the moment.''
Wedged in a pipe was more like it, Muldoon thought.
There had been a stack of drainage pipes
piled behind the visitor center, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>)'d backed hi
mself into the nearest one, scrambling like a
poor bastard. Meter pipes, very tight fit for him (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>),
but they couldn't come in after him (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>).
At least, not after he (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>)'d shot the leg off one, when
the nosy bastard came too close to the pipe.
The raptor had gone howling off, and the others wer
e now respectful. His (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) only regret was that he (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>)
hadn't waited to see the snout at the end of the tu
be before he (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>)'d squeezed the trigger.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) might still have his (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) chance, because there w
ere three or four outside, snarling and
growling around him (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>).
``Yes, very popular,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) said into the radio.
Wu said, ``Does Arnold have a radio?''
``Don't think so,'' Muldoon said. ``Just sit tight. Wa
it it out.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) hadn't seen what the other end of the pipe was l
ike-he'd backed in too quickly-and he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>)
couldn't see now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) was wedged tight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) could onl
y hope that the far end wasn't open. Christ,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) didn't like the thought of one of those bastards
taking a bite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) hindquarters.
Arnold backed away down the catwalk. The velocirapt
or was barely ten feet away, stalking him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>),
coming forward into the gloom. Arnold could hear th
e click of its deadly claws on the metal.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) was going slowly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) knew the animal could s
ee well, but the grille of the catwalk, the
unfamiliar mechanical odors had made it cautious. T
hat caution was his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) only chance, Arnold
thought. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) could get to the stairs, and then mo
ve down to the floor below ...
Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) was pretty sure velociraptors couldn't c
limb stairs. Certainly not narrow, steep
stairs.
Arnold glanced over his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) shoulder. The stairs were j
ust a few feet away. Another few steps ...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) was there! Reaching back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) felt the railing, s
tarted scrambling down the almost vertical
steps. His (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) feet touched flat concrete. The raptor s
narled in frustration, twenty feet above him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) on
the catwalk.
<div class="bookquote">``Too bad, buddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Arnold said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) turned away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) w
as now very close to the auxiliary
generator. Just a few more steps and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) would see i
t, even in this dim light... .
There was a dull thump behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>). Arnold

<p/>turned.
The raptor was standing there on the concrete floor
, snarling. It
had jumped down.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) looked quickly for a weapon, but suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) fou
nd he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) was slammed onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) back on the
concrete. Something heavy was pressing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) chest
, it was impossible to breathe, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)
realized the animal was standing on top of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) felt the big claws digging into the flesh of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) chest, and smelled the foul breath from the hea
d moving above him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)
mouth to scream.
Ellie held the radio in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) hands, listening. Two m
ore Tican workmen had arrived at the lodge;
they seemed to know it was safe here. But there had
been no others in the last few Minutes. And
it sounded quieter outside. Over the radio, Muldoon
said, <div class="bookquote">``How long has it been?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Wu said, <div class="bookquote">``Four, five minutes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Arnold should have done it by now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
<div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)'s going to. You got any ideas?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said.
<div class="bookquote">``We heard from Gennaro?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro pressed the button. <div class="bookquote">``I'm here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where the hell are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm going to the maintenance building,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro sa
id. <div class="bookquote">``Wish me luck.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro crouched in the foliage, listening.
Directly ahead he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) saw the planted pathway, leading
toward the visitor center. Gennaro knew
the maintenance shed was somewhere to the east. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
heard the chirping of birds in the trees. A
soft mist was blowing. One of the raptors roared, b
ut it was some distance away. It sounded off to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) right. Gennaro set out, leaving the path, plung
ing into the foliage.
Like to live dangerously? Not

<p/>really.
It was true, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) didn't. But Gennaro thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) had
a plan, or at least a possibility that might
work. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) stayed north of the main complex of bui
ldings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) could approach the maintenance
shed from the rear. All the raptors were probably a
round the other buildings, to the south. There
was no reason for them to be in the jungle.
At least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) hoped not.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) moved as quietly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) could, unhappily aware he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
was making a lot of noise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) forced
himself to slow his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) pace, feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) heart pound.
The foliage here was very dense; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) couldn't
see more than six or seven feet ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) be
gan to worry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)'d miss the maintenance
shed entirely. But then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) saw the roof to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) righ
t, above the palms.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) moved toward it, went around the side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) found
the door, opened it, and slipped inside. It
was very dark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) stumbled over something.
A man's shoe.
Gennaro frowned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) propped the door wide open and
continued deeper into the building. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
saw a catwalk directly ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>). Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) re
alized he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) didn't know where to go. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) radio behind.
Damn!
There might be a radio somewhere in the maintenance
building. Or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)'d just look for the
generator. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) knew what a generator looked like. Pr
obably it was somewhere down on the lower
floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) found a staircase leading down.
It was darker below, and it was difficult to see an
ything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) way along among the pipes,
holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) bands out to keep from banging his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) head
.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) heard an animal snarl, and froze. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) listened, b
ut the sound did not come again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) moved
forward cautiously. Something dripped on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) should
er, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) bare arm. It was warm, like water.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) touched it in the darkness.
Sticky. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) smelled it. Blood.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) looked up. The raptor was perched on pipes, just
a few feet above his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) head. Blood was
trickling from its claws. With an odd sense of deta
chment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) wondered if it was injured. And then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) began to run, but the raptor jumped onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) bac
k, pushing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) to the ground.
Gennaro was strong; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) heaved up, knocking the rapt
or away, and rolled off across the
concrete. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) turned back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) saw that the rapt
or had fallen on its side, where it lay panting.
Yes, it was injured. Its leg was hurt, for some rea
son.
Kill it
Gennaro scrambled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) feet, looking for a weapon
. The raptor was still panting on the
concrete. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) looked frantically for sometbing-anyth
ing-to use as a weapon. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) turned
back, the raptor was gone.
It snarled, the sound echoing in the darkness.
Gennaro turned in a full circle, feeling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) o
utstretched hands. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) felt a sharp
pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) right hand.
Teeth.
It was biting him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>).
The raptor jerked his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) head, and Donald Gennaro was
yanked off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) feet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) fell.
Lying in bed, soaked in sweat, Malcolm listened as
the radio crackled. <div class="bookquote">``Anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The radio clicked off. Malcolm closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) eyes, and
breathed slowly, marshaling his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) strength.
<div class="bookquote">``Just relax,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said. <div class="bookquote">``Just take it easy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know what we are really talking about here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>M
alcolm said. ``All this attempt to control ...
We are talking about Western attitudes that are fiv
e hundred years old. They began at the time
when Florence, Italy, was the most important city i
n the world. The basic idea of science-that
there was a new way to look at reality, that it was
objective, that it did not depend on your beliefs
or your nationality, that it was rational-that idea
was fresh and exciting back then. It offered
promise and hope for the future, and it swept away
the old medieval system, which was hundreds
of years old. The medieval world of feudal politics
and religious dogma and hateful superstitions
fell before science. But, in truth, this was becaus
e the medieval world didn't really work any more.
It didn't work economically, it didn't work intelle
ctually, and it didn't fit the new world that was
emerging.
Malcolm coughed.
``But now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) continued, ``science is the belief sys
tem that is hundreds of years old. And, like
the medieval system before it, science is starting
not to fit the world any more. Science has
attained so much power that its practical limits be
gin to be apparent. Largely through science,
billions of us live in one small world, densely pac
ked and intercommunicating. But science cannot
help us decide what to do with that world, or how t
o live. Science can make a nuclear reactor, but
it cannot tell us not to build it. Science can make
pesticide, but cannot tell us not to use it. And
our world starts to seem polluted in fundamental wa
ys-air, and water, and land-because of
ungovernable science.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) sighed. ``This much is obv
ious to everyone.''
There was a silence. Malcolm lay with his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) eyes clos
ed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) breathing labored. No one spoke,
and it seemed to Ellie that Malcolm had finally fal
len asleep. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) sat up again, abruptly.
``At the same time, the great intellectual justifica
tion of science has vanished. Ever since
Newton and Descartes, science has explicitly offere
d us the vision of total control. Science has
claimed the power to eventually control everything,
through its understanding of natural laws. But
in the twentieth century, that claim has been shatt
ered beyond repair. First, Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle set limits on what we could k
now about the subatomic world. Oh well, we
say. None of us lives in a subatomic world. It does
n't make any practical difference as we go
through our lives. Then G``del's theorem set similar
limits to mathematics, the formal language of
science. Mathematicians used to think that their la
nguage had some special inherent trueness
that derived from the laws of logic. Now we know th
at what we call `reason' is just an arbitrary
game. It's not special, in the way we thought it wa
s.
``And now chaos theory proves that unpredictability
is built into our daily lives. It is as mundane
as the rainstorm we cannot predict. And so the gran
d vision of science, hundreds of years old-the
dream of total control-has died, in our century. An
d with it much of the justification, the rationale
for science to do what it does. And for us to liste
n to it. Science has always said that it may not
know everything now but it will know, eventually. B
ut now we see that isn't true. It is an idle boast.

<p/>As foolish, and as misguided, as the child who jump
s off a building because he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) believes he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) can
fly.''
``This is very extreme,'' Hammond said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) h
ead.
``We are witnessing the end of the scientific era. S
cience, like other outmoded systems, is
destroying itself. As it gains in power, it proves
itself incapable of handling the power. Because
things are going very fast now. Fifty years ago, ev
eryone was gaga over the atomic bomb. That
was power. No one could imagine anything more. Yet,
a bare decade after the bomb, we began
to have genetic power. And genetic power is far mor
e potent than atomic power. And it will be in
everyone's hands. It will be in kits for backyard g
ardeners. Experiments for schoolchildren. Cheap
labs for terrorists and dictators, And that will fo
rce everyone to ask the same question-What
should I do with my power?-which is the very questi
on science says it cannot answer.''
``So what will happen?'' Ellie said.
Malcolm shrugged. ``A change.''
``What kind of change?''
``All major changes are like death,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) said. ``You c
an't see to the other side until you are there.''
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) eyes.
``The poor man,'' Hammond said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) head.
Malcolm sighed. ``Do you have any idea,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``h

Its electric motor whirring, the cart raced forward
down the dark underground tunnel. Grant drove,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) foot to the floor. The tunnel was featureless e

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because this one is young,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``And becau
se it's a boy dinosaur.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is
it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, peering along the flashlight beam.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes. Now shine that light forward, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) h
eld out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) wrist turning the watch to her (<font color='blue'><b>Its</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``What does it say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It says ... ten-fifteen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said, <div class="bookquote">``That means we have only forty-five minut
es to contact the boat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We should be close,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``I figure we shou
ld be almost to the visitor center right now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) wasn't sure, but be sensed the tunnel was gently
tilting upward, leading them back to the
surface, and-
<div class="bookquote">``Wow!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
They burst out into daylight with shocking speed. T
here was a light mist blowing, partially
obscuring the building that loomed directly above t
hem. Grant saw at once that it was the visitor
center. They had arrived right in front of the gara
ge!
<div class="bookquote">``Yay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex shouted. <div class="bookquote">``We did it! Yay!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Its</b></font>) bounced u
p and down in the seat as Grant parked
the cart in the garage. Along one wall were stac an
imal cages. They put the velociraptor in one,
with a dish of water. Then they started climbing th
e stairs to the ground-floor entrance of the
visitor center.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm going to get a hamburger! And french fries! Ch
ocolate milk shake! No more dinosaurs!
Yay!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They came to the lobby, and they opened the d
oor.
And they fell silent.
In the lobby of the visitor center, the glass doors
had been shattered, and a cold gray mist blew
through the cavernous main hall. A sign that read W
HEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH
dangled from one hinge, creaking in the wind. The b
ig tyrannosaur robot was upended and lay
with its legs in the air, its tubing and metal inna
rds exposed. Outside, through the glass, they saw
rows of palm trees, shadowy shapes in the fog.
Tim and Lex huddled against the metal desk of the s
ecurity guard. Grant took the guard's radio
and tried all the channels. <div class="bookquote">``Hello, this is Grant.
Is anybody there? Hello, this is Grant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex stared at the body of the guard, lying on the f
loor to the right. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) couldn't see anything but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) legs and feet.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello, this is Grant. Hello.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex was leaning forward, peering around the edge of
the desk. Grant grabbed her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) sleeve.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey. Stop that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) dead? What's that stuff on the floor? Blood?
''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How come it isn't real red?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``You're

<p/>morbid,'' Tim said.
``What's `morbid'? I am not.''
The radio crackled. ``My God,'' came a voice. ``Grant?
Is that you?''
And then: ``Alan? Alan?'' It was Ellie. ``I'm here,'' G
rant said.
``Thank God,'' Ellie said. ``Are you all right?''
``I'm all right, yes.''
``What about the kids? Have you seen them?''
``I have the kids with me,'' Grant said. ``They're oka
y.''
``Thank God.''
Lex was crawling around the side of the desk. Grant
slapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) ankle. ``Get back here.<div class="bookquote">''
The radio crackled. '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-n where are you?''
``In the lobby. In the lobby of the main building.''
Over the radio, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heard Wu say, ``My God. They're h
ere.''
``Alan, listen,'' Ellie said. ``The raptors have gotte
n loose. They can open doors. They may be in
the same building as you.''
``Great. Where are you?'' Grant said. ``We're in the l
odge.''
Grant said, ``And the others? Muldoon, everybody els
e?''
``We've lost a few people. But we got everybody else
over to the lodge.''
``And are the telephones working?''
``No. The whole system is shut off. Nothing works.<div class="bookquote">''
`How do we get the system back on?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We've been trying.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We have to get it back on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said, <div class="bookquote">``right awa
y. If we don't, within half an hour the raptors
will reach the mainland.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) started to explain about the boat when Muldoon c
ut him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) off. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think you understand,
Dr. Grant. We haven't got half an hour left, over h

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How's that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Some of the raptors followed us. We've got two on

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So what? The building's impregnable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon coughed, <div class="bookquote">``Apparently not. It was never expe

roof.''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>The radio crackled. <div class="bookquote">''-must have planted a tr

 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said, <div class="bookquote">``Biting through the bars?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) frowned,
trying to imagine it, <div class="bookquote">``How fast?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said, <div class="bookquote">``they have a bite pressure of

<div class="bookquote">``How fast?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said again.
Muldoon said, <div class="bookquote">``I'd guess we've got another ten, fif
teen minutes before they break through
completely and come through the skylight into the b
uilding. And once they're in ... Ah, just a
minute, Dr. Grant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>The radio clicked off.
In the skylight above Malcolm's bed, the raptors ha
d chewed through the first of the steel bars.
One raptor gripped the end of the bar and tugged, p
ulling it back. It put its powerful hind limb on
the skylight and the glass shattered, glittering do
wn on Malcolm's bed below. Ellie reached over
and removed the largest fragments from the sheets.
<div class="bookquote">``God, they're ugly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said, looking up.
Now that the glass was broken, they could hear the
snorts and snarls of the raptors, the squeal
of their teeth on the metal as they chewed the bars
. There were silver thinned sections where
they had chewed. Foamy saliva spattered onto the sh
eets, and the bedside table.
<div class="bookquote">``At least they can't get in yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said. <div class="bookquote">``Not
until they chew through another bar.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said, <div class="bookquote">``If Grant could somehow get to the mainten
ance shed ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bloody hell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) limped around the r
oom on his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) sprained ankle. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) can't get
there fast enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) can't get the power on fast e

 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm coughed. <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) voice was soft, almost
a wheeze.
<div class="bookquote">``What'd he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Can ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Distraction ...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) winced.
<div class="bookquote">``What kind of a distraction?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go to the fence...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Yes?

<p/>And do what?''
Malcolm grinned weakly. ``Stick ... your hands thr
ough.'' ``Oh
Christ,'' Muldoon said, turning away.
``Wait a minute,'' Wu said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)'s right. There are on
ly two raptors here. Which means there are
at least four more out there. We could go out and p
rovide a distraction.''
``And then what?''
``And then Grant would be free to go to the maintena
nce building and turn on the generator.''
``And then go back to the control room and start up
the system?''
``Exactly.''
``No time,'' Muldoon said. ``No time.''
``But if we can lure the raptors down here,'' Wu said
, ``maybe even get them away from that
skylight. It might work. Worth a try.''
``Bait,'' Muldoon said.
``Exactly.''
``Who's going to be the bait? I'm no good. My ankle'
s shot.'' ``I'll
do it,'' Wu said.
``No,'' Muldoon said. ``You're the only one who knows
what to do about the computer. You need
to talk Grant through the start-up.''
``Then I'll do it,'' Harding said.
``No,'' Ellie said. ``Malcolm needs you. I'll do it.''
``Hell, I don't think so,'' Muldoon said. ``You'd have
raptors all around you, raptors on the roof...
.''
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was already bending over, lacing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) runnin
g shoes. ``Just don't tell Grant,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said.
``It'll make him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) nervous.''
The lobby was quiet, chilly fog drifting past them.
The radio had been silent for several minutes.
Tim said, ``Why aren't they talking to us?''
``I'm hungry,'' Lex said.
``They're trying to plan,'' Grant said.
The radio crackled. ``Grant, are you-nry Wu speaking
. Are you there?'' ``I'm
here,'' Grant said.
``Listen,'' Wu said. ``Can you see to the rear of the
visitor building from where you are?''
Grant looked through the rear glass doors, to the p
alm trees and the fog. ``Yes,'' Grant
said.
Wu said, ``There's a path straight through the palm
trees to the maintenance building. That's
where the power equipment and generators are. I bel
ieve you saw the maintenance building
yesterday?''
``Yes,'' Grant said. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was momentarily puzzle
d. Was it yesterday that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had looked
into the building? It seemed like years ago.
``Now, listen,'' Wu said. ``We think we can get all th
e raptors down here by the lodge, but we
aren't sure. So be careful. Give us five minutes.''
``Okay,'' Grant said.
``You can leave the kids in the cafeteria, and they
should be all right. Take the radio with you
when you go.''
``Okay.''
``Turn it off before you leave, so it doesn't make a
ny noise outside. And call me when you get to
the maintenance building.''
``Okay.''
Grant turned the radio off. Lex crawled back. ``Are
we going to the cafeteria?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) said.
``Yes,'' Grant said. They got up, and started walking
through the blowing mist in the lobby. ``I
want a hamburger,'' Lex said.
``I don't think there's any electricity to cook with
.''
``Then ice cream.''
``Tim, you'll have to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and help her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''
``I will.''
``I've got to leave for a while,'' Grant said.
``I know.''
They moved to the cafeteria entrance. On opening th
e door, Grant saw square dining-room
tables and chairs, swinging stainless-steel doors b
eyond. Nearby, a cash register and a rack with
gum and candy.
``Okay, kids. I want you to stay here no matter what
. Got it?''
``Leave us the radio,'' Lex said.
``I can't. I need it. Just stay here. I'll only be g
one about five minutes. Okay?''
``Okay.''
Grant closed the door. The cafeteria became complet
ely dark. Lex clutched his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) hand, ``Turn on
the lights,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) said.
``I can't,'' Tim said. ``There's no electricity.'' But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) pulled down his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) night-vistion goggles.
``That's fine for you. What about me?''
``Just hold my hand. We'll get some food.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) led he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
r forward. In phosphorescent green he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw
the tables and chairs. To the right, the glowing gr
een cash register, and the rack with gum and
candy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) grabbed a handful of candy bars.
``I told you,'' Lex said. ``I want ice cream, not cand
y.''
``Take these anyway.''
``Ice cream, Tim.''
``Okay, okay.''
Tim stuffed the candy bars in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) pocket, and led L
ex deeper into the dining room. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) tugged
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) band. ``I can't see spit,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) said.
``Just walk with me. Hold my hand.''
``Then slow down.''
Beyond the tables and chairs was a pair of swinging
doors with little round windows in them.
They probably led to the kitchen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) pushed one doo
r open and it held wide.
Ellie Sattler stepped outside the front door to the
lodge, and felt the chilly mist on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) face and
legs. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) heart was thumping, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) knew
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) was completely safe behind the
fence. Directly ahead, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) saw the heavy bars in th
e fog.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) couldn't see much beyond the fence. Another
twenty yards before the landscape
turned milky white. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) didn't see any raptors
at all. In fact, the gardens and trees were
almost eerily silent. ``Hey!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) shouted into the f
og, tentatively.
Muldoon leaned against the door frame. ``I doubt tha
t'll do it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said. ``You've got to make a
noise. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) hobbled out carrying a steel rod from t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) construction inside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) banged the rod
against the bars like a dinner gong. ``Come and get
it! Dinner is served!''
``Very amusing,'' Ellie said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) glanced nervously t
oward the roof. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) saw no raptors.
``They don't understand English.<div class="bookquote">'' Muldoon grinned. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But I imagine they get the general idea...
.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was still nervous, and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) humor annoying
. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) looked toward the visitor building,
cloaked in the fog. Muldoon resumed banging on the
bars. At the limit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) vision, almost lost in
the fog, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) saw a ghostly pale animal. A raptor.
``First customer,'' Muldoon said.
The raptor disappeared, a white shadow and then cam
e back, but it did not approach any
closer, and it seemed strangely incurious about the
noise coming from the lodge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was
starting to worry. Unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) could attract the rap
tors to the lodge, Grant would be in danger.
<div class="bookquote">``You're making too much noise,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Ellie said.

<p/>`Bloody hell,'' Muldoon said.
``Well, you are.''
``I know these animals-''
``You're drunk,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said. ``Let me handle it.''
``And how will you do that?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) didn't answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) went to the gate. ``They
say the raptors are intelligent.''
``They are. At least as intelligent as chimps.''
``They have good hearing?''
``Yes, excellent.''
``Maybe they'll know this sound,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said, and open
ed the gate. The metal hinges, rusted from
the constant mist, creaked loudly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) closed it ag
ain, opened it with another creak.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) left it open.
``I wouldn't do that,'' Muldoon said. ``You're going t
o do that, let me get the launcher.''
``Get the launcher.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) sighed, remembering. ``Gennaro has the shells.''
``Well, then,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said. ``Keep an eye out.'' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
went through the gate, stepping outside the
bars. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) heart was pounding so hard she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) could bare
ly feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) feet on the dirt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) moved away
from the fence, and it disappeared frighteningly fa
st in the fog. Soon it was lost behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>).
Just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) expected, Muldoon began shouting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
in drunken agitation. ``God damn it, girl,
don't you do that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) bellowed.
``Don't call me `girl,''' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) shouted back.
``I'll call you any damn thing I want,'' Muldoon shou
ted.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) wasn't listening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was turning slowly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) b
ody tense, watching from all sides. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was
at least twenty yards from the fence now, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) c
ould see the mist drifting like a light rain past
the foliage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) stayed away from the foliage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
moved through a world of shades of gray. The
muscles in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) legs and shoulders ached from the te
nsion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) eyes strained to see.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you hear me, damn it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Muldoon bellowed.
How good are these animals? she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) wondered. Good enou
gh to cut off my retreat? There wasn't
much distance back to the fence, not really-
They attacked.
There was no sound.
The first animal charged from the foliage at the ba
se of a tree to the left. It sprang forward and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) turned to run. The second attacked from the oth
er side, clearly intending to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
ran, and it leapt into the air, claws raised to att
ack, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) darted like a broken field runner, and

<p/>the animal crashed down in the dirt. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was ru
nning flat out, not daring to look back, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
breaths coming in deep gasps, seeing the bars of th
e fence emerge from the haze, seeing
Muldoon throw the gate wide, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) reaching fo
r her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>), shouting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>), grabbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) arm and
pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) through so hard she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was yanked off her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
feet and fell to the ground. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) turned in
time to see first one, then two-then tbree-animals
hit the fence and snarl.
<div class="bookquote">``Good work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon shouted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) was taunting the a
nimals now, snarling back, and it drove
them wild. They flung themselves at the fence, leap
ing forward, and one of them nearly made it
over the top. <div class="bookquote">``Christ, that was close! These bastar
ds can jump!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) got to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) feet, looking at the scrapes and bru
ises, the blood running down her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) leg. All she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
could think was: three animals here. And two on the
roof. That meant one was still missing,
somewhere.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on, help me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``Let's keep 'em i
nterested!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant left the visitor center and moved quickly for
ward, into the mist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) found the path among
the palm trees and followed it north. Up ahead, the
rectangular maintenance shed emerged from
the fog.
There was no door that he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) could see at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) walk
ed on, around the corner. At the back,
screened by planting, Grant saw a concrete loading
dock for trucks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) scrambled up to face a
vertical rolling door of corrugated steel; it was l
ocked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) jumped down again and continued
around the building. Farther ahead, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) right, G
rant saw an ordinary door. It was propped open
with a man's shoe.
Grant stepped inside and squinted in the darkness.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) listened, heard nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) picked up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) radio and turned it on.
<div class="bookquote">``This is Grant,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm inside.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu looked up at the skylight. The two raptors still
peered down into Malcolm's room, but they
seemed distracted by the noises outside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) went to
the lodge window. Outside, the three
velociraptors continued to charge the fence. Ellie
was running back and forth, safely behind the
bars. But the raptors no longer seemed to be seriou
sly trying to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>). Now they almost seemed
to be playing, circling back from the fence, rearin
g up and snarling, then dropping down low, to
circle again and finally charge. Their behavior had
taken on the distinct quality of display, rather
than serious attack.
<div class="bookquote">``Like birds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``Putting on a show.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu nodded. <div class="bookquote">``They're intelligent. They see they can'
t get her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). They're not really trying.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The radio crackled. <div class="bookquote">''-side.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu gripped the radio. <div class="bookquote">``Say again, Dr. Grant?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``I'm

<p/>inside,'' Grant said.
``Dr. Grant, you're in the maintenance building?''
``Yes,'' Grant said. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) added, ``Maybe you should
call me Alan.''
``All right, Alan. If you're standing just inside th
e cast door, you see a lot of pipes and tubing.''
Wu closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) eyes, visualizing it, ``Straight ahead
is a big recessed well in the center of the
building that goes two stories underground. To your
left is a metal walkway with railings.''
``I see it.''
``Go along the walkway.''
``I'm going.'' Faintly, the radio carried the clang o
f his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) footsteps on metal.
``After you go twenty or thirty feet, you'll see ano
ther walkway going right.'' ``I
see it,'' Grant said.
``Follow that walkway.''
``Okay.''
``As you continue,'' Wu said, ``you will come to a lad
der on your left. Going down into the pit.''
``I see it.''
``Go down the ladder.''
There was a long pause. Wu ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) fingers through
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) damp hair, Muldoon frowned tensely.
``Okay, I'm down the ladder,'' Grant said.
``Good,'' Wu said. ``Now, straight ahead of you should
be two large yellow tanks that are
marked `Flammable.' ''
``They say `In-flammable.' And then something undern
eath. In Spanish.''
``Those are the ones,'' Wu said. ``Those are the two f
uel tanks for the generator. One of them
has been run dry, and so we have to switch over to
the other. If you look at the bottom of the
tanks, you'll see a white pipe coming out.''
``Four-inch PVC?''
``Yes. PVC. Follow that pipe as it goes back.''
``Okay. I'm following it... Ow!''
``What happened?''
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing. I hit my head.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There

<p/>was a pause.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you all right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, fine. Just ... hurt my head. Stupid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Keep following the pipe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay, okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sounded irritable. <div class="bookquote">``Ok
ay. The pipe goes to a big aluminum box
with air vents in the sides. Says `Honda.' It looks
like the generator.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said. <div class="bookquote">``That's the generator. If you walk

two buttons.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I see them. Yellow and red?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said. <div class="bookquote">``Press the yellow one firs
t, and while you hold it down, press the red
one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was another pause. It lasted almost a minute.
Wu and Muldoon looked at each other.
<div class="bookquote">``Alan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It didn't work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you hold down the yellow first and then press
the red?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) sounded annoyed. <div class="bookquote">``I di
d exactly what you told me to do. There was
a hum, and then a click, click, click, very fast, a
nd then the hum stopped, and nothing after that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Try it again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I already did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``It didn't work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay, just a minute.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu frowned. <div class="bookquote">``It sounds like

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go around to the back of the generator, to where t

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A pause; then Grant said, <div class="bookquote">``The pipe goes in
to a round black cylinder that looks like a
fuel pump.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wu/Henry/Henry Wu</b></font>)</div>Wu said. <div class="bookquote">``That's exactly what it is

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A valve?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It should be sticking up at the top, with a little

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay. Twist it open.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Air is coming out.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Good.

'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-now liquid is coming out. It smells like gas.''
``Okay. Close the valve.'' Wu turned to Muldoon, shak
ing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) head. ``Pump lost its prime. Alan?''
``Yes.''
``Try the buttons again.''
A moment later, Wu heard the faint coughing and spu
ttering as the generator turned over, and
then the steady chugging sound as it caught. ``It's
on,'' Grant said.
``Good work, Alan! Good work!''
``Now what?'' Grant said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sounded flat, dull. ``The
lights haven't even come on in here.''
``Go back to the control room, and I'll talk you thr
ough restoring the systems manually.''
``That's what I have to do now?<div class="bookquote">''
''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Yes.''
``Okay,'' Grant said. ``I'll call you when I get there
.'' There was a final hiss, and silence.
``Alan?''
The radio was dead.
Tim went through the swinging doors at the back of
the dining room and entered the kitchen. A
big stainless-steel table in the center of the room
, a big stove with lots of burners to the left, and
,
beyond that, big walk-in refrigerators. Tim started
opening the refrigerators, looking for ice cream.
Smoke came out in the humid air as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) opened each o
ne.
``How come the stove is on?'' Lex said, releasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
hand.
``It's not on.''
``They all have little blue flames.''
``Those're pilot lights.''
``What're pilot lights?'' They had an electric stove
at home.
``Never mind,'' Tim said, opening another refrigerato
r. ``But it means I can cook you something.''
In this next refrigerator, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) found all kinds of st
uff, cartons of milk, and piles of vegetables, and
a
stack of T-bone steaks, fish-but no ice cream.
``You still want ice cream?''
``I told you, didn't I?''
The next refrigerator was huge. A stainless steel d
oor, with a wide horizontal handle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
tugged on the handle, pulled it open, and saw a wal
k-in freezer. It was a whole room, and it was
freezing cold.
``Timmy ...''
``Will you wait a minute?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said, annoyed. ``I'm tr
ying to find your ice cream.
<div class="bookquote">``Timmy ... something's here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was whispering, and for a moment the last two w
ords didn't register. Then Tim hurried
back out of the freezer, seeing the edge of the wre
athed in glowing green smoke. Lex stood by
the steel worktable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was looking back to the ki
tchen door.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) heard a low hissing sound, like a very large sna
ke. The sound rose and fell softly. It was
hardly audible. It might even be the wind, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) s
omehow knew it wasn't.
<div class="bookquote">``Timmy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``I'm scared.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) crept forward to the kitchen door and looked out
. In the darkened dining room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) saw the
orderly green rectangular pattern of the tabletops.
And moving smoothly among them, silent as a
ghost except for the hissing of its breath, was a v
elociraptor.
In the darkness of the maintenance room, Grant felt
along the pipes, moving back toward the
ladder. It was difficult to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) way in the dar
k, and somehow he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) found the noise of the
generator disorienting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) came to the ladder, and
had started back up when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) realized there
was something else in the room besides generator no
ise.
Grant paused, listening.
It was a man shouting.
It sounded like Gennaro.
<div class="bookquote">``Where are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant shouted.
<div class="bookquote">``Over here, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``In the truck.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant couldn't see any truck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) squinted in the da
rkness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) looked out of the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
eye. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw green glowing shapes, moving in the dar
kness. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw the truck, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
turned toward it.
Tim found the silence chilling.
The velociraptor was six feet tall, and powerfully
built, although its strong legs and tail were
hidden by the tables. Tim could see only the muscul
ar upper torso, the two forearms held tightly
alongside the body, the claws dangling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could se
e the iridescent speckled pattern on the
back. The velociraptor was alert; as it came forwar
d, it looked from side to side, moving its head
with abrupt, bird-like jerks. The head also bobbed
up and down as it walked, and the long straight
tail dipped, which heightened the impression of a b
ird.
A gigantic, silent bird of prey.
The dining room was dark, but apparently the raptor
could see well enough to move steadily
forward. From time to time, it would bend over, low
ering its head below the tables. Tim heard a
rapid sniffing sound. Then the head would snap up,
alertly, jerking back and fortb like a bird's.
Tim watched until he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was sure the velociraptor was
coming toward the kitchen. Was it
following their scent? All the books said dinosaurs
had a poor sense of smell, but this one
seemed to do just fine. Anyway, what did books know
? Here was the real thing.
Coming toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) ducked back into the kitchen.
<div class="bookquote">``Is something out there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
Tim didn't answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) under a table in t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) corner, behind a large waste bin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
leaned close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) and whispered fiercely: <div class="bookquote">``Stay h
ere!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) ran for the refrigerator.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) grabbed a handful of cold steaks and hurried bac
k to the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) quietly placed the first of
the steaks on the floor, then moved back a few step
s, and put down the second... .
Through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) goggles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw Lex peeping around the
bin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) placed the
third steak, and the fourth, moving deeper into the
kitchen.
The hissing was louder, and then the clawed hand gr
ipped the door, and the big head peered
cautiously around.
The velociraptor paused at the entrance to the kitc
hen.
Tim stood in a half-crouch at the back of the room,
near the far leg of the steel worktable. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) had not had time to conceal himself; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) head an
d shoulders still protruded over the tabletop.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was in clear view of the velociraptor.
Slowly, Tim lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) body, sinking beneath the t
able... . The velociraptor jerked its head
around, looking directly at Tim.
Tim froze. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was still exposed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) thought, Do
n't move. The
velociraptor stood motionless in the doorway. Sniff
ing.
It's darker here, Tim thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) can't see so well
. It's making him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) cautious.
But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could smell the musty odor of the big re
ptile, and through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) goggles he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw the
dinosaur silently yawn, throwing back its long snou
t, exposing rows of razor-sharp teeth. The
velociraptor stared forward again, jerking its head
from side to side. The big eyes swiveled in the
bony sockets.
Tim felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) heart pounding. Somehow it was worse t
o be confronted by an animal like this in a
kitchen, instead of the open forest. The size, the
quick movements, the pungent odor, the hissing
breath ...
Up close, it was a much more frightening animal tha
n the tyrannosaur. The Tyrannosaur was
huge and powerful, but it wasn't especially smart.
The velociraptor was man-size, and it was
clearly quick and intelligent; Tim feared the searc
hing eyes almost as much as the sharp teeth.
The velociraptor sniffed. It stepped forward-moving
directly toward Lex! It must smell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>),
somehow! Tim's heart thumped.
The velociraptor stopped. It bent over slowly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)'s found the steak.
Tim wanted to bend down, to look below the table, b
ut he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) didn't dare move. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) stood frozen in
a half-crouch, listening to the crunching sound. Th
e dinosaur was eating it. Bones and all.
The raptor raised its slender head, and looked arou
nd. It sniffed. It saw the second steak. It
moved quickly forward. It bent down.
Silence.
The raptor didn't eat it.
The head came back up. Tim's legs burned from the c
rouch, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) didn't move.
Why hadn't the animal eaten the second steak? A doz
en ideas flashed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) mind-it
didn't like the taste of beef, it didn't like the c
oldness, it didn't like the fact that the meat wasn
't
alive, it smelled a trap, it smelled Lex, it smelle
d Tim, it saw Tim-
The velociraptor moved very quickly now. It found t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) third steak, dipped its head, looked up
again, and moved on.
Tim held his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) breath. The dinosaur was now just a fe
w feet from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>), Tim could see the small
twitches in the muscles of the flanks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could see
the crusted blood on the claws of the hand.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could see the fine pattern of striations within
the spotted pattern, and the folds of skin in the
neck below the jaw.
The velociraptor sniffed. It jerked its head, and l
ooked right at Tim. Tim nearly gasped with
fright. Tim's body was rigid, tense. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) watched as
the reptile eye moved, scanning the room.
Another sniff.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)'s got me, Tim thought.
Then the head jerked back to look forward, and the
animal went on, toward the fifth steak. Tim
thought, Lex please don't move please don't move wh
atever you do please don't ...
The velociraptor sniffed the steak, and moved on. I
t was now at the open door to the freezer.
Tim could see the smoke billowing out, curling alon
g the floor toward the animal's feet. One big
clawed foot lifted, then came down again, silently.
The dinosaur hesitated. Too cold, Tim thought.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) won't go in there, it's too cold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) won't go in
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) won't go in he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) won't go in... .
The dinosaur went in.
The head disappeared, then the body, then the stiff
tail.
Tim sprinted, flinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) weight against the stain
less-steel door of the locker, slamming it shut.
It slammed on the tip of the tail! The door wouldn'
t shut! The velociraptor roared, a terrifying loud
sound. Inadvertently, Tim took a step back-the tail
was gone! He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) slammed the door shut and
heard it click! Closed!
<div class="bookquote">``Lex! Lex!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was screaming. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) heard the raptor p
ounding against the door, felt it thumping
the steel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) knew there was a flat steel knob insi
de, and if the raptor hit that, it would knock the
door open. They had to get the door locked. <div class="bookquote">``Lex!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex was by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) side. <div class="bookquote">``What do you want!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim leaned against the horizontal door handle, hold
ing it shut. <div class="bookquote">``There's a pin! A little pin! Get
the pin!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The velociraptor roared like a lion, the sound muff
led by the thick steel. It crashed its whole
body against the door.
<div class="bookquote">``I can't see anything!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex shouted.
The pin was dangling beneath the door handle, swing
ing on a little metal chain. <div class="bookquote">``It's right
there!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't see it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) screamed, and then Tim realiz
ed she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wasn't wearing the goggles.
<div class="bookquote">``Feel for it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) little hand reaching up, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>), g
roping for the pin, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) so close to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could feel how frightened she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) breat
h in little panicky gasps as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) felt for the pin,
and the velociraptor slammed against the door and i
t opened-God, it opened-but the animal
hadn't expected that and had already turned back fo
r another try and Tim slammed the door shut
again. Lex scrambled back, reached up in the darkne
ss.
<div class="bookquote">``I have it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex cried, clutching the pin in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ha
nd, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) pushed it through the hole. It slid
out again.
<div class="bookquote">``From the top, put it in from the top!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) held it again, lifting it on the chain, swingin
g it over the handle, and down. Into the hole.
Locked.
The velociraptor roared. Tim and Lex stepped back f
rom the door as the dinosaur slammed
into it again. With each impact, the heavy steel wa
ll hinges creaked, but they held. Tim didn't
think the animal could possibly open the door.
The raptor was locked in.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) gave a long sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Let's go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)

<p/>took her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand, and they ran.
<div class="bookquote">``You should have seen them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said, as Grant
led him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) back out of the maintenance
building. <div class="bookquote">``There must have been two dozen of them.
Compys. I had to crawl into the truck to get
away from them. They were all over the windshield.
Just squatting there, waiting like buzzards.
But they ran away when you came over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Scavengers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``They won't attack anythi
ng that's moving or looks strong. They
attack things that are dead, or almost dead. Anyway
, unmoving.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They were going up the ladder now, back toward the
entrance door.
<div class="bookquote">``What happened to the raptor that attacked you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Gr
ant said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``Did it leave?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I didn't see. I got away, I think because it was i
njured. I think Muldoon shot it in the leg and it
was bleeding while it was in here. Then ... I don
't know. Maybe it went back outside. Maybe it
died in here. I didn't see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And maybe it's still in here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
Wu stared out the lodge window at the raptors beyon
d the fence. They still seemed playful,
making mock attacks at Ellie. The behavior had cont
inued for a long time now, and it occurred to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) that it might be too long. It almost seemed as
if they were trying to keep Ellie's attention, in
the same way that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was trying to keep theirs.
The behavior of the dinosaurs had always been a min
or consideration for Wu. And rightly so:
behavior was a second-order effect of DNA, like pro
tein enfolding. You couldn't really predict
behavior, and you couldn't really control it, excep
t in very crude ways, like making an animal
dependent on a dietary substance by withholding an
enzyme. But, in general, behavioral effects
were simply beyond the reach of understanding. You
couldn't look at a DNA sequence and
predict behavior. It was impossible.
And that had made Wu's DNA work purely empirical. I
t was a matter of tinkering, the way a
modern workman might repair an antique grandfather
clock. You were dealing with something out
of the past, something constructed of ancient mater
ials and following ancient rules. You couldn't
be certain why it worked as it did, and it had been
repaired and modified many times already, by
forces of evolution, over eons of time. So, like th
e workman who makes an adjustment and then
sees if the clock runs any better, Wu would make an
adjustment and then see if the animals
behaved any better. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) only tried to correct gr
oss behavior: uncontrolled butting of the
electrical fences, or rubbing the skin raw on tree
trunks. Those were the behaviors that sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>)
back to the drawing board.
And the limits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) science had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) with a m
ysterious feeling about the dinosaurs in the
park. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) was never sure, never really sure at all,
whether the behavior of the animals was
historically accurate or not. Were they behaving as
they really had in the past? It was an open
question, ultimately unanswerable.
And though Wu would never admit it, the discovery t
hat the dinosaurs were breeding
represented a tremendous validation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) work. A
breeding animal was demonstrably effective
in a fundamental way; it implied that Wu had put al
l the pieces together correctly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) had re-
created an animal millions of years old, with such
precision that the creature could even
reproduce itself.
But, still, looking at the raptors outside, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) was
troubled by the persistence of their behavior.
Raptors were intelligent, and intelligent animals g
ot bored quickly. Intelligent animals also formed
plans, and-

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Raptors</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Raptors</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I know what I'm doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Raptors</b></font>) sa

<div class="bookquote">``Now, Ellie, damn it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon didn't like Wu standing there with the door
open, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) was about to say so, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) saw a shadow descend from above, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) realized
at once what had happened. Wu was
yanked bodily out the door, and Muldoon heard Ellie
screaming. Muldoon got to the door and
looked out and saw that Wu was lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) back, h
is body already torn open by the big claw,
and the raptor was jerking its head, tugging at Wu'
s intestines even though Wu was still alive, still
feebly reaching up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) hands to push the big h
ead away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) was being eaten while he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) was
still alive, and then Ellie stopped screaming and s
tarted to run along the inside of the fence, and
Muldoon slammed the door shut, dizzy with horror. I
t had happened so fast!
Harding said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) jumped down from the roof?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Muldoon nodded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) went to the window and looked ou
t, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) saw that the three raptors
outside the fence were now running away. But they w
eren't following Ellie.
They were going back, toward the visitor center.
Grant came to the edge of the maintenance building
and peered forward, in the fog. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could
hear the snarls of the raptors, and they seemed to
be coming closer. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could see their
bodies running past him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). They were going to the vis
itor center.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) looked back at Gennaro.

<p/>Gennaro shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) head, no.
Grant leaned close and whispered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) ear. <div class="bookquote">``No ch
oice. We've got to turn on the computer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant set out in the fog.
After a moment, Gennaro followed.
Ellie didn't stop to think. When the raptors droppe
d inside the fence to attack Wu, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) just turned
and ran, as fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) could, toward the far end o
f the lodge. There was a space fifteen feet
wide between the fence and the lodge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) ran, not
hearing the animals pursuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>), just
hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) own breath. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) rounded the corner, saw
a tree growing by the side of the building,
and leapt, grabbing a branch, swinging up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) didn
't feel panic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) felt a kind of exhilaration as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) kicked and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) legs rise up In front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) hooked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) legs over a branch
farther up, tightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) gut, and pulled up quickl
y.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was already twelve feet off the ground, and the
raptors still weren't following her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
was beginning to feel pretty good, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) saw the
first animal at the base of the tree. Its mouth
was bloody, and bits of stringy flesh hung from its
jaws. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) continued to go up fast, hand over
hand, just reaching and going, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) could almost
see the top of the building. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) looked down
again.
The two raptors were climbing the tree.
Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was at the level of the rooftop, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) could
see the gravel only four feet away, and the
glass pyramids of the skylights, sticking up in the
mist. There was a door on the roof; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) could
get inside. In a single heaving effort she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) flung he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)
rself through the air, and landed sprawling on
the gravel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) scraped her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) face, but somehow the o
nly sensation was exhilaration, as if it were a
kind of game she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was playing, a game she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) intended t
o win. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) ran for the door that led to the
stairwell. Behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) could hear the raptors s
haking the branches of the tree. They were still
in the tree.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) reached the door, and twisted the knob. The doo
r was locked.
It took a moment for the meaning of that to cut thr
ough her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) euphoria. The door was locked.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was on the roof and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) couldn't get down. The
door was locked.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) pounded on the door in frustration, and then sh
e ran for the far side of the roof, hoping to
see a way down, but there was only the green outlin
e of the swimming pool through the blowing
mist. All around the pool was concrete decking. Ten
, twelve feet of concrete. Too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) to
jump across. No other trees to climb down. No stair
s. No fire escape.
Nothing.
Ellie turned back, and saw the raptors jumping easi
ly to the roof. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) ran to the far end of the
building, hoping there might be another door there,
but there wasn't.
The raptors came slowly toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>), stalking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>), s
lipping silently among the glass pyramids.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) looked down. The edge of the pool was ten feet
away.
Too far.
The raptors were closer, starting to move apart, an
d illogically she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) thought: Isn't this always the
way? Some little mistake screws it all up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) stil
l felt giddy, still felt exhilaration, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
somehow couldn't believe these animals were going t
o get her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) couldn't believe that now her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
life was going to end like this. It didn't seem pos
sible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was enveloped in a kind of protective
cheerfulness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) just didn't believe it would happ
en.
The raptors snarled. Ellie backed away, moving to t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) far end of the roof. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) took a breath,
and then began to sprint toward the edge. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) ra
ced toward the edge, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) saw the swimming
pool, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) knew it was too far away but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) thou
ght, What the hell, and leapt into space.
And fell.
And with a stinging shock, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) felt herself envelop
ed in coldness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was underwater. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
had done it! She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) came to the surface and looked up
at the roof, and saw the raptors looking
down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) knew that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) could do it,
the raptors could do it, too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) splashed in
the water and thought, Can raptors swim? But she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) wa
s sure they could. They could probably
swim like crocodiles.
The raptors turned away from the edge of the roof.
And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) heard Harding calling
<div class="bookquote">``Sattler?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had opened the roof
door. The raptors were going toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>).
Hurriedly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) climbed out of the pool and ran towa
rd the lodge.
Harding had gone up the steps to the roof two at a
time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) had flung open the door without
thinking. <div class="bookquote">``Sattler!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) shouted. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) stoppe
d. Mist blew among the pyramids on the roof.
The raptors were not in sight.
<div class="bookquote">``Sattler!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) was so preoccupied with Sattler that it was a mo
ment before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) realized his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) mistake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
should be able to see the animals, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) thought. In t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) next instant the clawed forearm smashed
around the side of the door, catching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) in the ch
est with a tearing pain, and it took all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
effort to pull himself backward and close the door
on the arm, and from downstairs he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) heard
Muldoon sbouting, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>)'s here, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>)'s already inside
.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>From the other side of the door, the raptor snarled
, and Harding slammed the door again, and
the claws pulled back, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) closed the door with
a metallic clang and sank coughing to the
floor.
<div class="bookquote">``Where are we going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. They were on the se
cond floor of the visitor center. A glass-
walled corridor ran the length of the building.
``To the control room , Tim said.
``Where's that?''
``Down here someplace.'' Tim looked at the names sten
ciled on the doors as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) went past
them. These seemed to be offices: PARK WARDEN GUEST
SERVICES ... GENERAL
MANAGER ... COMPTROLLER ...
They came to a glass partition marked with a sign:
CLOSED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY
BEYOND THIS POINT
There was a slot for a security card, but Tim just
pushed the door open.
``How come it opened?''
``The power is out,'' Tim said.
``Why're we going to the control room?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) asked.
``To find a radio. We need to call somebody.''
Beyond the glass door the hallway continued. Tim re
membered this area; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) had seen it
earlier, during the tour. Lex trotted along at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
side. In the distance, they heard the snarling of
raptors. The animals seemed to be approaching. Then
Tim heard them slamming against the
glass downstairs.
``They're out there ...'' Lex whispered.
``Don't worry.''
``What are they doing here?'' Lex said.
``Never mind now.''
PARK SUPERVISOR ... OPERATIONS ... MAIN CONTROL
...
``Here,'' Tim said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) pushed open the door. The main
control room was as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) had seen it
before. In the center of the room was a console wit
h four chairs and four computer monitors. The
room was entirely dark except for the monitors, whi
ch all showed a series of colored rectangles.
``So where's a radio?'' Lex said.
But Tim had forgotten all about a radio. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) moved f
orward, staring at the computer screens.
The screens were on! That could only mean-
``The power must be back on...''
``Ick,'' Lex said, shifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) body.
``What.''
``I was standing on somebody's ear, '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said.
Tim hadn't seen a body when they came in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) looked
back and saw there was just an ear,
lying on the floor.
``That is really disgusting,'' Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``Never mind.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) turned to the monitors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's the rest of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Never mind that now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) peered closely at the monitor. There were rows o
f colored labels on the screen:


<p/><div class="bookquote">``You better not fool around with that, Timmy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
said.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't worry, I won't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had seen complicated computers before, like the
ones that were installed in the buildings
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) father worked on. Those computers controlled ev
erything from the elevators and security to
the heating and cooling systems. They looked basica
lly like this-a lot of colored labels-but they
were usually simpler to understand. And almost alwa
ys there was a help label, if you needed to
learn about the system. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) saw no help label he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
re. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) looked again, to be sure.
But then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) saw something else: numerals clicking i
n the upper left corner of the screen. They
read 10:47:22. Then Tim realized it was the time. T
here were only thirteen minutes left for the
boat-but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was more worried about the people in th
e lodge.
There was a static crackle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) turned, and saw Lex
holding a radio. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) was twisting the
knobs and dials. <div class="bookquote">``How does it work?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I c
an't make it work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Give me that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's mine! I found it!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>``Give it

<p/>to me, Lex!'' ``I get to use it

<p/>first!''
``Lex!''
Suddenly, the radio crackled. ``What the hell is goi
ng on!'' said Muldoon's voice.
Surprised, Lex dropped the radio on the floor.
Grant ducked back, crouching among the palm trees.
Through the mist ahead he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) could see the
raptors hopping and snarling and butting their head
s against the glass of the visitor center. But,
between snarls, they would fall silent and cock the
ir heads, as if listening to something distant.
And then they would make little whimpering sounds.
``What're they doing?'' Gennaro said.
``It looks like they're trying to get into the cafet
eria,'' Grant said. ``What's in the cafeteria?'' ``I
left the kids there ...'' Grant said.
``Can they break through that glass?''
``I don't think so, no.''
Grant watched, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heard the crackle of a di
stant radio, and the raptors began
hopping in a more agitated way. One after another,
they began jumping higher and higher, until
finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw the first of them leap lightly onto
the second-floor balcony, and from there move
inside the second floor of the visitor center.
In the control room on the second floor, Tim snatch
ed up the radio which Lex had dropped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
pressed the button. ``Hello? Hello?<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>-s that you, Tim?'' It was Muldoon's voice.
``It's me, yes.''
``Where are you?''
<div class="bookquote">``In the control room. The power is on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's great, Tim,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
<div class="bookquote">``If someone will tell me how to turn the computer o
n, I'll do it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a silence.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said. <div class="bookquote">``Did you hear me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, we have a problem about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">''
Nobody, ah, who is here knows how to do
that. How to turn the computer on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Tim said, <div class="bookquote">``What, are you kidding? Nobody knows?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>It
seemed incredible.
<div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A pause. <div class="bookquote">``I think it's something about the ma
in grid. Turning on the main grid ... You
know anything about computers, Tim?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim stared at the screen. Lex nudged him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
no, Timmy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, some. I know something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
<div class="bookquote">``Might as well try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody here kno
ws what to do. And Grant doesn't know
about computers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said. <div class="bookquote">``I'll try.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) clicked off the ra
dio and stared at the screen, studying it.
<div class="bookquote">``Timmy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know what to do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes I do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If you know, then do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``Just a minute.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As a way to get started, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) pulled
the chair close to the keyboard and pressed
the cursor keys. Those were the keys that moved the
cursor around on the screen. But nothing
happened. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) pushed other keys. The screen rem
ained unchanged.
<div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Something's wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said, frowning. <div class="bookquote">``You

<p/>just don't know, Timmy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) examined the computer again, looking at it caref
ully. The keyboard had a row of function
keys at the top, just like a regular PC keyboard, a
nd the monitor was big and in color. But the
monitor housing was sort of unusual. Tim looked at
the edges of the screen and saw lots of faint
pinpoints of red light.
Red light, all around the borders of the screen . .
. What could that be? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) finger
toward the light and saw the soft red glow on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) s
kin.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) touched the screen and heard a beep.

<p/>A moment later, the message box disappeared, and th
e original screen flashed back up.
<div class="bookquote">``What happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``What did you do? You to
uched something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Of course! he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had touched the screen. I
t was a touch screen! The red lights
around the edges must be infrared sensors. Tim had
never seen such a screen, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)'d read
about them in magazines. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) touched
RESET/REVERT.
Instantly the screen changed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) got a new message:

<p/>THE COMPUTER IS NOW RESET
MAKE YOUR SELECTION FROM THE MAIN SCREEN
Over the radio, they heard the sound of raptors sna
rling. <div class="bookquote">``I want to see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``You should
try VIEW.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Lex.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I want VIEW,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said. And before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) could
grab her (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) had pressed VIEW.
The screen changed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Uh-oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Lex, will you cut it out?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``it worked! Ha!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Around the room, the monitors showed quickly changi
ng views of different parts of the park,
Most of the images were misty gray, because of the
exterior fog, but one showed the outside of
the lodge, with a raptor on the roof, and then anot
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) switched to an image in bright sunlight,
showing the bow of a ship, bright sunlight-
<div class="bookquote">``What was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said, leaning forward.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That picture!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But the image had already changed, and now they wer
e seeing the inside of the lodge, one
room after another, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw Malcolm, lying
in a bed-
<div class="bookquote">``Stop it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``I see them!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim touched the screen in several places, and got s
ubmenus. Then more submenus.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``You're confusing it...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will you shut up! You don't know anything about co
mputers!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had a list of monitors on the screen. One of
them was marked SAFARI LODGE: LV2-
4. Another was REMOTE: SHIPBOARD -LRB-VND-RRB-. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) pressed
the screen several times.
Video images came up on monitors around the room. O
ne showed the bow of the supply ship,
and the ocean ahead. In the distance, Tim saw land-
buildings along a shore, and a harbor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
recognized the harbor because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) had flown over it
in the helicopter the day before. It was
Puntarenas. The ship seemed to be just minutes from
landing.
But his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) attention was drawn by the next screen, whi
ch showed the roof of the safari lodge, in
gray mist. The raptors were mostly bidden behind th
e pyramids, but their heads bobbed up and
down, coming into view.
And then, on the third monitor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could see inside
a room. Malcolm was lying in a bed, and
Ellie stood next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>). They were both looking upw
ard. As they watched, Muldoon walked into
the room, and joined them, looking up with an expre
ssion of concern.
<div class="bookquote">``They see us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't think so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The radio crackled. On the screen, Muldoon lifted t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) radio to his (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``Hello, Tim?''

The Grid
Tim suddenly found himself lost in a tangled series
of monitor control screens, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) tried to get
back to the main screen. Most systems had a single
button or a single command to return to the
previous screen, or to the main menu. But this syst
em did not-or at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) didn't know it. Also,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was certain that help commands had been built in
to the system, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) couldn't find them,
either, and Lex was jumping up and down and shoutin
g in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) ear, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) nervous.
Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) got the main screen back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) wasn't sure
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had done, but it was back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
paused, looking for a command.
``Do something, Timmy!''
<div class="bookquote">``Will you shut up? I'm trying to get help.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) push
ed TEMPLATE-MAIN. The screen filled with
a complicated diagram, with interconnecting boxes a
nd arrows.
No good. No good.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) pushed COMMON INTERFACE. The screen shifted:



<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``Why aren't you turning on
the power, Timmy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) ignored her (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>). Maybe help on this system was calle

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tim-ee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex wailed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had already pushed FIN
D. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) got another useless window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
pushed GO BACK.
On the radio, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) heard Muldoon say, <div class="bookquote">``How's it comin
g, Tim?''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) didn't bother to answer.
Frantic, he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) pushed buttons one after another.
Suddenly, without warning, the main screen was back
.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) studied the screen. ELECTRICAL MAIN and SETGRIDS
DNL both looked like they might
have something to do with grids. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) noticed that SA
FETY/HEALTH and CRITICAL LOCKS might
be important, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) heard the growl of the raptor
s. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) had to make a choice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) pressed
SETGRIDS DNL, and groaned when he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) saw it:


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) didn't know what to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) pushed STANDARD PARAM

Tim shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) head in frustration. It took him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) a mo

valuable information. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) now knew the grid coordina

Tim tried to stay calm, to think it through. For so
me reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was getting a consistent error
message whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) tried to turn on a grid. It was
saying the power was incompatible with the
command he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was giving. But what did that mean? Why
was power incompatible?
<div class="bookquote">``Timmy ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, tugging at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) arm.
`Not now, Lex.''
``Yes, now, '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) away from
the screen and the console. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
heard the snarling of raptors.
It was coming from the hallway.
In the skylight above Malcolm's bed, the raptors ha
d almost bitten through the second metal bar.
They could now poke their heads entirely through th
e shattered glass, and lunge and snarl at the
people below. Then after a moment they would pull b
ack, and resume chewing on the metal.
Malcolm said, ``It won't be long now. Three, four mi
nutes.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) pressed the button on the radio:
``Tim, are you there? Tim?''
There was no answer.
Tim slipped out the door and saw the velociraptor,
down at the far end of the corridor, standing by
the balcony, He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) stared in astonishment. How had it
gotten out of the freezer?
Then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) watched, a second raptor suddenly appea
red on the balcony, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) understood.
The raptor hadn't come from the freezer at all. It
had come from outside. It had jumped from the
ground below. The second raptor landed silently, pe
rfectly balanced on the railing. Tim couldn't
believe it. The big animal had jumped ten feet stra
ight up. More than ten feet. Their legs must be
incredibly powerful.
Lex whispered, ``I thought you said they couldn't-''
``Ssshh.'' Tim was trying to think, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) watched wi
th a kind of fascinated dread as the third
raptor leapt to the balcony. The animals milled aim
lessly in the corridor for a moment, and then
they began to move forward in single file. Coming t
oward him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) and Lex.
Quietly, Tim pushed against the door at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) back, t
o re-enter the control room. But the door
was stuck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) pushed harder.
``We're locked out,'' Lex whispered. ``Look.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) poin
ted to the slot for the security card
alongside the door. A bright red dot glowed. Someho
w the security doors had been activated.
``You idiot, you locked us out!''
Tim looked down the corridor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw several more d
oors, but each had a red light glowing
alongside. That meant all the doors were locked. Th
ere was nowhere they could go.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) saw a slumped shape on the floor at the far
end of the corridor. It was a dead guard. A
white security card was clipped to his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) belt.
``Come on,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) whispered. They ran for the guard. Ti
m got the card, and turned back. But of
course the raptors had seen them. They snarled, and
blocked the way back to the control room.
They began to spread apart, fanning out in the hall
way to surround Tim and Lex. Their heads
began to duck rhythmically.
They were going to attack.
Tim did the only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could do. Using the card,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) opened the nearest door off the hallway
and pushed Lex through. As the door began to close
slowly behind them, the raptors hissed and
charged.
Lodge
Ian Malcolm drew each breath as if it might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>)
last. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) watched the raptors with dull eyes.
Harding took his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) blood pressure, frowned, took it a
gain. Ellie Sattler was wrapped in a blanket,
shivering and cold. Muldoon sat on the floor, propp
ed against the wall. Hammond was staring
upward, not speaking. They all listened to the radi
o.
``What happened to Tim?'' Hammond said. ``Still no wor
d?''
``I don't know.''
Malcolm said, ``Ugly, aren't they. Truly ugly.''
Hammond shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) head. ``Who could have imagined it
would turn out this way.''
Ellie said, ``Apparently Malcolm did.''
``I didn't imagine it,'' Malcolm said. ``I calculated
it.''
Hammond sighed. ``No more of this, please. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>)'s been
saying 'I told you so' for hours. But
nobody ever wanted this to happen.''
``It isn't a matter of wanting it or not,'' Malcolm s
aid, eyes closed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) spoke slowly, through the
drugs. ``It's a matter of what you think you can acc
omplish. When the hunter goes out in the rain
forest to seek food for his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) family, does he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) expect
to control nature? No. He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) imagines that nature is
beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>). Beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) understanding. Beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) co
ntrol. Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) prays to nature, to the
fertility of the forest that provides for him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) p
rays because he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) doesn't control it. He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>)'s a

<div class="bookquote">``But you decide you won't be at the mercy of nature

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And Grant, too. What happened to Grant?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant reached the rear door to the visitor center,
the same door he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) had left twenty minutes
before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) tugged on the handle: it was locked. The
n he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) saw the little red light. The security
doors were reactivated! Damn! He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) ran around to the
front of the building, and went through the
shattered front doors into the main lobby, stopping
by the guard desk where he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had been earlier.
He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) could hear the dry hiss of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) radio. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) went to
the kitchen, looking for the kids, but the
kitchen door was open, the kids gone.
He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) went upstairs but came to the glass panel marked
CLOSED AREA and the door was
locked. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) needed a security card to go farther.
Grant couldn't get in.
From somewhere inside the hallway, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heard the rap
tors snarling.
The leathery reptile skin touched Tim's face, the c
laws tore his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) shirt, and Tim fell onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) back,
shrieking in fright.
<div class="bookquote">``Timmy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex yelled.
Tim scrambled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) feet again. The baby velocirap
tor perched on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) shoulder, chirping and
squeaking in panic. Tim and Lex were in the white n
ursery. There were toys on the floor: a rolling
yellow ball, a doll, a plastic rattle.
<div class="bookquote">``It's the baby raptor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, pointing to the a
nimal gripping Tim's shoulder.
The little raptor burrowed its head into Tim's neck
. The poor thing was probably starving, Tim
thought.
Lex came closer and the baby hopped onto her (<font color='blue'><b>baby</b></font>) should
er. It rubbed against her (<font color='blue'><b>baby</b></font>) neck. <div class="bookquote">``Why is it
doing that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>baby</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Is it scared?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
She (<font color='blue'><b>baby</b></font>) passed the raptor back to Tim. The baby was chi
rping and squeaking, and hopping up
and down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) shoulder excitedly. It kept looking
around, head moving quickly. No doubt about
it, the little thing was worked up and-
<div class="bookquote">``Tim,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex whispered.
The door to the hallway laadn't closed behind them
after they entered the nursery. Now the big
velociraptors were coming through. First one, then
a second one.
Clearly agitated, the baby chirped and bounced on T
im's shoulder. Tim knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) had to get
away. Maybe the baby would distract them. After all
, it was a baby raptor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) plucked the little
animal from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) shoulder and threw it across the ro
om. The baby scurried between the legs of the
adults. The first raptor lowered its snout, sniffed
at the baby delicately,
Tim took Lex's hand, and pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) deeper into the
nursery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) had to find a door, a way to
get out-
There was a high piercing shriek. Tim looked back t
o see the baby in the jaws of the adult. A
second velociraptor came forward and tore at the li
mbs of the infant, trying to pull it from the
mouth of the first. The two raptors fought over the
baby as it squealed. Blood splattered in large
drops onto the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``They ate him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
The raptors fought over the remains of the baby, re
aring back and butting heads. Tim found a
door-it was unlocked-and went through, pulling Lex
after him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>).
They were in another room, and from the deep green
glow he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) realized it was the deserted
DNA-extraction laboratory, the rows of stereo micro
scopes abandoned, the high-resolution
screens showing frozen, giant black-and-white image
s of insects. The flies and gnats that had
bitten dinosaurs millions of years ago, sucking the
blood that now had been used to re-create
dinosaurs in the park. They ran through the laborat
ory, and Tim could hear the snorts and snarls of
the raptors, pursuing them, coming closer, and then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) went to the back of the lab and through a
door that must have had an alarm, because in the na
rrow corridor an intermittent siren sounded
shrilly, and the lights overhead flashed on and off
. Running down the corridor, Tim was plunged
into darkness-then light again-then darkness. Over
the sound of the alarm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) heard the raptors
snort as they pursued him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>). Lex was whimpering and m
oaning. Tim saw another door ahead, with
the blue biohazard sign, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) slammed into the do
or, and moved beyond it, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
collided with something big and Lex shrieked in ter
ror.
<div class="bookquote">``Take it easy, kids,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>a voice said.
Tim blinked in disbelief. Standing above him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was Dr
. Grant. And next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was Mr. Gennaro.
Outside in the hallway, it had taken Grant nearly t
wo minutes to realize that the dead guard down
in the lobby probably had a security card. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)'d gon
e back and gotten it, and entered the upper
corridor, moving quickly down the hallway. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had f
ollowed the sound of the raptors and found
them fighting in the nursery. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was sure the kids
would have gone to the next room, and had
immediately run to the extractions lab.
And there he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)'d met the kids.
Now the raptors were coming toward them. The animal
s seemed momentarily hesitant,
surprised by the appearance of more people.
Grant pushed the kids into Gennaro's arms and said,
<div class="bookquote">``Take them back someplace safe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Through there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said, pointing over his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) shou
lder to a far door. <div class="bookquote">``Take them to the control
room, if you can. You should all be safe there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
The raptors stood near the door. Grant noticed that
they waited until all the animals were
together, and then they moved forward, as a group.
Pack hunters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) shivered.
<div class="bookquote">``I have a plan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``Now go on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro led the kids away. The raptors continued sl
owly toward Grant, moving past the
supercomputers, past the screens that still blinked
endless sequences of computer-deciphered
code. The raptors came forward without hesitation,
sniffing the floor, repeatedly ducking their
heads.
Grant heard the door click behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) and glanced o
ver his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) shoulder. Everybody was standing
on the other side of the glass door, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>).
Gennaro shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) head.
Grant knew what it meant. There was no door to the
control room beyond. Gennaro and the
kids were trapped in there.
It was up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) now.
Grant moved slowly, edging around the laboratory, l
eading the raptors away from Gennaro and
the kids. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) could see another door, nearer the fro
nt, which was marked TO LABORATORY.
Whatever that meant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) had an idea, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) hoped h
e was right. The door had a blue
biohazard sign. The raptors were coming closer. Gra
nt turned and slammed into the door, and
moved beyond it, into a deep, warm silence.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) turned.
Yes.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) was where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) wanted to be, in the hatchery: bene
ath infrared lights, long tables, with rows
of eggs and a low clinging mist. The rockers on the
tables clicked and whirred in a steady motion.
The mist poured over the sides of the tables and dr
ifted to the floor, where it disappeared,
evaporated.
Grant ran directly to the rear of the hatchery, int
o a glass-walled laboratory with ultraviolet light.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) clothing glowed blue. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) looked around at the g
lass reagents, beakers full of pipettes, glass
dishes ... all delicate laboratory equipment.
The raptors entered the room, cautiously at first,
sniffing the humid air, looking at the long
rocking tables of eggs. The lead animal wiped its b
loody jaws with the back of its forearm. Silently
the raptors passed between the long tables. The ani
mals moved through the room in a
coordinated way, ducking from time to time to peer
beneath the tables.
They were looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>).
Grant crouched, and moved to the back of the labora
tory, looked up, and saw the metal hood
marked with a skull and crossbones. A sign said CAU
TION BIOGENIC TOXINS A4
PRECAUTIONS REQUIRED. Grant remembered that Regis h
ad said they were powerful
poisons. Only a few molecules would kill instantane
ously... .
The hood lay flush against the surface of the lab t
able. Grant could not slip his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) hand under it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) tried to open it, but there was no door, no hand
le, no way that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could see... . Grant rose
slowly, and glanced back at the main room. The rapt
ors were still moving among the tables.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) turned to the hood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw an odd metal fixture
sunk into the surface of the table. It looked
like an outdoor electrical outlet with a round cove
r. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) flipped up the cover, saw a button,
pressed it.
With a soft hiss, the hood slid upward, to the ceil
ing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw glass shelves above him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), and rows of bottles
marked with a skull and crossbones. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
peered at the labels: CCK-5 5 ... TETPA-ALPHA SEC
RETIN ... THYMOLEVIN X-1612... . The
fluids glowed pale green in the ultraviolet light.
Nearby he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw a glass dish with syringes in it.
The syringes were small, each containing a tiny amo
unt of green glowing fluid. Crouched in the
blue darkness, Grant reached for the dish of syring
es. The needles on the syringes were capped in
plastic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) removed one cap, pulling it off with hi
s teeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) looked at the thin needle.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) moved forward. Toward the raptors.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had devoted his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) whole life to studying dinosaurs
. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) would see how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) really
knew. Velociraptors were small carnivorous dinosaur
s, like oviraptors and dromaeosaurs,
animals that were long thought to steal eggs. Just
as certain modern birds ate the eggs of other
birds, Grant had always assumed that velociraptors
would eat dinosaur eggs if they could.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) crept forward to the nearest egg table in the ha
tchery. Slowly he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) reached up into the mist
and took a large egg from the rocking table. The eg
g was almost the size of a football, cream-
colored with faint pink speckling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) held the egg
carefully while he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) stuck the needle through the
shell, and injected the contents of the syringe. Th
e egg glowed faint blue.
Grant bent down again. Beneath the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw th
e legs of the raptors, and the mist pouring
down from the tabletops. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) rolled the glowing egg
along the floor, toward the raptors. The
raptors looked up, hearing the faint rumble as the
egg rolled, and jerked their heads around.
Then they resumed their slow stalking search.
The egg stopped several yards from the nearest rapt
or.
Damn!
Grant did it all again: quietly reaching up for an
egg, bringing it down, injecting it, and rolling it

<p/>toward the raptors. This time, the egg came to rest
by the foot of one velociraptor. It rocked
gently, clicking against the big toe claw.
The raptor looked down in surprise at this new gift
. It bent over and sniffed the glowing egg. It
rolled the egg with its snout along the floor for a
moment.
And ignored it.
The velociraptor stood upright again, and slowly mo
ved on, continuing to search. It
wasn't working.
Grant reached for a third egg, and injected it with
a fresh syringe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) held the glowing egg in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) hands, and rolled it again. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) rolled this
one fast, like a bowling ball. The egg rattled
across the floor loudly.
One of the animals heard the sound-ducked down-saw
it coming and instinctively chased the
moving object, gliding swiftly among the tables to
intercept the egg as it rolled. The big jaws
snapped down and bit into it, crushing the shell.
The raptor stood, pale albumen dripping from its ja
ws. It licked its lips noisily, and snorted. It bit

<p/>again, and lapped the egg from the floor. But it di
dn't seem to be in the least distressed. It bent
over to eat again from the broken egg. Grant looked
down to see what would happen... .
From across the room, the raptor saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). It was lo
oking right at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>).
The velociraptor snarled menacingly. It moved towar
d Grant, crossing the room in long,
incredibly swift strides. Grant was shocked to see
it happening and froze in panic, when suddenly
the animal made a gasping, gurgling sound and the b
ig body pitched forward onto the ground.
The heavy tail thumped the floor in spasms. The rap
tor continued to make choking sounds,
punctuated by intermittent loud shrieks. Foam bubbl
ed from its mouth. The head flopped back
and forth. The tail slammed and thumped.
That's one, Grant thought.
But it wasn't dying very fast. It seemed to take fo
rever to die. Grant reached up for another
egg-and saw that the other raptors in the room were
frozen in mid-action. They listened to the
sound of the dying animal. One cocked its head, the
n another, and another. The first animal
moved to look at the fallen raptor.
The dying raptor was now twitching, the whole body
shaking on the floor. It made pitiful moans.
So much foam bubbled from its mouth that Grant coul
d hardly see the head any more. It flopped
on the floor and moaned again.
The second raptor bent over the fallen animal, exam
ining it. It appeared to be puzzled by these
death throes. Cautiously, it looked at the foaming
head, then moved down to the twitching neck,
the heaving ribs, the legs... .
And it took a bite from the hind leg.
The dying animal snarled, and suddenly lifted its h
ead and twisted, sinking its teeth into the
neck of its attacker.
That's two, Grant thought.
But the standing animal wrenched free. Blood flowed
from its neck. It struck out with its hind
claws, and with a single swift movement ripped open
the belly of the fallen animal. Coils of
intestine fell out like fat snakes. The screams of
the dying raptor filled the room. The attacker
turned away, as if fighting was suddenly too much t
rouble.
It crossed the room, ducked down, and came up with
a glowing egg! Grant watched as the
raptor bit into it, the glowing material dripping d
own its chin.
That makes two.
The second raptor was stricken almost instantly, co
ughing and pitching forward. As it fell, it
knocked over a table. Dozens of eggs rolled everywh
ere across the floor. Grant looked at them in
dismay.
There was still a third raptor left.
Grant had one more syringe. With so many eggs rolli
ng on the floor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) would have to do
something else. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was trying to decide what to do
when the last animal snorted irritably. Grant
looked up-the raptor had spotted him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>).
The final raptor did not move for a long time, it j
ust stared. And then it slowly, quietly came
forward. Stalking him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). Bobbing up and down, looking
first beneath the tables, then above them. It
moved deliberately, cautiously, with none of the sw
iftness that it had displayed in a pack. A
solitary animal now, it was careful. It never took
its eyes off Grant. Grant looked around quickly.
There was nowhere for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) to hide. Nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
to do ...
Grant's gaze was fixed on the raptor, moving slowly
laterally. Grant moved, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) tried to
keep as many tables as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could between himself and
the advancing animal. Slowly ... slowly ...
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) moved to the left... .
The raptor advanced in the dark red gloom of the ha
tchery. Its breath came in soft hisses,
through flared nostrils.
Grant felt eggs breaking beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) feet, the yolk
sticking to the soles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) shoes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
crouched down, felt the bulge of the radio in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) p
ocket.
The radio.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) pulled it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) pocket and turned it on.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello. This is Grant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alan?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie's voice. <div class="bookquote">``Alan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said softly. <div class="bookquote">``Just talk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alan, is that you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) pushed the radio acro
ss the floor, away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), toward the
advancing raptor.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) crouched behind a table leg, and waited.
<div class="bookquote">``Alan, Speak to me, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then a crackle, and silence. The radio remained sil
ent. The raptor advanced, Soft hissing
breath.
The radio was still silent.
What was the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)! Didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) understand
? In the darkness, the raptor came closer,
<div class="bookquote">''... Alan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The tinny voice from the radio made the big animal
pause. It sniffed the air, as if sensing
someone else in the room.
<div class="bookquote">``Alan, it's me. I don't know if you can hear me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>The raptor now turned away from Grant, and moved to
ward the radio.
<div class="bookquote">``Alan ... please ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Why hadn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) pushed the radio farther away? The ra
ptor was going toward it, but it was close.
The big foot came down very near him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). Grant could s
ee the pebbled skin, the soft green glow.
The streaks of dried blood on the curved claw. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) c
ould smell the strong reptile odor.
<div class="bookquote">``Alan, listen to me... . Alan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The raptor bent over, poked at the radio on the flo
or, tentatively. Its body was turned away
from Grant. The big tail was right above Grant's he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
ad. Grant reached up and jabbed the syringe
deep into the flesh of the tail, and injected the p
oison.
The velociraptor snarled and jumped. With frighteni
ng speed it swung back toward Grant, jaws
wide. It snapped, its jaws closing on the table leg
, and jerked its head up. The table was knocked
away, and Grant fell back, now completely exposed.
The raptor loomed over him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), rising up, its
head banging into the infrared lights above, making
them swing crazily.
<div class="bookquote">``Alan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The raptor reared back, and lifted its clawed foot
to kick. Grant rolled, and the foot slammed
down, just missing him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) felt a searing sharp pai
n along his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) shoulder blades, the sudden warm
flow of blood over his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) shirt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) rolled across the
floor, crushing eggs, smearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) hands, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
face. The raptor kicked again, smashing down on the
radio, spattering sparks. It snarled in rage,
and kicked a third time, and Grant came to the wall
, nowhere else to go, and the animal raised its
foot a final time.
And toppled backward.
The animal was wheezing. Foam came from its mouth.
Gennaro and the kids came into the room. Grant sign
aled them to stay back. The girl looked at
the dying animal and said softly, <div class="bookquote">``Wow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>Gennaro helped Grant to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) feet. They all turned,
and ran for the control room.
Control
Tim was astonished to find the screen in the contro
l room was now flashing on and off. Lex said,
<div class="bookquote">``What happened?''



 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div><p/>Tim saw Dr. Grant staring at the screen, and ginger
ly moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) hand toward the keyboard. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't know about computers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said, shaking hi
s head.
But Tim was already sliding into the seat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) touch
ed the screen rapidly. On the video
monitors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could see the boat moving closer to Pu
ntarenas. It was now only about two hundred
yards from the dock. On the other monitor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) lodge, with the raptors hanging down from
the ceiling. On the radio, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heard their snarls.
<div class="bookquote">``Do something, Timmy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) pushed SETGRIDS DNL, even though it was flashing
.
The screen answered:
WARNING: COMMAND EXECUTION ABORTED -LRB-AUX POWER LOW-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``What does that mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said.
Gennaro snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) fingers. <div class="bookquote">``That happened before.
It means auxiliary power is low. You
have to turn on main power.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) pushed ELECTRICAL MAIN.

<p/>Tim groaned.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you doing now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. The whole scr
een was starting to flash.
Tim pushed MAIN.
Nothing happened. The screen continued to flash.
Tim pushed MAIN GRID P. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) felt sick to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) stomach
with fear.
MAIN POWER GRID NOT ACTIVE/AUXILIARY POWER ONLY
The screen was still flashing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) pushed MAIN SET 1
.
MAIN POWER ACTIVATED
All the lights in the room came on. All the monitor
screens stopped flashing. <div class="bookquote">``Hey! All right!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim pressed RESET GRIDS. Nothing happened for a mom
ent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) glanced at the video
monitors, then back at the main screen.
Grant said something that Tim didn't hear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) only
heard the tension in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was
looking at Tim, worried.
Tim felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) heart thumping in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) chest. Lex was y
elling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) didn't want to look at the
video monitor anymore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) could hear the sound of t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) bars bending in the lodge, and the
raptors snarling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) heard Malcolm say, <div class="bookquote">``Dear God.
. .''
 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) pushed LODGE.
SPECIFY GRID NUMBER TO RESET.
For a frozen interminable moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) couldn't rememb
er the number, but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) remembered
F4, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) pressed that.
ACTIVATING LODGE GRID F4 NOW.
On the video monitor he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) saw an explosion of sparks,
sputtering down from the ceiling of the
hotel room. The monitor flared white. Lex shouted <div class="bookquote">''
What did you do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>but almost immediately the
image came back and they could see that the raptors
were caught between the bars, writhing
and screaming in a hot cascade of sparks while Muld
oon and the others cheered, their voices
tinny over the radio.
<div class="bookquote">``That's it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said, slapping Tim on the back.
<div class="bookquote">``That's it! You did it! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>They were all standing and jumping up and down when
Lex said, <div class="bookquote">``What about the ship?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The ship, ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said, and pointed to the screen.
On the monitor, the buildings beyond the bow of the
ship were much larger, and moving to the
right, as the ship turned left and prepared to dock
. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) saw crewmen heading out to the bow,
preparing to tie up.
Tim scrambled back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) seat, and stared at the s
tartup screen.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) studied the screen. TeleCom VBB and TeleCom RSD
both looked like they might have
something to do with telephones. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) pressed TELECOM
RSD.
YOU HAVE 23 WAITING CALLS AND/OR MESSAGES.
DO YOU WISH TO RECEIVE THEM NOW?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) pushed NO.
<div class="bookquote">``Maybe the ship was one of the waiting calls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex
said. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe that way you could get the
phone number!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) ignored her (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>).
ENTER THE NUM13ER YOU WISH TO CALL OR PRESS F7 FOR
DIRECTORY.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) pushed F7 and suddenly names and numbers spilled
over the screen, an enormous
directory. It wasn't alphabetical, and it took a wh
ile to scan it visually before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) found what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
was looking for:
VSL ANNE B. -LRB-FREDDY-RRB- 708-3902
Now all he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) had to do was figure out how to dial. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
pushed a row of buttons at the bottom of
the screen:
DIAL NOW OR DIAL LATER?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) pushed DIAL NOW.
WE'RE SORRY, YOUR CALL CANNOT BE COMPLETED AS DIALE
D.
-LCB-ERROR-5981-RCB-
PLEASE TRY AGAIN
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) tried it again.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) heard a dial tone, then the tone of the numbers
being automatically dialed in rapid
succession.
<div class="bookquote">``Is that it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
<div class="bookquote">``Pretty good, Timmy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``But they're almost
there.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>On the screen, they could see the
prow of the ship closing on the Puntarenas dock. Th
ey heard a high-pitched squeal, and then a
voice said, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, hello, John, this is Freddy. Do yo
u read me, over?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim picked up a phone on the console but heard only
a dial tone.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, hello, John, this is Freddy, over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Answer it''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
Now they were all picking up phones, lifting every
receiver in sight, but they heard only dial
tones. Finally Tim saw a phone mounted on the side
of the console with a blinking light.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, hello, control. This is Freddy. Do you read me
, over?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim grabbed the receiver. <div class="bookquote">``Hello, this is Tim Murph
y, and I need you to-''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, say again, didn't get that, John.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't land the boat! Do you hear me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a pause. Then a puzzled voice said, <div class="bookquote">``Soun
ds like some damn kid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said, <div class="bookquote">``Don't land the ship! Come back to the is
land!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>The voices sounded distant and scratchy. <div class="bookquote">``Did he-na
me was Murphy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And another voice
said, <div class="bookquote">``I didn't get-name.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim looked frantically at the others. Gennaro reach
ed for the phone. <div class="bookquote">``Let me do this. Can you
get his (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) name?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was the sharp crackle of static. <div class="bookquote">''-got to be
a joke or else-a frigging ham operator-
omething.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim was working on the keyboard, there was probably
some kind of a way to find out who
Freddy was...
<div class="bookquote">``Can you hear me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said, into the phone. <div class="bookquote">``I
f you can hear me, answer me now, over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Son,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came the drawled reply, <div class="bookquote">``we don't know who t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) hell you are, but you're not funny, and
we're about to dock and we've got work to do. Now,
identify yourself properly or get off this
channel.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim watched as the screen printed out FARRELL, FRED
ERICK D, -LRB-CAPT.-RRB-.
<div class="bookquote">``Try this for identification, Captain Farrell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gen</b></font>)</div>Gen
naro said. <div class="bookquote">``If you don't turn that boat around
and return to this island immediately, you will be

dollars, and five years in jail. Do you hear that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a silence.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you copy that, Captain Farrell?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And then, distantly, they heard a voice say, <div class="bookquote">``I cop
y,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and another voice said, <div class="bookquote">``All ahead stern.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The boat began to turn away from the dock.
Lex began to cheer. Tim collapsed back in the chair
, wiping the sweat from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) forehead.
Grant said, <div class="bookquote">``What's the Uniform Maritime Act?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>``Who

<p/>the hell knows?'' Gennaro said.
They all watched the screen in satisfaction. The bo
at was definitely heading away from the
shore.
``I guess the hard part's finished,'' Gennaro said. G
rant shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) head. ``The hard part,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
said, is just beginning.''

Destroying the World
They moved Malcolm to another room in the lodge, to
a clean bed. Hammond seemed to revive,
and began bustling around, straightening up, <div class="bookquote">``Well,
''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``at least disaster is averted.''

<div class="bookquote">``All the experts agree that our planet is in troubl

 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Let me tell you about our planet,''

billion years old. There has been life on this plan

years. The first bacteria. And, later, the first mu
lticellular animals, then the first complex
creatures, in the sea, on the land. Then the great
sweeping ages of animals-the amphibians, the
dinosaurs, the mammals, each lasting millions upon
millions of years. Great dynasties of
creatures arising, flourishing, dying away, All thi
s happening against a background of continuous
and violent upheaval, mountain ranges thrust up and
eroded away, cometary impacts, volcanic
eruptions, oceans rising and falling, whole contine

change ... Even today, the greatest geographical

planet was no longer inhospitable, life would again
spread over the planet. The evolutionary
process would begin again. It might take a few bill

exhaling a lethal gas, and building up its concentr

g. This planet lives and breathes on a much
vaster scale. We can't imagine its slow and powerfu
l rhythms, and we haven't got the humility to
try. We have been residents here for the blink of a
n eye. If we are gone tomorrow, the earth will
not miss us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And we very well might be gone,'' Hammond said, huff
ing.
``Yes,'' Malcolm said. ``We might.''
``So what are you saying? We shouldn't care about th
e environment?''
``No, of course not.''
``Then what?''
Malcolm coughed, and stared into the distance. ``Let
's be clear. The planet is not in jeopardy.
We are in jeopardy. We haven't got the power to des
troy the planet-or to save it. But we might
have the power to save ourselves.''
Under Control
Four hours had passed. It was afternoon; the sun wa
s falling. The air conditioning was back on in
the control room, and the computer was functioning
properly. As near as they could determine,
out of twenty-four people on the island, eight were
dead and six more were missing. The visitor
center and the Safari Lodge were both secure, and t
he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) northern perimeter seemed to be clear of
dinosaurs. They had called authorities in San Jos
for help. The Costa Rican National Guard was
on its way, as well as an air ambulance to carry Ma
lcolm to a hospital. But over the telephone,
the Costa Rican guard had been distinctly cautious-
undoubtedly calls would go back and forth
between San Jos and Washington before help was fin
ally sent to the island. And now it was
growing late in the day- if the helicopters did not
arrive soon, they would have to wait until
morning.
In the meantime, there was nothing to do but wait.
The ship was returning; the crew had
discovered three young raptors scampering about in
one of the aft holds, and had killed the
animals. On Isla Nublar, the immediate danger appea
red to have passed; everyone was in either
the visitor center or the lodge. Tim had gotten qui
te good with the computer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) flashed up a
new screen.

``What the hell is it doing now?'' Gennaro said. ``Now
it says there are fewer animals?''
Grant nodded. ``Probably.''
Ellie said, ``Jurassic Park is finally coming under
control.''
``Meaning what?''
``Equilibrium.'' Grant pointed to the monitors. On on
e of them, the hypsilophodonts leapt into
the air as a pack of velociraptors entered the fiel
d from the west.
``The fences have been down for hours,'' Grant said.
``The animals are mingling with each
other. Populations reaching equilibriums true Juras
sic equilibrium.''
``I don't think it was supposed to happen,'' Gennaro
said. ``The animals were never supposed to
mix.''
``Well, they are.''
On another monitor, Grant saw a pack of raptors rac
ing at full speed across an open field
toward a four-ton hadrosaur. The hadrosaur turned t
o flee, and one of the raptors lumped onto its
back, biting into the long neck, while others raced
forward, circled around it, nipped at its legs,
leapt up to slash at the belly with their powerful
claws. Within minutes, six raptors had brought
down the larger animal.
Grant stared, silently.
Ellie said, ``Is it the way you imagined?''
``I don't know what I imagined,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) watched
the monitor. ``No, not exactly.''
Muldoon said quietly, ``You know, it appears all the
adult raptors are out right now.''
Grant didn't pay much attention at first. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) just w
atched the monitors, the interaction of the
great animals. In the south, the stegosaur was swin
ging its spiked tail, warily circling the baby
tyrannosaur, which watched it, bemused, and occasio
nally lunged forward to nip ineffectually at
the spikes. In the western quadrant, the adult tric
eratopsians were fighting among themselves,
charging and locking horns. One animal already lay
wounded and dying.
Muldoon said, ``We've got about an hour of good dayl
ight left, Dr. Grant. If you want to try and
find that nest.''
``Right,'' Grant said. ``I do.''
``I was thinking,'' Muldoon said, ``that, when the Cos
ta Ricans come, they will probably imagine
this island to be a military problem. Something to
destroy as soon as possible.''
``Damn right,'' Gennaro said.
``They'll bomb it from the air,'' Muldoon said. ``Perh
aps napalm, perhaps nerve gas as well. But
from the air.''
``I hope they do,'' Gennaro said. ``This island is too
dangerous. Every animal on this island must
be destroyed, and the sooner the better.''
Grant said, ``That's not satisfactory.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) got to hi
s feet. ``Let's get started. ''
``I don't think you understand, Alan,'' Gennaro said.
``It's my opinion that this island is too
dangerous. It must be destroyed. Every animal on th
is island must be destroyed, and that's what
the Costa Rican guard will do. I think we should le
ave it in their capable hands. Do you
understand what I'm saying?''
``Perfectly,'' Grant said again.
``Then what's your problem?'' Gennaro said. ``It's a m
ilitary operation. Let them do it.''
Grant's back ached, where the raptor had clawed him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
. ``No,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said. ``We have to take care of
it.''
``Leave it to the experts,'' Gennaro said.
Grant remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) bhd found Gennaro, just six
hours earlier, huddled and terrified in
the cab of a truck in the maintenance building. And
suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) temper and slammed the
lawyer up against the concrete wall. ``Listen, you l
ittle bastard, you have a responsibility to this
situation and you're going to start living up to it
.''
``I am,'' Gennaro said, coughing.
``No, you're not. You've shirked your responsibility
all along, from the very beginning.''
``The hell-''
``You sold investors on an undertaking you didn't fu
lly understand. You were part owner of a
business you failed to supervise. You did not check
the activities of a man whom you knew from
experience to be a liar, and you permitted that man
to screw around with the most dangerous
technology in human history. I'd say you shirked yo
ur responsibility.''
Gennaro coughed again. ``Well, now I'm taking respon
sibility.''
``No,'' Grant said. ``You're still shirking it. And yo
u can't do that any more.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) released
Gennaro, who bent over, gasping for breath. Grant t
urned to Muldoon. ``What have we got for
weapons?''
Muldoon said, ``We've got some control nets, and sho
ck prods.''
``How good are these shock prods?'' Grant said.
``They're like bang sticks for sharks. They have an
explosive capacitor tip, delivers a shock on
contact. High voltage, low amps. Not fatal, but it'
s definitely incapacitating.''
``That's not going to do it,'' Grant said. ``Not in th
e nest.''
``What nest?'' Gennaro said, coughing. ``The raptor ne
st,''
Ellie said.
``The raptor nest?''
Grant was saying, ``Have you got any radio collars?''
``I'm
sure we do,'' Muldoon said.
``Get one. And is there anything else that can be us
ed for defense?''
Muldoon shock his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head.
``Well, get whatever you can.''
Muldoon went away. Grant turned to Gennaro. ``Your i
sland is a mess, Mr. Gennaro. Your
experiment is a mess. It has to be cleaned up. But
you can't do that until you know the extent of
the mess. And that means finding the nests on the i
sland. Especially the raptor nests. They'll be
hidden. We have to find them, and inspect them, and
count the eggs. We have to account for
every animal born on this island. Then we can burn
it down. But first we have a little work to do.''
Ellie was looking at the wall map, which now showed
the animal ranges. Tim was working the
keyboard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) pointed to the map. ``The raptors are
localized in the southern area, down where
the volcanic steam fields are. Maybe they like the
warmth.''
``Is there any place to hide down there?''
``Turns out there is,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said. ``There's massive co
ncrete waterworks, to control flooding in the
southern flatlands. Big underground area. Water and
shade.''
Grant nodded. ``Then that's where they'll be.''
Ellie said, ``I think there's an entrance from the b
each, too.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) turned to the consoles and
said, ``Tim, show us the cutaways on the waterworks.
'' Tim wasn't listening. ``Tim?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) was hunched over the keyboard. ``Just a minute,''
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) said. ``I found something.''
``What is it?''
``It's an unmarked storage room. I don't know what's
there.''
``Then it might have weapons, Grant said.
They were all behind the maintenance building, unlo
cking a steel storm door, lifting it up into the
sunlight, to reveal concrete steps going down into
the earth. <div class="bookquote">``Damned Arnold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said, as

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, Hammond knew. Somebody knew.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where is Hammond now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Still in the lodge.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They reached the bottom of the stairs, and came upo
n rows of gas masks hanging on the wall,
in plastic containers. They shone their flashlights
deeper into the room and saw several heavy
glass cubes, two feet high, with steel caps. Grant
could see small dark spheres inside the cubes. It
was like being in a room full of giant pepper mills
, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) thought.
Muldoon opened the cap of one, reached in, and with
drew a sphere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) turned it in the light,
frowning. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be damned.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
<div class="bookquote">``MORO-12,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``It's an inhalation nerve

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let's get started,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said grimly.
<div class="bookquote">``It likes me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said, smiling. They were standin
g in the garage of the visitor center, by the littl
e
raptor that Grant had captured in the tunnel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) w
as petting the raptor through the cage bars.
The animal rubbed up against her (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``I'd be careful there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``They can giv
e a nasty bite.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) likes me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) name is Clarence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Clarence?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said.
Muldoon was holding the leather collar with the sma
ll metal box attached to it. Grant heard the
high-pitched beeping in the headset. <div class="bookquote">``Is it a probl
em putting the collar on the animal?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex was still petting the raptor, reaching through
the cage. <div class="bookquote">``I het he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>)'ll let me put it on him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
said.
<div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``They're unpredicta

het he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>)'ll let me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) said.
So Muldoon gave Lex the collar, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) held it out
so the raptor could smell it. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>)
slowly slipped it around the animal's neck. The rap
tor turned brighter green when Lex buckled it
and closed the Velcro cover over the buckle. Then t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lex</b></font>) animal relaxed, and turned paler again.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll be damned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. ``It's a

<p/>chameleon,'' Lex said.
``The other raptors couldn't do that,'' Muldoon said,
frowning. ``This wild animal must be
different. By the way,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) said, turning to Grant,
``if they're all born females, how do they breed?
You never explained that bit about the frog DNA.''
``It's not frog DNA,'' Grant said. ``It's amphibian DN
A. But the phenomenon happens to be
particularly well documented in frogs. Especially W
est African frogs, if I remember.''
``What phenomenon is that?''
``Gender transition,'' Grant said. ``Actually, it's ju
st plain changing sex.'' Grant explained that a
number of plants and animals were known to have the
ability to change their sex during life-
orchids, some fish and shrimp, and now frogs. Frogs
that had been observed to lay eggs were
able to change, over a period of months, into compl
ete males. They first adopted the fighting
stance of males, they developed the mating whistle
of males, they stimulated the hormones and
grew the gonads of males, and eventually they succe
ssfully mated with females.
``You're kidding,'' Gennaro said. ``And what makes it
happen?''
``Apparently the change is stimulated by an environm
ent in which all the animals are of the
same sex. In that situation, some of the amphibians
will spontaneously begin to change sex from
female to male.''
``And you think that's what happened to the dinosaur
s?''
``Until we have a better explanation, yes,'' Grant sa
id. ``I think that's what happened. Now, shall
we find this nest?''
They piled into the Jeep, and Lex lifted the raptor
from the cage. The animal seemed quite calm,
almost tame in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) bands. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) gave it a final pat o
n the head, and released it.
The animal wouldn't leave.
``Go on, shoo!'' Lex said. ``Go home!''
The raptor turned, and ran off into the foliage.
Grant held the receiver and wore the headphones. Mu
ldoon drove. The car bounced along the
main road, going south. Gennaro turned to Grant and
said, ``What is it like, this nest?''
``Nobody knows,'' Grant said.
``But I thought you'd dug them up.''
``I've dug up fossil dinosaur nests,'' Grant said. ``B
ut all fossils are distorted by the weight of
millennia. We've made some hypotheses, some supposi
tions, but nobody really knows what the
nests were like.''
Grant listened to the beeps, and signaled Muldoon t
o head farther west. It looked more and
more as if Ellie had been correct: the nest was in
the southern volcanic fields.
Grant shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head. ``Not much about nesting behav
ior is clear,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) found himself
explaining about the modern reptiles, like crocodil
es and alligators. Even their nesting behavior
wasn't well understood. Actually, the American alli
gator was better studied than most, and in the
case of alligators, only the female guarded the nes
t, and only until the time of birth. The male
alligator had spent days in early spring lying besi
de the female in a mating pair, blowing bubbles
on her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) checks and providing her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) with other signs of
masculine attention designed to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) to
receptivity, causing her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) finally to lift her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) tail a
nd allow him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) lay beside her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>), to insert his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
penis. By the time the female built her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) nest, two m
onths later, the male was long gone. And
although the female guarded her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) cone-shaped, three-
foot-high mud nest ferociously, her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)
attention seemed to wane with time, and she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) general
ly abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) eggs by the time the
hatchlings began to squeak and emerge from their sh
ells. Thus, in the wild, a baby alligator
began its life entirely on its own, and for that re
ason its belly was stuffed with egg yolk for
nourishment in its early days.
``So the adult alligators don't protect the young?''
``Not as we imagine it,'' Grant said. ``The biological
parents both abandon the offspring. But
there is a kind of group protection. Young alligato
rs have a very distinctive distress cry, and it
brings any adult who hears it-parent or not-to thei
r assistance with a full-fledged, violent attack.
Not a threat display. A full-on attack.''
``Oh.'' Gennaro fell silent.
``But that's in all respects a distinctly reptile pa
ttern,'' Grant continued. ``For example, the
alligator's biggest problem is to keep the eggs coo
l. The nests are always located in the shade. A
temperature of ninety-eigbt point six degrees will
kill an alligator egg, so the mother mostly
guards her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eggs to keep them cool.''
``And dinos aren't reptiles,'' Muldoon said laconical
ly.
``Exactly. The dinosaur nesting pattern could be muc
h more closely related to that of any of a
variety of birds-''
``So you actually mean you don't know,'' Gennaro said
, getting annoyed. ``You don't know what
the nest is like?''
``No,'' Grant said. ``I don't.''
``Well,'' Gennaro said. ``So much for the damn experts
.''
Grant ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). Already he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could smell the sulfu
r. And up ahead he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw the rising steam of
the volcanic fields.
The ground was hot, Gennaro thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) walked f
orward. It was actually hot. And here and
there mud bubbled and spat up from the ground. And
the reeking, sulfurous steam hissed in
great shoulder-high plumes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) were w
alking through hell.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) looked at Grant, walking along with the headset
on, listening to the beeps. Grant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
cowboy boots and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) jeans and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) Hawaiian shirt,
apparently very cool. Gennaro didn't feel
cool. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) was frightened to be in this stinking, hel
lish place, with the velociraptors somewhere
around. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) didn't understand how Grant could be so
calm about it.
Or the woman. Sattler. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) was walking along, too,
just looking calmly around.
``Doesn't this bother you?'' Gennaro said. ``I mean, w
orry you?''
``We've got to do it,'' Grant said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) didn't say any
thing else.
They all walked forward, among the bubbling steam v
ents. Gennaro fingered the gas grenades
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) had clipped to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) belt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) turned to Ellie
. ``Why isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) worried about it?''
``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) is,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said. ``But he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>)'s also thought abo
ut this for his (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) whole life.''
Gennaro nodded, and wondered what that would be lik
e. Whether there was anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) had
waited his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) whole life for. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) decided there wasn't
anything.
Grant squinted in the sunlight. Ahead, through veil
s of steam, an animal crouched, looking at
them. Then it scampered away.
``Was that the raptor?'' Ellie said.
``I think so. Or another one. juvenile, anyway.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said, ``Leading us on?''
``Maybe.'' Ellie had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) how the raptors had pla
yed at the fence to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) attention while
another climbed onto the roof. If true, such behavi
or implied a mental capacity that was beyond
nearly all forms of life on earth. Classically, the
ability to invent and execute plans was believed t
o
be limited to only three species: chimpanzees, gori
llas, and human beings. Now there was the
possibility that a dinosaur might be able to do suc
h a thing, too.
The raptor appeared again, darting into the light,
then jumping away with a squeak. It really did
seem to be leading them on.
Gennaro frowned. ``How smart are they?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) said.
``If you think of them as birds,'' Grant said, ``then
you have to wonder. Some new studies show
the gray parrot has as much symbolic intelligence a
s a chimpanzee. And chimpanzees can
definitely use language. Now researchers are findin
g that parrots have the emotional
development of a three-year-old child, but their in
telligence is unquestioned. Parrots can
definitely reason symbolically.''
``But I've never heard of anybody killed by a parrot
,'' Gennaro grumbled.
Distantly, they could bear the sound of the surf on
the island shore. The volcanic fields were
behind them now, and they faced a field of boulders
. The little raptor climbed up onto one rock,
and then abruptly disappeared.
``Where'd it go?'' Ellie said.
Grant was listening to the earphones. The beeping s
topped. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>chimpanzees</b></font>)'s gone.''
They hurried forward, and found in the midst of the
rocks a small bole, like a rabbit hole. It was
perhaps two feet in diameter. As they watched, the
juvenile raptor reappeared, blinking in the
light. Then it scampered away.
``No way,'' Gennaro said. ``No way I'm going down ther
e.''
Grant said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) and Ellie began to plug in e
quipment. Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had a small video
camera attached to a hand-held monitor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) tied the
camera to a rope, turned it on, and lowered it
down the hole.
``You can't see anything that way,'' Gennaro said.
``Let it adjust,'' Grant said. There was enough light
along the upper tunnel for them to see
smooth dirt walls, and then the tunnel opened out-s
uddenly, abruptly. Over the microphone, they
heard a squeaking sound. Then a lower, trumpeting s
ound. More noises, coming from many
animals.
``Sounds like the nest, all right,'' Ellie said.
``But you can't see anything,'' Gennaro said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) wipe
d the sweat off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) forehead.
``No,'' Grant said. ``But I can hear. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) listened fo
r a while longer, and then hauled the camera
out, and set it on the ground. ``Let's get started.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) climbed up toward the bole. Ellie went to get
a flashlight and a shock stick. Grant pulled the ga
s mask on over his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) face, and crouched down
awkwardly, extending his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) legs backward.
``You can't be serious about going down there,'' Genn
aro said.
Grant nodded. ``It doesn't thrill me. I'll go first,
then Ellie, then you come after.''
``Now, wait a minute,'' Gennaro said, in sudden alarm
. ``Why don't we drop these nerve-gas
grenades down the hole, then go down afterward? Doe
sn't that make more sense?''
``Ellie, you got the flashlight?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) handed the flashlight to Grant.
``What about it?'' Gennaro said. ``What do you say?''
``I'd like nothing better,'' Grant said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) backed do
wn toward the hole. ``You ever seen anything
die from poison gas?''
``No ...''
<div class="bookquote">``It generally causes convulsions. Bad convulsions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not a little nervous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm scar

 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Follow me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. Ellie handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) a shock s
tick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) pushed backward through the
hole, and grunted. <div class="bookquote">``Tight fit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant exhaled, and extended his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) arms forward in fro
nt of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), and there was a kind of whoosh,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was gone.
The bole gaped, empty and black.
<div class="bookquote">``What happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said, alarmed.
Ellie stepped forward and leaned close to the hole,
listening at the opening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) clicked the
radio, said softly, <div class="bookquote">``Alan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>There was a long silence. Then they heard faintly:
<div class="bookquote">``I'm here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is everything all right, Alan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Another long silence. When Grant finally spoke, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
voice sounded distinctly odd, almost
awestruck.
<div class="bookquote">``Everything's fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said.
Almost Paradigm
In the lodge, John Hammond paced back and forth in
Malcolm's room. Hammond was impatient
and uncomfortable. Since marshaling the effort for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) last outburst, Malcolm had slipped into a
coma, and now it appeared to Hammond that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) might
actually die. Of course a helicopter had
been sent for, but God knows when it would arrive.
The thought that Malcolm might die in the
meantime filled Hammond with anxiety and dread.
And, paradoxically, Hammond found it all much worse
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) disliked the mathematician
so much. It was worse than if the man were his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) frie
nd. Hammond felt that Malcolm's death,
should it occur, would be the final rebuke, and tha
t was more than Hammond could bear.
In any case, the smell in the room was quite ghastl
y. Quite ghastly. The rotten decay of human
flesh.
<div class="bookquote">``Everything ... parad ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said, tossin
g on the pillow. <div class="bookquote">``Is
he (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) waking up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Hammond said. Harding shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) head
.
<div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) say? Something about paradise?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``I

<p/>didn't catch it,'' Harding said.
Hammond paced some more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) pushed the window wider
, trying to get some fresh air.
Finally, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) couldn't stand it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) said, ``Is th
ere any problem about going outside?''
``I don't think so, no,'' Harding said. ``I think this
area is all right.''
``Well, look, I'm going outside for a bit.''
``All right,'' Harding said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) adjusted the flow on
the intravenous antibiotics.
``I'll be back soon.''
<div class="bookquote">``All right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hammond left, stepping out into the daylight, wonde
ring why he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) had bothered to justify himself
to Harding. After all, the man was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) employee. Ha
mmond had no need to explain himself.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went through the gates of the fence, looking aro
und the park. It was late afternoon, the time
when the blowing mist was thinned, and the sun some
times came out. The sun was out now, and
Hammond took it as an omen. Say what they would, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)
knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) park had promise. And
even if that impetuous fool Gennaro decided to burn
it to the ground, it would not make much
difference.
Hammond knew that in two separate vaults at InGen h
eadquarters in Palo Alto were dozens of
frozen embryos. It would not be a problem to grow t
hem again, on another island, elsewhere in
the world. And if there had been problems here, the
n the next time they would solve those
problems. That was how progress occurred. By solvin
g problems.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) thought about it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) concluded that Wu had no
t really been the man for the job. Wu had
obviously been sloppy, too casual with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) great un
dertaking. And Wu had been too preoccupied
with the idea of making improvements. Instead of ma
king dinosaurs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) had wanted to improve
on them. Hammond suspected darkly that was the reas
on for the downfall of the park.
Wu was the reason.
Also, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wu</b></font>) had to admit that John Arnold was ill suit
ed for the job of chief engineer. Arnold had
impressive credentials, but at this point in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) ca
reer he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) was tired, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) was a fretful worrier. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>)

<p/>hadn't been organized, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) had missed things. Im
portant things.
In truth, neither Wu nor Arnold had had the most im
portant characteristic, Hammond decided.
The characteristic of vision. That great sweeping a
ct of imagination which evoked a marvelous
park, where children pressed against the fences, wo
ndering at the extraordinary creatures, come
alive from their storybooks. Real vision. The abili
ty to see the future. The ability to marshal
resources to make that future vision a reality.
No, neither Wu nor Arnold was suited to that task.
And, for that matter, Ed Regis had been a poor choi
ce, too. Harding was at best an indifferent
choice. Muldoon was a drunk....
Hammond shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) would do better next tim
e.
Lost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) headed toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) bungalow
, following the little path that ran north
from the visitor center. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) passed one of the workm
en, who nodded curtly. Hammond did not
return the nod. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) found the Tican workmen to be un
iformly insolent. To tell the truth, the choice
of this island off Costa Rica had also been unwise.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Costa</b></font>) would not make such obvious mistakes
again-
When it came, the roar of the dinosaur seemed frigh
teningly close. Hammond spun so quickly
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) fell on the path, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) looked back he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) tho
ught he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) saw the shadow of the juvenile T-rex,
moving in the foliage beside the flagstone path, mo
ving toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>).
What was the T-rex doing here? Why was it outside t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) fences?
Hammond felt a flash of rage: and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) saw the T
ican workman, running for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) life, and
Hammond took the moment to get to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) feet and dash
blindly into the forest on the opposite side
of the path. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was plunged in darkness- he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) stumble
d and fell, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) face mashed into wet leaves
and damp earth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) staggered back up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) fee
t, ran onward, fell again, and then ran once
more. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was moving down a steep hillside, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) couldn't keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) balance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) tumbled
helplessly, rolling and spinning over the soft grou
nd, before finally coming to a stop at the foot of
the hill. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) face splashed into shallow tepid wate
r, which gurgled around him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) and ran up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)
nose.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was lying face down in a little stream.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) had panicked! What a fool! He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) should have gone t
o his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) bungalow! Hammond cursed
himself. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) feet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) felt a sharp pai
n in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) right ankle that brought tears to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) eyes
.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) tested it gingerly: it might be broken. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) force
d himself to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) full weight on it, gritting hi
s
teeth. Yes.
Almost certainly broken.
In the control room, Lex said to Tim, <div class="bookquote">``I wish they
had taken us with them to the nest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's too dangerous for us, Lex,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said. <div class="bookquote">``We hav
e to stay here. Hey, listen to this one.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
pressed another button, and a recorded tyrannosaur
roar echoed over the loudspeakers in the
park.
<div class="bookquote">``That's neat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. <div class="bookquote">``That's better than the ot
her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) one,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You can do it, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said. <div class="bookquote">``And if you push th
is, you get reverb.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let me try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lex</b></font>)</div>Lex said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) pushed the button. The
tyrannosaur roared again. <div class="bookquote">``Can we make it
last longer?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tim</b></font>)</div>Tim said. <div class="bookquote">``We just twist this thing here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hammond/Hammond Foundation/Foundation</b></font>)</div>Lying at the bottom of the hill, Hammond heard the
tyrannosaur roar, bellowing through the
jungle.
Jesus.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) shivered, hearing that sound. It was terrifying,
a scream from some other world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) waited
to see what would happen. What would the tyrannosau
r do? Had it already gotten that workman?
Hammond waited, hearing only the buzz of the jungle
cicadas, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was holding
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) breath, and let out a long sigh.
With his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) injured ankle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) couldn't climb the hill.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) would have to wait at the bottom of the
ravine. After the tyrannosaur had gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) would ca
ll for help. Meanwhile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was in no danger
here.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) heard an amplified voice say, <div class="bookquote">``Come on, Tim
my, I get to try it too. Come on. Let me
make the noise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The kids!
The tyrannosaur roared again, but this time it had
distinct musical overtones, and a kind of
echo, persisting afterward.
<div class="bookquote">``Neat one,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the little girl. <div class="bookquote">``Do it again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Those kids</b></font>)</div>Those damned kids!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) should never have brought those kids. They had b
een nothing but trouble from the
beginning. Nobody wanted them around-Hammond had on
ly brought them because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) thought it
would stop Gennaro from destroying the resort, but
Gennaro was going to do it anyway. And the
kids had obviously gotten into the control room and
started fooling around-now, who had allowed
that?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) heart begin to race, and felt an uneasy
shortness of breath. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) forced himself to
relax. There was nothing wrong. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) could n
ot climb the hill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) could not be more than a
hundred yards from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) own bungalow, and the visito
r center. Hammond sat down in the damp
earth, listening to the sounds in the jungle around
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>). And then, after a while, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) began to shout
for help.
Malcolm's voice was no louder than a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Ever
ything looks different ... on the other side,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) said.
Harding leaned close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``On the other side?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>H
e thought that Malcolm was talking about
dying.
<div class="bookquote">``When ... shifts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said.
<div class="bookquote">``Shifts?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm didn't answer. His (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) dry lips moved. <div class="bookquote">``Paradig
m,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) said finally.
<div class="bookquote">``Paradigm shifts?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harding/Dr. Harding</b></font>)</div>Harding said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) knew about para
digm shifts. For the last two decades,
they had been the fashionable way to talk about sci
entific change. <div class="bookquote">``Paradigm''  (<font color='red'><b>scientists</b></font>)</div>was just another
word for a model, but as scientists used it the ter
m meant something more, a world view. A larger
way of seeing the world. Paradigm shifts were said
to occur whenever science made a major
change in its view of the world. Such changes were
relatively rare, occurring about once a
century, Darwinian evolution had forced a paradigm
shift. Quantum mechanics had forced a
smaller shift.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said. ``Not ... paradigm ... beyon
d ``Beyond paradigm?'' Harding said.
``Don't care about ... what ... anymore .
Harding sighed. Despite all efforts, Malcolm was ra
pidly slipping into a terminal delirium. His (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>)
fever was higher, and they were almost out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) a
ntibiotics.
<div class="bookquote">``What don't you care about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malcolm/Ian Malcolm</b></font>)</div>Malcolm said. <div class="bookquote">``Because ... everything
looks different ... on the other side.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) smiled.
Descent
<div class="bookquote">``You're crazy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said to Ellie Sattler, watc
hing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) squeezed backward into the rabbit
hole, stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) arms forward. <div class="bookquote">``You're crazy to
do that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Probably,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) reached forwa
rd with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) outstretched hands, and
pushed backward against the sides of the hole. And
suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sattler</b></font>) was gone.
The hole gaped black.
Gennaro began to sweat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) turned to Muldoon, who w
as standing by the Jeep. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not doing
this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, you are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't do this. I can't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They're waiting for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``You have
to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Christ only knows what's down there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said
. <div class="bookquote">``I'm telling you, I can't do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You have to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro turned away, looked at the hole, looked bac
k. <div class="bookquote">``I can't. You can't make me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) held up the stain
less-steel prod. <div class="bookquote">``Ever felt a shock stick?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't do much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``Almost never fata
l. Generally knocks you flat. Perhaps
loosens your bowels. But it doesn't usually have an
y permanent effect. At least, not on dinos. But,
then, people are much smaller.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro looked at the stick. <div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think you'd better go down and count those anima
ls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said. <div class="bookquote">``And you better hurry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro looked back at the hole, at the black openi
ng, a mouth in the earth. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Muldoon</b></font>) looked at
Muldoon, standing there, large and impassive.
Gennaro was sweating and lighthearted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) started w
alking toward the hole. From a distance it
appeared small, but as be came closer it seemed to
grow larger.
<div class="bookquote">``That's it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon said.
Gennaro climbed backward into the hole, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) bega
n to feel too frightened to continue that
way-the idea of backing into the unknown filled him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
with dread-so at the last minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) turned
around and climbed head first into the hole, extend
ing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) arms forward and kicking his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) feet,
because at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) would see where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) was going. H
e pulled the gas mask over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) face.
And suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) was rushing forward, sliding into b
lackness, seeing the dirt walls disappear
into darkness before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>), and then the walls became
narrower-much narrower-terrifyingly
narrow-and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) was lost in the pain of a squeezing c
ompression that became steadily worse and
worse, that crushed the air out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) lungs, and h
e was only dimly aware that the tunnel tilted
slightly upward, along the path, shifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) body,
leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) gasping and seeing spots before
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) eyes, and the pain was extreme.
And then suddenly the tunnel tilted downward again,
and it became wider, and Gennaro felt
rough surfaces, concrete, and cold air. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) body wa
s suddenly free, and bouncing, turning on
concrete.
And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) fell.
Voices in the darkness. Fingers touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>), reach
ing forward from the whispered voices. The
air was cold, like a cave.
<div class="bookquote">''-okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) looks okay, yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``He (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)'s

<p/>breathing...''
``Fine.''
A female hand caressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) face. It was Ellie. ``Ca
n you hear?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) whispered.
``Why is everybody whispering?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) said. ``Because.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) pointed.
Gennaro turned, rolled, got slowly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
stared as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) vision grew accustomed to the
darkness. But the first thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) saw, gleaming
in the darkness, was eyes. Glowing green
eyes.
Dozens of eyes. All around him (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) was on a concrete ledge, a kind of embankment, a
bout seven feet above the floor. Large
steel junction boxes provided a makeshift hiding pl
ace, protecting them from the view of the two
full-size velociraptors that stood directly before
them, not five feet away. The animals were dark
green with brownish tiger stripes. They stood uprig
ht, balancing on their stiff extended tails. They
were totally silent, looking around watchfully with
large dark eyes. At the feet of the adults, baby
velociraptors skittered and chirped. Farther back,
in the darkness, juveniles tumbled and played,
giving short snarls and growls.
Gennaro did not dare to breathe.
Two raptors!
Crouched on the ledge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) was only a foot or two ab
ove the animals head height. The raptors
were edgy, their heads jerking nervously up and dow
n. From time to time they snorted
impatiently. Then they moved off, turning back towa
rd the main group.
As his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) eyes adjusted, Gennaro could now see that th
ey were in some kind of an enormous
underground structure, but it was man-made-there we
re seams of poured concrete, and the nubs
of protruding steel rods. And within this vast echo
ing space were many animals: Gennaro
guessed at least thirty raptors. Perhaps more.
``It's a colony, Grant said, whispering. <div class="bookquote">``Four or si
x adults. The rest juveniles and infants. At
least two hatchings. One last year and one this yea
r. These babies look about four months old.
Probably hatched in April.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the babies</b></font>)</div>One of the babies, curious, scampered up on the led
ge, and came toward them, squeaking. It
was now only ten feet away.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh Jesus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. But immediately one of th
e adults came forward, raised its head,
and gently nudged the baby to turn back. The baby c
hittered a protest, then hopped up to stand
on the snout of the adult. The adult moved slowly,
allowing the baby to climb over its head, down
its neck, onto its back. From that protected spot,
the infant turned, and chirped noisily at the three

<p/>intruders.
The adults still did not seem to notice them at all
.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't get it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Why aren't th
ey attacking?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``They must not see us. And th
ere aren't any eggs at the moment... .
Makes them more relaxed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Relaxed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said. <div class="bookquote">``How long do we have to st
ay here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Long enough to do the count,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
As Grant saw it, there were three nests, attended b
y three sets of parents. The division of territory
was centered roughly around the nests, although the
offspring seemed to overlap, and run into
different territories. The adults were benign with
the young ones, and tougher with the juveniles,
occasionally snapping at the older animals when the
ir play got too rough.
At that moment, a juvenile raptor came up to Ellie
and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head against her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) leg. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
looked down and saw the leather collar with the bla
ck box. It was damp in one place. And it had
chafed the skin of the young animal's neck.
The juvenile whimpered.
In the big room below, one of the adults turned cur
iously toward the sound.
<div class="bookquote">``You think I can take it off?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Just do it quickly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oo-kay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said, squatting beside the small anim
al.. It whimpered again.
The adults snorted, bobbed their heads.
Ellie petted the little juvenile, trying to soothe
it, to silence its whimpering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>)
hands toward the leather collar, lifted back the Ve
lcro tab with a tearing sound. The adults jerked
their heads.
Then one began to walk toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Oh shit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) breath.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't move,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``Stay calm.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The adult walked past them, its long curved toes cl
icking on the concrete. The animal paused
in front of Ellie, who stayed crouched by the juven
ile, behind a steel box. The juvenile was
exposed, and Ellie's hand was still on the collar.
The adult raised its head, and sniffed the air.
The adult's big head was very close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) hand, bu
t it could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) because of the function
box. A tongue flicked out, tentatively.
Grant reached for a gas grenade, plucked it from hi
s belt, held his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) thumb on the pin. Gennaro
put out a restraining hand, shock his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) head, nodded
to Ellie.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) wasn't wearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) mask.
Grant set the grenade down, reached for the shock p
rod. The adult was still very close to Ellie.
Ellie eased the leather strap off. The metal of the
buckle clinked on concrete. The adult's head
jerked fractionally, and then cocked to one side, c
urious. It was moving forward again to
investigate, when the little juvenile squeaked happ
ily and scampered away. The adult remained
by Ellie. Then finally it turned, and walked back t
o the center of the nest.
Gennaro gave a long exhalation. <div class="bookquote">``Jesus. Can we leav
e?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``But I think we can get some work
done now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>In the phosphorescent green glow of the night-visio
n goggles, Grant peered down into the room
from the ledge, looking at the first nest. It was m
ade of mud and straw, formed into a broad,
shallow basket shape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) counted the remains of fou
rteen eggs. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) couldn't count the
actual shells from this distance, and in any case t
hey were long since broken and scattered over
the floor, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was able to count the indentation
s in the mud. Apparently the raptors made their
nests shortly before the eggs were laid, and the eg
gs left a permanent impression in the mud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
also saw evidence that at least one had broken. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
credited thirteen animals.
The second nest had broken in half. But Grant estim
ated it had contained nine eggshells. The
third nest had fifteen eggs, but it appeared that t
hree eggs had been broken early.
<div class="bookquote">``What's that total?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty-four born,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. ``And how

<p/>many do you see?''
Grant shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head. The animals were running all
over the cavernous interior space, darting
in and out of the light.
``I've been watching,'' Ellie said, shining her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) light
down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) notepad. <div class="bookquote">``You'd have to take
photos to be sure, but the snout markings of the in
fants are all different. My count is thirty-three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And juveniles?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Twentyitwo. But, Alan-do you notice anything funny
about them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Like what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant whispered.
<div class="bookquote">``How they arrange themselves spatially. They're fal
ling into some kind of a pattern or
arrangement in the room.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant frowned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said,<div class="bookquote">``It's pretty dark.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, look. Look for yourself. Watch the little ones
. When they are playing, they tumble and run
every which way. But in between, when the babies ar
e standing around, notice how they orient
their bodies. They face either that wall, or the op
posite wall. It's like they line up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, Ellie. You think there's a colony me
tastructure? Like bees?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, not exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's more subtle than
that. It's just a tendency.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the babies do it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. They all do it. The adults do it, too. Watch t
hem. I'm telling you, they line up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant frowned. It seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) was right. The a
nimals engaged in all sorts of behavior, but
during pauses, moments when they were watching or r
elaxing, they seemed to orient themselves
in particular ways, almost as if there were invisib
le lines on the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``Beats me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe there's a breeze. .
. .''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel one, Alan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What are they doing? Some kind of social organizat
ion expressed as spatial structure?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That doesn't make sense,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Because they
all do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro flipped up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``I knew this thing wo
uld come in handy one day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Beneath the
watch face was a compass,
Grant said, <div class="bookquote">``You have much use for that in court?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``My wife gave it to m
e,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``for my birthday.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
peered at the compass. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``they're no
t lined up according to anything... . I guess
they're sort of northeast-southwest, something like
that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Ellie said, <div class="bookquote">``Maybe they're hearing something, turni
ng their heads so they can hear...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Grant frowned.
<div class="bookquote">``Or maybe it's just ritual behavior,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``sp
ecies-specific behavior that serves to identify
them to one another. But maybe it doesn't have any
broader meaning.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Ellie sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Or maybe
they're weird. Maybe dinosaurs are weird. Or maybe
it's a kind of communication.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant was thinking the same thing. Bees could commu
nicate spatially, by doing a kind of
dance. Perhaps dinosaurs could do the same thing.
Gennaro watched them and said, <div class="bookquote">``Why don't they go o
utside?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They're nocturnal,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but it almost seems like they're hiding.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant shrugged. In the next moment, the infants beg
an to squeak and hop excitedly. The
adults watched curiously for a moment. And then, wi
th hoots and cries that echoed in the dark
cavernous space, all the dinosaurs wheeled and ran,
heading down the concrete tunnel, into the
darkness beyond.
Hammond
John Hammond sat down heavily in the damp earth of
the hillside and tried to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) breath.
Dear God, it was hot, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought. Hot and humid. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) were breathing through a
sponge.
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looked down at the streambed, now forty feet bel
ow. It seemed like hours since he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had left
the trickling water and begun to climb the hill. Hi
s ankle was now swollen and dark purple. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
couldn't put any weight on it at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was forced
to hop up the hill on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) other leg, which now
burned with pain from the exertion.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was thirsty. Before leaving the stream behin
d, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had drunk from it, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
knew this was unwise. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt dizzy, and the wo
rld sometimes swirled around him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was
having trouble with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) balance. But he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had
to climb the hill, and get back to the path
above. Hammond thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) had heard footsteps on th
e path several times during the previous
hour, and each time he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) had shouted for help. But so
mehow his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) voice hadn't carried far enough;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) hadn't been rescued. And so, as the afternoon wo
re on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) began to realize that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) would
have to climb the hillside, injured leg or not. And
that was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was doing now.
Those damned kids.
Hammond shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) head, trying to clear it- He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) had
been climbing for more than an hour, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) had gone only a third of the distance up the hil
l. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was tired, panting like an old dog. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)
leg throbbed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was dizzy. Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) knew perf
ectly well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was in no danger-he was
almost within sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) bungalow, for God's sake
-but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) had to admit he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was tired. Sitting on
the hillside, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) didn't really want to mov
e any more.
And why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) be tired? he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was s
eventy-six years old. That was no age to
be climbing around hillsides. Even though Hammond w
as in peak condition for a man his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) age.
Personally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) expected to live to be a hundred. It
was just a matter of taking care of yourself, of
taking care of things as they came up. Certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)
had plenty of reasons to live. Other parks to
build. Other wonders to create-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) heard a squeaking, then a chattering sound. Some
kind of small birds, hopping in the
undergrowth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>)'d been hearing small animals all af
ternoon. There were all kinds of things out
here: rats, possums, snakes.
The squeaking got louder, and small bits of earth r
olled down the hillside past him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>). Something
was coming. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) saw a dark green animal hopping
down the hill toward him-and another-
and another.
Compys, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) thought with a chill.

<p/>Scavengers.
The compys didn't look dangerous. They were about a
s big as chickens, and they moved up
and down with little nervous jerks, like chickens.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) knew they were poisonous. Their bites
had a slow-acting poison that they used to kill cri
ppled animals.
Crippled animals, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) thought, frowning.
The first of the compys perched on the hillside, st
aring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>). It stayed about five feet away,
beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) reach, and just watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>). Others came
down soon after, and they stood in a row.
Watching. They hopped up and down and chittered and
waved their little clawed hands.
<div class="bookquote">``Sboo! Get out!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) said, and threw a rock.
The compys backed away, but only a foot or two. The
y weren't afraid. They seemed to know
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) couldn't hurt them.
Angrily, Hammond tore a branch from a tree and swip
ed at them with it. The compys dodged,
nipped at the leaves, squeaked happily. They seemed
to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was playing a game.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) thought again about the poison. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) remembered th
at one of the animal handlers had been
bitten by a compy in a cage. The handler had said t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) poison was like a narcotic-peaceful,
dreamy. No pain.
You just wanted to go to sleep.
The hell with that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) thought. Hammond picked up a
rock, aimed carefully, and threw it,
striking one compy flat in the chest. The little an
imal shrieked in alarm as it was knocked
backward, and rolled over its tail. The other anima
ls immediately backed away.
Better.
Hammond turned away, and started to climb the hill
once more. Holding branches in both
hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) hopped on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) left leg, feeling the ache
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) thigh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) had not gone more than ten
feet when one of the compys jumped onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) back. H
e flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) arms wildly, knocking the animal
away, but lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) balance and slid back down the h
illside. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) came to a stop, a second compy
sprang forward, and took a tiny nip from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) hand.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) looked with horror, seeing the blood flow
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) fingers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) turned and began to scramble u
p the hillside again.
Another compy lumped onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) shoulder, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) felt
a brief pain as it bit the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) neck.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) shrieked and smacked the animal away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) turned
to face the animals, breathing hard, and
they stood all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>), hopping up and down and
cocking their heads, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>). From the
bite on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) neck, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) felt warmth flow through his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) s
houlders, down his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) spine.
Lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) back on the hillside, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) began to feel
strangely relaxed, detached from himself.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) realized that nothing was wrong. No error ha
d been made. Malcolm was quite incorrect in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Malcolm</b></font>) analysis. Hammond lay very still, as still as a
child in its crib, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) felt wonderfully peacefu
l.
When the next compy came up and bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) ankle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) m
ade only a halfhearted effort to kick it
away. The little animals edged closer. Soon they we
re chattering all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>), like excited
birds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) head as another compy jumped o
nto his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) chest, the animal surprisingly light
and delicate. Hammond felt only a slight pain, very
slight, as the compy bent to chew his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) neck.
The Beach
Chasing the dinosaurs, following the curves and slo
pes of concrete, Grant suddenly burst out
through a cavernous opening, and found himself stan
ding on the beach, looking at the Pacific
Ocean. All around him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), the young velociraptors were
scampering and kicking in the sand. But,
one by one, the animals moved back into the shade o
f the palm trees at the edge of the
mangrove swamp, and there they stood, lined up in t
heir peculiar fashion, watching the ocean.
They stared fixedly to the south.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't get it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't, either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said, <div class="bookquote">``except that they cl
early don't like the sun.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>It wasn't very sunny on
the beach; a light mist blew, and the ocean was haz
y. But why had they suddenly left the nest?
What had brought the entire colony to the beach?
Gennaro flipped up the dial on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) watch, and looke
d at the way the animals were standing.
<div class="bookquote">``Northeast-soutbwest. Same as before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Behind the beach, deeper in the woods, they heard t
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) hum of the electric fence. <div class="bookquote">``At least we
know how they get outside the fence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said.
Then they heard the throb of marine diesels, and th
rough the mist they saw a ship appearing in
the south. A large freighter, it slowly moved north
.
<div class="bookquote">``So that's why they came out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
Grant nodded. <div class="bookquote">``They must have heard it coming,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>As the freighter passed, all the animals watched it
, standing silent except for the occasional
chirp or squeak. Grant was struck by the coordinati
on of their behavior, the way they moved and
acted as a group. But perhaps it was not really so
mysterious. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) reviewed the
sequence of events that had begun in the cave.
First the infants had been agitated. Then the adult
s had noticed. And finally all the animals had
stampeded to the beach. That sequence seemed to imp
ly that the younger animals, with keener
bearing, had detected the boat first. Then the adul
ts had led the troop out onto the beach. And as
Grant looked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw that the adults were in charge
now. There was a clear spatial organization
along the beach, and as the animals settled down, i
t was not loose and shifting, the way it had
been inside. Rather, it was quite regular, almost r
egimented. The adults were spaced every ten
yards or so, each adult surrounded by a cluster of
infants. The juveniles were positioned
between, and slightly ahead of, the adults.
But Grant also saw that all the adults were not equ
al.. There was a female with a distinctive
stripe along her (<font color='blue'><b>adults</b></font>) head, and she (<font color='blue'><b>adults</b></font>) was in the very cent
er of the group as it ranged along the beach.
That same female had stayed in the center of the ne
sting area, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) guessed that, like certain
monkey troops, the raptors were organized around a
matriarchal pecking order, and that this
striped animal was the alpha female of the colony.
The males, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) saw, were arranged
defensively at the perimeter of the group.
But unlike monkeys, which were loosely and flexibly
organized, the dinosaurs settled into a
rigid arrangement-almost a military formation, it s
eemed. Then, too, there was the oddity of the
northeast-southwest spatial orientation. That was b
eyond Grant. But, in another sense, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was
not surprised. Paleontologists had been digging up
bones for so long that they had forgotten how
little information could be gleaned from a skeleton
. Bones might tell you something about the
gross appearance of an animal, its height and weigh
t. They might tell you something about how
the muscles attached, and therefore something about
the crude behavior of the animal during life.
They might give you clues to the few diseases that
affected bone. But a skeleton was a poor
thing, really, from which to try and deduce the tot
al behavior of an organism.
Since bones were all the paleontologists had, bones
were what they used. Like other
paleontologists, Grant had become very expert at wo
rking with bones. And somewhere along the
way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had started to forget the unprovable possib
ilities-that the dinosaurs might be truly
different animals, that they might possess behavior
and social life organized along lines that were
utterly mysterious to their later, mammalian descen
dants. That, since the dinosaurs were
fundamentally birds-
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, my God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) stared at the raptors, ranged along the beach in
a rigid formation, silently watching the
boat. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) suddenly understood what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was lookin
g at.
<div class="bookquote">``Those animals,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``t
hey sure are desperate to escape from
here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``They don't want to escape at all
.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They don't?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``They want to migrate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Approaching Dark
<div class="bookquote">``Migrating!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div>Ellie said. <div class="bookquote">``That's fantastic!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was grinning.
Ellie said, <div class="bookquote">``Where do you suppose they want to go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ellie/Ellie Sattler/Sattler</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said, and then the big helico
pters burst through the fog, thundering and
wheeling over the landscape, their underbellies hea
vy with armament. The raptors scattered in
alarm as one of the helicopters circled back, follo
wing the line of the surf, and then moved in to
land on the beach. A door was flung open and soldie
rs in olive uniforms came running toward
them. Grant heard the rapid babble of voices in Spa
nish and saw that Muldoon was already
aboard with the kids. One of the soldiers said in E
nglish, <div class="bookquote">``Please, you will come with us. Please,
there is no time here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the soldiers</b></font>)</div>Grant looked back at the beach where the raptors ha
d been, but they were gone. All the
animals had vanished. It was as if they had never e
xisted. The soldiers were tugging at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) allowed himself to be led beneath the thumping b
lades and climbed up through the big door.
Muldoon leaned over and shouted in Grant's ear, <div class="bookquote">``Th
ey want us out of here now. They're going to
do it now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>The soldiers pushed Grant and Ellie and Gennaro int
o seats, and helped them clip on the
harnesses. Tim and Lex waved to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) suddenly
saw how young they were, and how
exhausted. Lex was yawning, leaning against her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) bro
ther's shoulder.
An officer came toward Grant and shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Seor: a
re you in charge?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not in charge.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who is in charge, please?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The officer</b></font>)</div>The officer went on to Gennaro, and asked the same
question: <div class="bookquote">``Are you in charge?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gennaro/Donald/Donald Gennaro</b></font>)</div>Gennaro said.
The officer looked at Ellie, but said nothing to he (<font color='blue'><b>Gennaro</b></font>)
r. The door was left open as the helicopter
lifted away from the beach, and Grant leaned out to
see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could catch a last look at the
raptors, but then the helicopter was above the palm
trees, moving north over the island.
Grant leaned to Muldoon, and shouted: <div class="bookquote">``What about t
he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) others?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div>Muldoon shouted, <div class="bookquote">``They've already taken off Harding
and some workmen. Hammond had an
accident. Found him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) on the hill near his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) bungalow.
Must have fallen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Muldoon/Robert Muldoon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
<div class="bookquote">``No. Compys got him (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What about Malcolm?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.

<p/>Muldoon shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head.
Grant was too tired to feel much of anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) tu
rned away, and looked back out the door. It
was getting dark now, and in the fading light he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) co
uld barely see the little rex, with bloody jaws,
crouched over a hadrosaur by the edge of the lagoon
and looking up at the helicopter and roaring
as it passed by.
Somewhere behind them they heard explosions, and th
en ahead they saw another helicopter
wheeling through the mist over the visitor center,
and a moment later the building burst in a bright
orange fireball, and Lex began to cry, and Ellie pu
t her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) arm around her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) and tried to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) not to
look.
Grant was staring down at the ground, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had a
last glimpse of the hypsilophodonts,
leaping gracefully as gazelles, moments before anot
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellie</b></font>) explosion flared bright beneath them.
Their helicopter gained altitude, and then moved ca
st, out over the ocean.
Grant sat back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) seat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) thought of the dinos
aurs standing on the beach, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
wondered where they would migrate if they could, an
d he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) would never know, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
felt sad and relieved in the same moment.
The officer came forward again, bending close to hi
s face. <div class="bookquote">``Are you in charge?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
<div class="bookquote">``Please, seor, who is in charge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said.
The helicopter gained speed as it headed toward the
mainland. It was cold now, and the
soldiers muscled the door closed. As they did, Gran
t looked back just once, and saw the island
against a deep purple sky and sea, cloaked in a dee
p mist that blurred the white-hot explosions
that burst rapidly, one after another, until it see
med the entire island was glowing, a diminishing
bright spot in the darkening night.
Epilogue:
San Jos
Days went by. The government was polite, and put th
em up in a nice hotel in San Jos. They
were free to come and go, and to call whomever they
wished. But they were not permitted to
leave the country. Each day a young man from the Am
erican Embassy came to visit them, to ask
if they needed anything, and to explain that Washin
gton was doing everything it could to hasten
their departure. But the plain fact was that many p
eople had died in a territorial possession of
Costa Rica. The plain fact was that an ecological d
isaster had been narrowly averted. The
government of Costa Rica felt it had been misled an
d deceived by John Hammond and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) plans
for the island. Under the circumstances, the govern
ment was not disposed to release survivors in a
hurry. They did not even permit the burial of Hammo
nd or Ian Malcolm. They simply waited.
Each day it seemed to Grant he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was taken to another
government office, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was
questioned by another courteous, intelligent govern
ment officer. They made him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) go over his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
story, again and again. How Grant had met John Hamm
ond. What Grant knew of the project.
How Grant had received the fax from New York. Why G
rant had gone to the island. What had
happened at the island.
The same details, again and again, day after day. T
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) same story.
For a long time, Grant thought they must believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
was lying to them, and that there was
something they wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) to tell, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) coul
d not imagine what it was. Yet, in some odd
way, they seemed to be waiting.
Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was sitting around the swimming pool of
the hotel one afternoon, watching Tim and
Lex splash, when an American in khakis walked up.
<div class="bookquote">``We've never met,''  (<font color='red'><b>the American</b></font>)</div>the American said. <div class="bookquote">``My name is M
arty Guitierrez. I'm a researcher here, at
the Carara station.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>Grant said, <div class="bookquote">``You were the one who found the origina
l specimen of the Procompsognathus''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grant/Alan/Alan Grant</b></font>)</div>That's right, yes.'' Guitierrez sat next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). ``Yo
u must be eager to go home.''
``Yes,'' Grant said. ``I have only a few days left to
dig before the winter sets in. In Montana, you
know, the first snow usually comes in August.''
Guitierrez said, ``Is that why the Hammond Foundatio
n supported northern digs? Because
intact genetic material from dinosaurs was more lik
ely to be recovered from cold climates?''
``That's what I presume, yes.''
Guitierrez nodded. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) was a clever man, Mr. Hammon
d.''
Grant said nothing. Guitierrez sat back in the pool
chair.
``The authorities won't tell you,'' Guitierrez said f
inally. ``Because they are afraid, and perhaps
also resentful of you, for what you have done. But
something very peculiar is happening in the
rural regions.''
``Biting the babies?''
``No, thankfully, that has stopped. But something el
se. This spring, in the Ismaloya section,
which is to the north, some unknown animals ate the
crops in a very peculiar manner. They
moved each day, in a straight line-almost as straig
ht as an arrow-from the coast, into the
mountains, into the jungle.''
Grant sat upright.
``Like a migration,'' Guitierrez said. ``Wouldn't you
say?''
``What crops?'' Grant said.
``Well, it was odd. They would only eat agama beans
and soy, and sometimes chickens.''
Grant said, ``Foods rich in lysine. What happened to
these animals?''
``Presumably,'' Guitierrez said, ``they entered the ju
ngles. In any case, they have not been
found. Of course, it would be difficult to search f
or them in the jungle. A search party could spend
years in the Ismaloya mountains, with nothing to sh
ow for it.''
``And we are being kept here because ...''
Guitierrez shrugged. ``The government is worried. Pe
rhaps there are more animals. More
trouble. They are feeling cautious.''
``Do you think there are more animals?'' Grant said.
``I can't say. Can you?''
``No,'' Grant said. ``I can't say.''
``But you suspect?''
Grant nodded. ``Possibly there are. Yes.''
``I agree.''
Guitierrez pushed up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) waved to Ti
m and Lex, playing in the pool. ``Probably
they will send the children home,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said. ``There
is no reason not to do that.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
sunglasses. ``Enjoy your stay with us, Dr. Grant. It
is a lovely country here.''
Grant said, ``You're telling me we're not going anyw
here?''
<div class="bookquote">``None of us is going anywhere, Dr. Grant,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Guitierr
ez said, smiling. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) turned, and
walked back toward the entrance of the hotel.
