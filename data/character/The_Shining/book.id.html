JOB INTERVIEW
Jack Torrance thought: Officious little prick.
Ullman stood five-five, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) moved, it was with the prissy speed that
seems to be the exclusive domain of all small plump men. The part in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) hair
was exact, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) dark suit was sober but comforting. I am a man you can bring
your problems to, that suit said to the paying customer. To the hired help it

<p/>spoke more curtly: This had better be good, you. There was a red carnation in
the lapel, perhaps so that no one on the street would mistake Stuart Ullman for
the local undertaker.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) listened to Ullman speak, Jack admitted to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) probably
could not have liked any man on that side of the desk -- under the circumstances.
Ullman had asked a question he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) hadn't caught. That was bad; Ullman was the
type of man who would file such lapses away in a mental Rolodex for later
consideration.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I asked if your wife fully understood what you would be taking on here. And
there's your son, of course.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) glanced down at the application in front of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Daniel. Your wife isn't a bit intimidated by the idea?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wendy is an extraordinary woman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And your son is also extraordinary?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack smiled, a big wide PR smile. <div class="bookquote">``We like to think so, I suppose. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s quite
self-reliant for a five-year-old.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>No returning smile from Ullman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) slipped Jack's application back into the
file. The file went into a drawer. The desk top was now completely bare except
for a blotter, a telephone, a Tensor lamp, and an in/out basket. Both sides of
the in/out were empty, too.
Ullman stood up and went to the file cabinet in the corner. <div class="bookquote">``Step around the
desk, if you will, Mr. Torrance. We'll look at the floor plans.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) brought back five large sheets and set them down on the glossy walnut plain
of the desk. Jack stood by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shoulder, very much aware of the scent of
Ullman's cologne. All my men wear English Leather or they wear nothing at all
came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) mind for no reason at all, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had to clamp his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) tongue between
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) teeth to keep in a bray of laughter. Beyond the wall, faintly, came the
sounds of the Overlook Hotel's kitchen, gearing down from lunch.
<div class="bookquote">``Top floor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman said briskly. <div class="bookquote">``The attic. Absolutely nothing up there now
but bric-a-brac. The Overlook has changed hands several times since World War II
and it seems that each successive manager has put everything they don't want up
in the attic. I want rattraps and poison bait sowed around in it. Some of the
third-floor chambermaids say they have heard rustling noises. I don't believe
it, not for a moment, but there mustn't even be that one-in-a-hundred chance
that a single rat inhabits the Overlook Hotel.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack, who suspected that every hotel in the world had a rat or two, held his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)
tongue.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course you wouldn't allow your son up in the attic under any
circumstances.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said, and flashed the big PR smile again. Humiliating situation.
Did this officious little prick actually think he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would allow his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) son to goof
around in a rattrap attic full of junk furniture and God knew what else?
Ullman whisked away the attic floor plan and put it on the bottom of the pile.
<div class="bookquote">``The Overlook has one hundred and ten guest quarters,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) said in a scholarly
voice. <div class="bookquote">``Thirty of them, all suites, are here on the third floor. Ten in the west
wing -LRB-including the Presidential Suite-RRB-, ten in the center, ten more in the east
wing. All of them command magnificent views.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Could you at least spare the salestalk?

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) kept quiet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) needed the job.
Ullman put the third floor on the bottom of the pile and they studied the
second floor.
<div class="bookquote">``Forty rooms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman said, <div class="bookquote">``thirty doubles and ten singles. And on the first
floor, twenty of each. Plus three linen closets on each floor, and a storeroom
which is at the extreme east end of the hotel on the second floor and the
extreme west end on the first. Questions?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Jack shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) head. Ullman whisked the second and first floors away.
<div class="bookquote">``Now. Lobby level: Here in the center is the registration desk. Behind it are
the offices. The lobby runs for eighty feet in either direction from the desk.
Over here in the west wing is the Overlook Dining Room and the Colorado Lounge.
The banquet and ballroom facility is in the east wing. Questions?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only about the basement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``For the winter caretaker, that's the
most important level of all. Where the action is, so to speak.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Watson will show you all that. The basement floor plan is on the boiler room
wall.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) frowned impressively, perhaps to show that as manager, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did not
concern himself with such mundane aspects of the Overlook's operation as the
boiler and the plumbing. <div class="bookquote">``Might not be a bad idea to put some traps down there
too. Just a minute...''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) scrawled a note on a pad he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) took from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) inner coat pocket -LRB-each sheet
bore the legend From the Desk of Stuart Ullman in bold black script-RRB-, tore it
off, and dropped it into the out basket. It sat there looking lonesome. The pad
disappeared back into Ullman's jacket pocket like the conclusion of a magician's
trick. Now you see it, Jacky-boy, now you don't. This guy is a real heavyweight.
They had resumed their original positions, Ullman behind the desk and Jack in
front of it, interviewer and interviewee, supplicant and reluctant patron.
Ullman folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) neat little hands on the desk blotter and looked directly at
Jack, a small, balding man in a banker's suit and a quiet gray tie. The flower
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) lapel was balanced off by a small lapel pin on the other side. It read
simply STAFF in small gold letters.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Torrance. Albert Shockley is a powerful
man with a large interest in the Overlook, which showed a profit this season for
the first time in its history. Mr. Shockley also sits on the Board of Directors,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) is not a hotel man and he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) would be the first to admit this. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) has
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) wishes in this caretaking matter quite obvious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) wants you hired. I
will do so. But if I had been given a free hand in this matter, I would not have
taken you on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack's hands were clenched tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) lap, working against each other,
sweating. Officious little prick, officious
<div class="bookquote">``I don't believe you care much for me, Mr. Torrance. I
little prick, officious --
don't care. Certainly your feelings toward me play no part in my own belief
that you are not right for the job. During the season that runs from May
fifteenth to September thirtieth, the Overlook employs one hundred and ten
people full-time; one for every room in the hotel, you might say. I don't think
many of them like me and I suspect that some of them think I'm a bit of a
bastard. They would be correct in their judgment of my character. I have to be a
bit of a bastard to run this hotel in the manner it deserves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) looked at Jack for comment, and Jack flashed the PR smile again, large and
insultingly toothy.
Ullman said: <div class="bookquote">``The Overlook was built in the years 1907 to 1909. The closest
town is Sidewinder, forty miles east of here over roads that are closed from
sometime in late October or November until sometime in April. A man named Robert
Townley Watson built it, the grandfather of our present maintenance man.
Vanderbilts have stayed here, and Rockefellers, and Astors, and Du Pouts. Four
Presidents have stayed in the Presidential Suite. Wilson, Harding, Roosevelt,
and Nixon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't be too proud of Harding and Nixon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack murmured.
Ullman frowned but went on regardless. <div class="bookquote">``It proved too much for Mr. Watson, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) sold the hotel in 1915. It was sold again in 1922, in 1929, in 1936. It stood
vacant until the end of World War II, when it was purchased and completely
renovated by Horace Derwent, millionaire inventor, pilot, film producer, and
entrepreneur.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know the name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes. Everything he (<font color='blue'><b>entrepreneur</b></font>) touched seemed to turn to gold ... except the Overlook.
He (<font color='blue'><b>entrepreneur</b></font>) funneled over a million dollars into it before the first postwar guest ever
stepped through its doors, turning a decrepit relic into a showplace. It was
Derwent who added the roque court I saw you admiring when you arrived.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Roque?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A British forebear of our croquet, Mr. Torrance. Croquet is bastardized
roque. According to legend, Derwent learned the game from his (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) social secretary
and fell completely in love with it. Ours may be the finest roque court in
America.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't doubt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said gravely. A roque court, a topiary full of
hedge animals out front, what next? A life-sized Uncle Wiggly game behind the
equipment shed? He (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) was getting very tired of Mr. Stuart Ullman, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) could see
that Ullman wasn't done. Ullman was going to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) say, every last word of
it.
``When he (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) had lost three million, Derwent sold it to a group of California
investors. Their experience with the Overlook was equally bad. Just not hotel
people.
``In 1970, Mr. Shockley and a group of his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) associates bought the hotel and
turned its management over to me. We have also run in the red for several years,
but I'm happy to say that the trust of the present owners in me has never
wavered. Last year we broke even. And this year the Overlook's accounts were
written in black ink for the first time in almost seven decades.''
Jack supposed that this fussy little man's pride was justified, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
original dislike washed over him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) again in a wave.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said: ``I see no connection between the Overlook's admittedly colorful
history and your feeling that I'm wrong for the post, Mr. Ullman.''
``One reason that the Overlook has lost so much money lies in the depreciation
that occurs each winter. It shortens the profit margin a great deal more than
you might believe, Mr. Torrance. The winters are fantastically cruel. In order
to cope with the problem, I've installed a full-time winter caretaker to run the
boiler and to heat different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis. To
repair breakage as it occurs and to do repairs, so the elements can't get a

<p/>foothold. To be constantly alert to any and every contingency. During our first
winter I hired a family instead of a single man. There was a tragedy. A horrible
tragedy.''
Ullman looked at Jack coolly and appraisingly.
``I made a mistake. I admit it freely. The man was a drunk.''
Jack felt a slow, hot grin -- the total antithesis of the toothy PR grin --
stretch across his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mouth. ``Is that it? I'm surprised Al didn't tell you. I've
retired.''
``Yes, Mr. Shockley told me you no longer drink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) also told me about your
last job ... your last position of trust, shall we say? You were teaching
English in a Vermont prep school. You lost your temper, I don't believe I need
to be any more specific than that. But I do happen to believe that Grady's case
has a bearing, and that is why I have brought the matter of your ... uh,
previous history into the conversation. During the winter of 1970-71, after we
had refurbished the Overlook but before our first season, I hired this... this
unfortunate named Delbert Grady. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) moved into the quarters you and your wife
and son will be sharing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) had a wife and two daughters. I had reservations,
the main ones being the harshness of the winter season and the fact that the
Gradys would be cut off from the outside world for five to six months.''
``But that's not really true, is it? There are telephones here, and probably a
citizen's band radio as well. And the Rocky Mountain National Park is within
helicopter range and surely a piece of ground that big must have a chopper or
two.''
``I wouldn't know about that,'' Ullman said. ``The hotel does have a two-way
radio that Mr. Watson will show you, along with a list of the correct
frequencies to broadcast on if you need help. The telephone lines between here
and Sidewinder are still aboveground, and they go down almost every winter at
some point or other and are apt to stay down for three weeks to a month and a
half. There is a snowmobile in the equipment shed also.''
``Then the place really isn't cut off.''
Mr. Ullman looked pained. ``Suppose your son or your wife tripped on the stairs
and fractured his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) skull, Mr. Torrance. Would you think the place was cut
off then?''
Jack saw the point. A snowmobile running at top speed could get you down to
Sidewinder in an hour and a half ... maybe. A helicopter from the Parks Rescue
Service could get up here in three hours ... under optimum conditions. In a
blizzard it would never even be able to lift off and you couldn't hope to run a
snowmobile at top speed, even if you dared take a seriously injured person out
into temperatures that might be twenty-five below-or forty-five below, if you
added in the wind chill factor.
``In the case of Grady,'' Ullman said, ``I reasoned much as Mr. Shockley seems to
have done in your case. Solitude can be damaging in itself. Better for the man
to have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). If there was trouble, I thought, the odds were very
high that it would be something less urgent than a fractured skull or an
accident with one of the power tools or some sort of convulsion. A serious case
of the flu, pneumonia, a broken arm, even appendicitis. Any of those things
would have left enough time.
``I suspect that what happened came as a result of too much cheap whiskey, of

<p/>which Grady had laid in a generous supply, unbeknownst to me, and a curious
condition which the old-timers call cabin fever. Do you know the term?'' Ullman
offered a patronizing little smile, ready to explain as soon as Jack admitted
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ignorance, and Jack was happy to respond quickly and crisply.
``It's a slang term for the claustrophobic reaction that can occur when people
are shut in together over long periods of time. The feeling of claustrophobia is
externalized as dislike for the people you happen to be shut in with. In extreme
cases it can result in hallucinations and violence -- murder has been done over
such minor things as a burned meal or an argument about whose turn it is to do
the dishes.''
Ullman looked rather nonplussed, which did Jack a world of good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) decided to
press a little further, but silently promised Wendy he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) would stay cool.
``I suspect you did make a mistake at that. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) hurt them?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) killed them, Mr. Torrance, and then committed suicide. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) murdered the
little girls with a hatchet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) wife with a shotgun, and himself the same way.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) leg was broken. Undoubtedly so drunk he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) fell downstairs.''
Ullman spread his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) hands and looked at Jack self-righteously.
``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) a high school graduate?''
``As a matter of fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) wasn't,'' Ullman said a little stiffly. ``I thought a,
shall we say, less imaginative individual would be less susceptible to the
rigors, the loneliness -- ''
``That was your mistake,'' Jack said. ``A stupid man is more prone to cabin fever
just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s more prone to shoot someone over a card game or commit a spur-ofthe-moment robbery. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets bored. When the snow comes, there's nothing to do
but watch TV or play solitaire and cheat when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't get all the aces out.
Nothing to do but bitch at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and nag at the kids and drink. It gets hard
to sleep because there's nothing to hear. So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drinks himself to sleep and
wakes up with a hangover. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets edgy. And maybe the telephone goes out and the
TV aerial blows down and there's nothing to do but think and cheat at solitaire
and get edgier and edgier. Finally... boom, boom, boom.''
``Whereas a more educated man, such as yourself?''
``My wife and I both like to read. I have a play to work on, as Al Shockley
probably told you. Danny has his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) puzzles, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) coloring books, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) crystal
radio. I plan to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) to read, and I also want to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) to snowshoe.
Wendy would like to learn how, too. Oh yes, I think we can keep busy and out of
each other's hair if the TV goes on the fritz.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) paused. ``And Al was telling
the truth when he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) told you I no longer drink. I did once, and it got to be
serious. But I haven't had so much as a glass of beer in the last fourteen
months. I don't intend to bring any alcohol up here, and I don't think there
will be an opportunity to get arty after the snow flies.''
``In that you would be quite correct,'' Ullman said. ``But as long as the three
of you are up here, the potential for problems is multiplied. I have told Mr.
Shockley this, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) would take the responsibility. Now I've told
you, and apparently you are also willing to take the responsibility -- ''
``I am.''
``All right. I'll accept that, since I have little choice. But I would still
rather have an unattached college boy taking a year off. Well, perhaps you'll
do. Now I'll turn you over to Mr. Watson, who will take you through the basement

<p/>and around the grounds. Unless you have further questions?''
``No. None at all.''
Ullman stood. ``I hope there are no hard feelings, Mr. Torrance. There is
nothing personal in the things I have said to you. I only want what's best for
the Overlook. It is a great hotel. I want it to stay that way.''
<div class="bookquote">``No. No hard feelings.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Jack flashed the PR grin again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was glad Ullman
didn't offer to shake hands. There were hard feelings. All kinds of them.

BOULDER
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked out the kitchen window and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) just sitting there on the curb,
not playing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) trucks or the wagon or even the balsa glider that had
pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) so much all the last week since Jack had brought it home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was
just sitting there, watching for their shopworn VW, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) elbows planted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
thighs and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) chin propped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands, a five-year-old kid waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
daddy.
Wendy suddenly felt bad, almost crying bad.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hung the dish towel over the bar by the sink and went downstairs,
buttoning the top two buttons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) house dress. Jack and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pride! Hey no,
Al, I don't need an advance. I'm okay for a while. The hallway walls were gouged
and marked with crayons, grease pencil, spray paint. The stairs were steep and
splintery. The whole building smelled of sour age, and what sort of place was
this for Danny after the small neat brick house in Stovington? The people living
above them on the third floor weren't married, and while that didn't bother her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>),
their constant, rancorous fighting did. It scared her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). The guy up there was Tom,
and after the bars had closed and they had returned home, the fights would start
in earnest -- the rest of the week was just a prelim in comparison. The Friday
Night Fights, Jack called them, but it wasn't funny. The woman -- her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name was
Elaine -- would at last be reduced to tears and to repeating over and over again:
<div class="bookquote">``Don't, Tom. Please don't. Please don't.''  (<font color='red'><b>name Elaine</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would shout at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elaine</b></font>). Once they
had even awakened Danny, and Danny slept like a corpse. The next morning Jack
caught Tom going out and had spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) on the sidewalk at some length. Tom
started to bluster and Jack had said something else to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), too quietly for
Wendy to hear, and Tom had only shaken his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head sullenly and walked away. That
had been a week ago and for a few days things had been better, but since the
weekend things had been working back to normal -- excuse me, abnormal. It was bad
for the boy.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sense of grief washed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) again but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was on the walk now and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
smothered it. Sweeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) dress under her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and sitting down on the curb beside
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``What's up, doc?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) but it was perfunctory. <div class="bookquote">``Hi, Mom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The glider was between his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sneakered feet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw that one of the wings
had started to splinter.
<div class="bookquote">``Want me to see what I can do with that, honey?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny had gone back to staring up the street. <div class="bookquote">``No. Dad will fix it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your daddy may not be back until suppertime, doc. It's a long drive up into
those mountains.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you think the bug will break down?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't think so.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had just given her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) something new to worry
about. Thanks, Danny. I needed that.
<div class="bookquote">``Dad said it might,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said in a matter-of-fact, almost bored manner. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)
said the fuel pump was all shot to shit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't say that, Danny.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fuel pump?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) with honest surprise.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``No, `All shot to shit.' Don't say that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's vulgar.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's vulgar, Mom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Like when you pick your nose at the table or pee with the bathroom door open.
Or saying things like `All shot to shit.' Shit is a vulgar word. Nice people
don't say it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dad says it. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) was looking at the bugmotor he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) said, `Christ this fuel
pump's all shot to sbit.' Isn't Dad nice?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Winnifred</b></font>)</div>How do you get into these things, Winnifred? Do you practice?
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'s nice, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'s also a grown-up. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'s very careful not to say things
like that in front of people who wouldn't understand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You mean like Uncle Al?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can I say it when I'm grown-up?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you will, whether I like it or not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How old?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How does twenty sound, doc?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's a long time to have to wait.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I guess it is, but will you try?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hokay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went back to staring up the street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) flexed a little, as if to rise, but
the beetle coming was much newer, and much brighter red. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) relaxed again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>)
wondered just how hard this move to Colorado had been on Danny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was
closemouthed about it, but it bothered her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) spending so much time by
himself. In Vermont three of Jack's fellow faculty members had had children
about Danny's age -- and there had been the preschool -- but in this neighborhood
there was no one for him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) to play with. Most of the apartments were occupied by
students attending CU, and of the few married couples here on Arapahoe Street,
only a tiny percentage had children. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) had spotted perhaps a dozen of high
school or junior high school age, three infants, and that was all.
<div class="bookquote">``Mommy, why did Daddy lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) job?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) was jolted out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) reverie and floundering for an answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) and Jack
had discussed ways they might handle just such a question from Danny, ways that

<p/>had varied from evasion to the plain truth with no varnish on it. But Danny had
never asked. Not until now, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) was feeling low and least prepared for such
a question. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>), maybe reading the confusion on her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) face
and forming his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) own ideas about that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) thought that to children adult motives
and actions must seem as bulking and ominous as dangerous animals seen in the
shadows of a dark forest. They were jerked about like puppets, having only the
vaguest notions why. The thought brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) dangerously close to tears again,
and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) fought them off she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) leaned over, picked up the disabled glider,
and turned it over in her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) hands.
<div class="bookquote">``Your daddy was coaching the debate team, Danny. Do you remember that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Arguments for fun, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) turned the glider over and over, looking at the trade name
-LRB-SPEEDOGLIDE-RRB- and the blue star decals on the wings, and found herself telling
the exact truth to her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) son.
<div class="bookquote">``There was a boy named George Hatfield that Daddy had to cut from the team.
That means he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) wasn't as good as some of the others. George said your daddy cut
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) didn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and not because he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wasn't good enough. Then
George did a bad thing. I think you know about that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) the one who put the holes in our bug's tires?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was. It was after school and your daddy caught him (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) doing it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>)
hesitated again, but there was no question of evasion now; it was reduced to
tell the truth or tell a lie.
<div class="bookquote">``Your daddy ... sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) does things he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>)'s sorry for later. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>)
doesn't think the way he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) should. That doesn't happen very often, but sometimes
it does.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) hurt George Hatfield like the time I spilled all his (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) papers?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Sometimes --
-LRB-Danny with his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) arm in a cast-RRB-
-- he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) does things he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s sorry for later.
Wendy blinked her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) eyes savagely hard, driving her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) tears all the way back.
<div class="bookquote">``Something like that, honey. Your daddy hit George to make him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) stop cutting
the tires and George hit his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head. Then the men who are in charge of the school
said that George couldn't go there anymore and your daddy couldn't teach there
anymore.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stopped, out of words, and waited in dread for the deluge of
questions.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said, and went back to looking up the street. Apparently the
subject was closed. If only it could be closed that easily for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) --
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stood up. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going upstairs for a cup of tea, doc. Want a couple of
cookies and a glass of milk?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think I'll watch for Dad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'ll be home much before five.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'ll be early.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) agreed. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was halfway up the walk when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) called, <div class="bookquote">``Mommy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What, Danny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Now, which of five thousand answers should she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) give to that one? The way she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
had felt yesterday or last night or this morning? They were all different, they

<p/>crossed the spectrum from rosy pink to dead black.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``If it's what your father wants, it's what I want.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) paused.
<div class="bookquote">``What about you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I guess I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said finally. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody much to play with around here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You miss your friends, don't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I miss Scott and Andy. That's about all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) went back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), rumpled his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lightcolored hair that was
just losing its baby-fineness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was such a solemn little boy, and sometimes
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wondered just how he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was supposed to survive with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and Jack for parents.
The high hopes they had begun with came down to this unpleasant apartment
building in a city they didn't know. The image of Danny in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) cast rose up
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) again. Somebody in the Divine Placement Service had made a mistake,
one she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sometimes feared could never be corrected and which only the most
innocent bystander could pay for.
<div class="bookquote">``Stay out of the road, doc,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, and hugged him (<font color='blue'><b>bystander</b></font>) tight.
<div class="bookquote">``Sure, Mom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) went upstairs and into the kitchen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) put on the teapot and laid a
couple of Oreos on a plate for Danny in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) decided to come up while she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was
lying down. Sitting at the table with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) big pottery cup in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
looked out the window at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), still sitting on the curb in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bluejeans and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
over-sized dark green Stovington Prep sweatshirt, the glider now lying beside
him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). The tears which had threatened all day now came in a cloudburst and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
leaned into the fragrant, curling steam of the tea and wept. In grief and loss
for the past, and terror of the future.

WATSON
You lost your temper, Ullman had said.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay, here's your furnace,''  (<font color='red'><b>Watson/Mr. Watson</b></font>)</div>Watson said, turning on a light in the dark,
musty-smelling room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) was a beefy man with fluffy popcorn hair, white shirt,
and dark green chinos. He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) swung open a small square grating in the furnace's
belly and he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) and Jack peered in together. <div class="bookquote">``This here's the pilot light.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>A
steady blue-white jet hissing steadily upward channeled destructive force, but
the key word, Jack thought, was destructive and not channeled: if you stuck your
hand in there, the barbecue would happen in three quick seconds.
Lost your temper.
-LRB-Danny, are you all right?-RRB-
The furnace filled the entire room, by far the biggest and oldest Jack had
ever seen.
<div class="bookquote">``The pilot's got a fail-safe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Watson/Mr. Watson</b></font>)</div>Watson told him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Little sensor in there

<p/>measures heat. If the heat falls below a certain point, it sets off a buzzer in
your quarters. Boiler's on the other side of the wall. I'll take you around.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>)
slammed the grating shut and led Jack behind the iron bulk of the furnace toward
another door. The iron radiated a stuporous heat at them, and for some reason
Jack thought of a large, dozing cat. Watson jingled his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) keys and whistled.
Lost your --
-LRB-When he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) went back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) study and saw Danny standing there, wearing
nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) training pants and a grin, a slow, red cloud of rage had
eclipsed Jack's reason. It had seemed slow subjectively, inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head, but it
must have all happened in less than a minute. It only seemed slow the way some
dreams seem slow. The bad ones. Every door and drawer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) study seemed to
have been ransacked in the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been gone. Closet, cupboards, the sliding
bookcase. Every desk drawer yanked out to the stop. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) manuscript, the threeact play he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been slowly developing from a novelette he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had written seven
years ago as an under-graduate, was scattered all over the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been
drinking a beer and doing the Act II corrections when Wendy said the phone was
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), and Danny had poured the can of beer all over the pages. Probably to
see it foam. See it foam, see it foam, the words played over and over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
mind like a single sick chord on an out-of-tune piano, completing the circuit of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) rage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stepped deliberately toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) threeyear-old son, who was looking
up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) with that pleased grin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pleasure at the job of work so
successfully and recently completed in Daddy's study; Danny began to say
something and that was when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had grabbed Danny's hand and bent it to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
drop the typewriter eraser and the mechanical pencil he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was clenching in it.
Danny had cried out a little ... no ... no ... tell the truth ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
screamed. It was all hard to remember through the fog of anger, the sick single
thump of that one Spike Jones chord. Wendy somewhere, asking what was wrong. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
voice faint, damped by the inner mist. This was between the two of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had
whirled Danny around to spank him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) big adult fingers digging into the scant
meat of the boy's forearm, meeting around it in a closed fist, and the snap of
the breaking bone had not been loud, not loud but it had been very loud, HUGE,
but not loud. Just enough of a sound to slit through the red fog like an arrow --
but instead of letting in sunlight, that sound let in the dark clouds of shame
and remorse, the terror, the agonizing convulsion of the spirit. A clean sound
with the past on one side of it and all the future on the other, a sound like a
breaking pencil lead or a small piece of kindling when you brought it down over
your knee. A moment of utter silence on the other side, in respect to the
beginning future maybe, all the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) life. Seeing Danny's face drain of
color until it was like cheese, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes, always large, grow larger
still, and glassy, Jack sure the boy was going to faint dead away into the
puddle of beer and papers; his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own voice, weak and drunk, slurry, trying to take
it all back, to find a way around that not too loud sound of bone cracking and
into the past -- is there a status quo in the house? -- saying: Danny, are you all
right? Danny's answering shriek, then Wendy's shocked gasp as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) came around
them and saw the peculiar angle Danny's forearm had to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) elbow; no arm was
meant to hang quite that way in a world of normal families. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) own scream as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) swept him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arms, and a nonsense babble: Oh God Danny oh dear God oh
sweet God your poor sweet arm; and Jack was standing there, stunned and stupid,

<p/>trying to understand how a thing like this could have happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was standing
there and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes met the eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wife and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) saw that Wendy hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). It
did not occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) what the hate might mean in practical terms; it was only
later that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) realized she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) might have left him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) that night, gone to a motel,
gotten a divorce lawyer in the morning; or called the police. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) saw only that
his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) wife hated him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) felt staggered by it, all alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) felt awful. This
was what oncoming death felt like. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fled for the telephone and dialed
the hospital with their screaming boy wedged in the crook of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arm and Jack
did not go after her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) only stood in the ruins of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) office, smelling beer
and thinking -- -RRB-
You lost your temper.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hand harshly across his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) lips and followed Watson into the boiler
room. It was humid in here, but it was more than the humidity that brought the
sick and slimy sweat onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) brow and stomach and legs. The remembering did
that, it was a total thing that made that night two years ago seem like two
hours ago. There was no lag. It brought the shame and revulsion back, the sense
of having no worth at all, and that feeling always made him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) want to have a
drink, and the wanting of a drink brought still blacker despair -- would he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ever
have an hour, not a week or even a day, mind you, but just one waking hour when
the craving for a drink wouldn't surprise him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) like this?
<div class="bookquote">``The boiler,''  (<font color='red'><b>Watson/Mr. Watson</b></font>)</div>Watson announced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) pulled a red and blue bandanna from his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>)
back pocket, blew his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) nose with a decisive honk, and thrust it back out of sight
after a short peek into it to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) had gotten anything interesting.
The boiler stood on four cement blocks, a long and cylindrical metal tank,
copper-jacketed and often patched. It squatted beneath a confusion of pipes and
ducts which zigzagged upward into the high, cobweb-festooned basement ceiling.
To Jack's right, two large heating pipes came through the wall from the furnace
in the adjoining room.
<div class="bookquote">``Pressure gauge is here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Watson/Mr. Watson</b></font>)</div>Watson tapped it. <div class="bookquote">``Pounds per square inch, psi. I
guess you'd know that. I got her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) up to a hundred now, and the rooms get a little
chilly at night. Few guests complain, what the fuck. They're crazy to come up
here in September anyway. Besides, this is an old baby. Got more patches on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>)
than a pair of welfare overalls.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Out came the bandanna. A honk. A peek. Back it
went.
<div class="bookquote">``I got me a fuckin cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Watson/Mr. Watson</b></font>)</div>Watson said conversationally. ``I get one every
September. I be tinkering down here with this old whore, then I be out cuttin
the grass or rakin that rogue court. Get a chill and catch a cold, my old mum
used to say. God bless her (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>) been dead six year. The cancer got her (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>). Once the
cancer gets you, you might as well make your will.
``You'll want to keep your press up to no more than fifty, maybe sixty. Mr.
Ullman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) says to heat the west wing one day, central wing the next, east wing
the day after that. Ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) a crazyman? I hate that little fucker. Yap-yap-yap
all the livelong day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)'s just like one a those little dogs that bites you on
the ankle then run around an pee all over the rug. If brains was black powder he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)
couldn't blow his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) own nose. It's a pity the things you see when you ain't got a
gun.
``Look here. You open an close these ducts by pullin these rings. I got em all
marked for you. The blue tags all go to the rooms in the east wing. Red tags is

<p/>the middle. Yellow is the west wing. When you go to heat the west wing, you got
to remember that's the side of the hotel that really catches the weather. When
it whoops, those rooms get as cold as a frigid woman with an ice cube up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
works. You can run your press all the way to eighty on west wing days. I would,
anyway.''
``The thermostats upstairs -- '' Jack began.
Watson shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) bead vehemently, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) fluffy hair bounce on his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) skull.
``They ain't hooked up. They're just there for show. Some of these people from
California, they don't think things is right unless they got it hot enough to
grow a palm tree in their fuckin bedroom. All the heat comes from down here. Got
to watch the press, though. See her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) creep?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) tapped the main dial, which had crept from a hundred pounds per square inch
to a hundred and two as Watson soliloquized. Jack felt a sudden shiver cross his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
back in a hurry and thought: The goose just walked over my grave. Then Watson
gave the pressure wheel a spin and dumped the boiler off: There was a great
hissing, and the needle dropped back to ninety-one. Watson twisted the valve
shut and the hissing died reluctantly.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) creeps,'' Watson said. ``You tell that fat little peckerwood Ullman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)
drags out the account books and spends three hours showing how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) can't afford a
new one until 1982. I tell you, this whole place is gonna go sky-high someday,
and I just hope that fat fuck's here to ride the rocket. God, I wish I could be
as charitable as my mother was. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could see the good in everyone. Me, I'm just
as mean as a snake with the shingles. What the fuck, a man can't help his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
nature.
<div class="bookquote">``Now you got to remember to come down here twice a day and once at night
before you rack in. You got to check the press. If you forget, it'll just creep
and creep and like as not you an your fambly'll wake up on the fuckin moon. You
just dump her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) off a little and you'll have no trouble.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's top end?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s rated for two-fifty, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d blow long before that now. You
couldn't get me to come down an stand next to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) when that dial was up to one
hundred and eighty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There's no automatic shutdown?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``No, there ain't. This was built before such things were required. Federal
government's into everything these days, ain't it? FBI openin mail, CIA buggin
the goddam phones ... and look what happened to that Nixon. Wasn't that a
sorry sight?
``But if you just come down here regular an check the press, you'll be fine. An
remember to switch those ducks around like he (<font color='blue'><b>Nixon</b></font>) wants. Won't none of the rooms get
much above forty-five unless we have an amazin warm winter. And you'll have your
own apartment just as warm as you like it.''
``What about the plumbing?''
<div class="bookquote">``Okay, I was just getting to that. Over here through this arch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They walked into a long, rectangular room that seemed to stretch for miles.
Watson pulled a cord and a single seventyfive-watt bulb cast a sickish, swinging
glow over the area they were standing in. Straight ahead was the bottom of the
elevator shaft, heavy greased cables descending to pulleys twenty feet in
diameter and a huge, grease-clogged motor. Newspapers were everywhere, bundled

<p/>and banded and boxed. Other cartons were marked Records or Invoices or ReceiptsSAV$1 The smell was yellow and moldy. Some of the cartons were falling apart,
spilling yellow flimsy sheets that might have been twenty years old out onto the
floor. Jack stared around, fascinated. The Overlook's entire history might be
here, buried in these rotting cartons.
<div class="bookquote">``That elevator's a bitch to keep runnin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Watson/Mr. Watson</b></font>)</div>Watson said, jerking his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) thumb at
it. ``I know Ullman's buying the state elevator inspector a few fancy dinners to
keep the repairman away from that fucker.
``Now, here's your central plumbin core.'' In front of them five large pipes,
each of them wrapped in insulation and cinched with steel bands, rose into the
shadows and out of sight.
Watson pointed to a cobwebby shelf beside the utility shaft. There were a
number of greasy rags on it, and a looseleaf binder. ``That there is all your
plumbin schematics,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) said. ``I don't think you'll have any trouble with
leaks -- never has been -- but sometimes the pipes freeze up. Only way to stop that
is to run the faucets a little bit durin the nights, but there's over four
hundred taps in this fuckin palace. That fat fairy upstairs would scream all the
way to Denver when he (<font color='blue'><b>repairman</b></font>) saw the water bill. Ain't that right?''
``I'd say that's a remarkably astute analysis.''
Watson looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) admiringly. ``Say, you really are a college fella aren't
you? Talk just like a book. I admire that, as long as the fella ain't one of
those fairy-boys. Lots of em are. You know who stirred up all those college
riots a few years ago? The hommasexshuls, that's who. They get frustrated an
have to cut loose. Comin out of the closet, they call it. Holy shit, I don't
know what the world's comin to.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, if she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) freezes, she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) most likely gonna freeze right up in this shaft. No
heat, you see. If it happens, use this.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) reached into a broken orange crate
and produced a small gas torch.
<div class="bookquote">``You just unstrap the insulation when you find the ice plug and put the heat
right to her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>). Get it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But what if a pipe freezes outside the utility core?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That won't happen if you're doin your job and keepin the place heated. You
can't get to the other pipes anyway. Don't you fret about it. You'll have no
trouble. Beastly place down here. Cobwebby. Gives me the horrors, it does.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ullman said the first winter caretaker killed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) family and himself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Yeah, that guy Grady. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) was a bad actor, I knew that the minute I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>).
Always grinnin like an egg-suck dog. That was when they were just startin out
here and that fat fuck Ullman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) woulda hired the Boston Strangler if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)'d've
worked for minimum wage. Was a ranger from the National Park that found em; the
phone was out. All of em up in the west wing on the third floor, froze solid.
Too bad about the little girls. Eight and six, they was. Cute as cut-buttons.
Oh, that was a hell of a mess. That Ullman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) manages some honky-tonky resort
place down in Florida in the off-season, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) caught a plane up to Denver and
hired a sleigh to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) up here from Sidewinder because the roads were
closed -- a sleigh, can you believe that? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) about split a gut tryin to keep it
out of the papers. Did pretty well, I got to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) that. There was an item in
the Denver Post, and of course the bituary in that pissant little rag they have
down in Estes Park, but that was just about all. Pretty good, considerin the

<p/>reputation this place has got. I expected some reporter would dig it all up
again and just sorta put Grady in it as an excuse to rake over the scandals.''
``What scandals?''
Watson shrugged. ``Any big hotels have got scandals,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) said. ``Just like every
big hotel has got a ghost. Why? Hell, people come and go. Sometimes one of em
will pop off in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) room, heart attack or stroke or something like that. Hotels
are superstitious places. No thirteenth floor or room thirteen, no mirrors on
the back of the door you come in through, stuff like that. Why, we lost a lady
just this last July. Ullman had to take care of that, and you can bet your ass
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) did. That's what they pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) twenty-two thousand bucks a season for, and as
much as I dislike the little prick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) earns it. It's like some people just come
here to throw up and they hire a guy like Ullman to clean up the messes. Here's
this woman, must be sixty fuckin years old -- my age! -- and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair's dyed just as
red as a whore's stoplight, tits saggin just about down to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) belly button on
account of she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ain't wearin no brassy-ear, big varycoarse veins all up and down
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) legs so they look like a couple of goddam roadmaps, the jools drippin off
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neck and arms an hangin out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ears. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s got this kid with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>)
can't be no more than seventeen, with hair down to his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) asshole and his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) crotch
bulgin `like he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) stuffed it with the funnypages. So they're here a week, ten days
maybe, and every night it's the same drill. Down in the Colorado Lounge from
five to seven, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suckin up singapore slings like they're gonna outlaw em
tomorrow and him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) with just the one bottle of Olympia, suckin it, makin it last.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d be makin jokes and sayin all these witty things, and every time she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
said one he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>)'d grin just like a fuckin ape, like she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had strings tied to the
corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) mouth. Only after a few days you could see it was gettin harder
an harder for him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) to grin, and God knows what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had to think about to get his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
pump primed by bedtime. Well, they'd go in for dinner, him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) walkin and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
staggerin, drunk as a coot, you know, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'d be pinchin the waitresses and
grinnin at em when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wasn't lookin. Hell, we even had bets on how long he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'d
last.''
Watson shrugged.
``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) comes down one night around ten, sayin his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) `wife' is `indisposed' --
which meant she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was passed out again like every other night they was there -- and
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s goin to get her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) some stomach medicine. So off he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) goes in the little Porsche
they come in, and that's the last we see of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). Next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) comes down and
tries to put on this big act, but all day she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s gettin paler an paler, and Mr.
Ullman asks her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), sorta diplomatic-like, would she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) like him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) to notify the state
cops, just in case maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had a little accident or something. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)
like a cat. No-no-no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)'s a fine driver, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) isn't worried, everything's under
control, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)'ll be back for dinner. So that afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) steps into the Colorado
around three and never has no dinner at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) goes up to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room around tenthirty, and that's the last time anybody saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) alive.''
``What happened?''
``County coroner said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) took about thirty sleepin pills on top of all the
booze. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband showed up the next day, some big-shot lawyer from New York.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) gave old Ullman four different shades of holy hell. I'll sue this an I'll sue
that an when I'm through you won't even be able to find a clean pair of
underwear, stuff like that. But Ullman's good, the sucker. Ullman got him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)

<p/>quieted down. Probably asked that bigshot how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)'d like to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) wife splashed
all over the New York papers: Wife of Prominent New York Blah Blah Found Dead
With Bellyful of Sleeping Pills. After playing hide-the-salami with a kid young
enough to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) grandson.
<div class="bookquote">``The state cops found the Porsche in the back of this allnight burger joint
down in Lyons, and Ullman pulled a few strings to get it released to that
lawyer. Then both of them ganged up on old Archer Houghton, which is the county
coroner, and got him (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) to change the verdict to accidental death. Heart attack.
Now ole Archer's driving a Chrysler. I don't begrudge him (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>). A man's got to take
it where he (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) finds it, especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) starts gettin along in years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Out came the bandanna. Honk. Peek. Out of sight.
<div class="bookquote">``So what happens? About a week later this stupid cunt of a chambermaid,
Delores Vickery by name, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) gives out with a helluva shriek while she (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>)'s makin
up the room where those two stayed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) faints dead away. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) comes to
she (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) seen the dead woman in the bathroom, layin naked in the tub. `Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>)
face was all purple an puffy.' she (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) says, `an she (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) was grinnin at me.' So Ullman
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) two weeks' worth of walking papers and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) to get lost. I figure
there's maybe forty-fifty people died in this hotel since my grandfather opened
it for business in 1910.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) looked shrewdly at Jack.
<div class="bookquote">``You know how most of em go? Heart attack or stroke, while they're bangin the
lady they're with. That's what these resorts get a lot of, old types that want
one last fling. They come up here to the mountains to pretend they're twenty
again. Sometimes somethin gives, and not all the guys who ran this place was as
good as Ullman is at keepin it out of the papers. So the Overlook's got a
reputation, yeah. I'll bet the fuckin Biltmore in New York City has got a
reputation, if you ask the right people.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But no ghosts?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Torrance, I've worked here all my life. I played here when I was a kid no
older'n your boy in that wallet snapshot you showed me. I never seen a ghost
yet. You want to come out back with me, I'll show you the equipment shed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Watson/Mr. Watson</b></font>)</div>As Watson reached up to turn off the light, Jack said, <div class="bookquote">``There sure are a lot
of papers down here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you're not kiddin. Seems like they go back a thousand years. Newspapers
and old invoices and bills of lading and Christ knows what else. My dad used to
keep up with them pretty good when we had the old wood-burning furnace, but now
they've got all out of hand. Some year I got to get a boy to haul them down to
Sidewinder and burn em. If Ullman will stand the expense. I guess he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) will if I
holler `rat' loud enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then there are rats?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I guess there's some. I got the traps and the poison Mr. Ullman wants
you to use up in the attic and down here. You keep a good eye on your boy, Mr.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I sure wouldn't.''  (<font color='red'><b>Watson/Mr. Watson</b></font>)</div>Coming from Watson the advice didn't sting.
They went to the stairs and paused there for a moment while Watson blew his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>)
nose again.
``You'll find all the tools you need out there and some you don't, I guess. And

<p/>there's the shingles. Did Ullman tell you about that?''
``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) wants part of the west roof reshingled.''
<div class="bookquote">``Hell get all the for-free out of you that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) can, the fat little prick, and
then whine around in the spring about how you didn't do the job half right. I
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) once right to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) face, I said ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Watson's words faded away to a comforting drone as they mounted the stairs.
Jack Torrance looked back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) shoulder once into the impenetrable, mustysmelling darkness and thought that if there was ever a place that should have
ghosts, this was it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) thought of Grady, locked in by the soft, implacable
snow, going quietly berserk and committing his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) atrocity. Did they scream? he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>)
wondered. Poor Grady, feeling it close in on him (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) more every day, and knowing at
last that for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) spring would never come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) shouldn't have been here. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>)
shouldn't have lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) temper.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) followed Watson through the door, the words echoed back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) like a
knell, accompanied by a sharp snap-like a breaking pencil lead. Dear God, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
could use a drink. Or a thousand of them.

SHADOWLAND
Danny weakened and went up for his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) milk and cookies at quarter past four. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
gobbled them while looking out the window, then went in to kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother, who
was lying down. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) suggested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stay in and watch <div class="bookquote">``Sesame Street''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-- the
time would pass faster -- but he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head firmly and went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) place
on the curb.
Now it was five o'clock, and although he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't have a watch and couldn't tell
time too well yet anyway, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was aware of passing time by the lengthening of the
shadows, and by the golden cast that now tinged the afternoon light.
Turning the glider over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sang under his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) breath: <div class="bookquote">``Skip to m
Lou, n I don't care ... skip to m Lou, n I don't care ... my master's gone
away ... Lou, Lou, skip to In Lou...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They had sung that song all together at the Jack and Jill Nursery School he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
had gone to back in Stovington. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) didn't go to nursery school out here because
Daddy couldn't afford to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) anymore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mother and father worried
about that, worried that it was adding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) loneliness -LRB-and even more deeply,
unspoken between them, that Danny blamed them-RRB-, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't really want to go
to that old Jack and Jill anymore. It was for babies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wasn't quite a big kid
yet, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wasn't a baby anymore. Big kids went to the big school and got a hot
lunch. First grade. Next year. This year was someplace between being a baby and
a real kid. It was all right. He (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) did miss Scott and Andy-mostly Scott-but it was
still all right. It seemed best to wait alone for whatever might happen next.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) understood a great many things about his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) parents, and he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) knew that many
times they didn't like his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) understandings and many other times refused to
believe them. But someday they would have to believe. He (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) was content to wait.
It was too bad they couldn't believe more, though, especially at times like
now. Mommy was lying on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) bed in the apartment, just about crying she (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) was so
worried about Daddy. Some of the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) was worried about were too grown-up
for Danny to understand-vague things that had to do with security, with Daddy's
selfimage feelings of guilt and anger and the fear of what was to become of
them-but the two main things on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) mind right now were that Daddy had had a
breakdown in the mountains -LRB-then why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) call?-RRB- or that Daddy had gone
off to do the Bad Thing. Danny knew perfectly well what the Bad Thing was since
Scotty Aaronson, who was six months older, had explained it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Scotty</b></font>). Scotty knew
because his (<font color='blue'><b>Scotty</b></font>) daddy did the Bad Thing, too. Once, Scotty told him (<font color='blue'><b>Scotty</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Scotty</b></font>) daddy had
punched his (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) mom right in the eye and knocked her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) down. Finally, Scotty's dad and
mom had gotten a DIVORCE over the Bad Thing, and when Danny had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>),
Scotty lived with his (<font color='blue'><b>Scotty</b></font>) mother and only saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Scotty</b></font>) daddy on weekends. The greatest
terror of Danny's life was DIVORCE, a word that always appeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind as a
sign painted in red letters which were covered with hissing, poisonous snakes.
In DIVORCE, your parents no longer lived together. They had a tug of war over
you in a court -LRB-tennis court? badminton court? Danny wasn't sure which or if it
was some other, but Mommy and Daddy had played both tennis and badminton at
Stovington, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) assumed it could be either-RRB- and you had to go with one of them
and you practically never saw the other one, and the one you were with could
marry somebody you didn't even know if the urge came on them. The most
terrifying thing about DIVORCE was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had sensed the word-or concept, or
whatever it was that came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) understandings-floating around in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
own parents' heads, sometimes diffuse and relatively distant, sometimes as thick
and obscuring and frightening as thunderheads. It had been that way after Daddy
punished him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) for messing the papers up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) study and the doctor had to put
his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) arm in a cast. That memory was already faded, but the memory of the DIVORCE
thoughts was clear and terrifying. It had mostly been around his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) mommy that
time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) had been in constant terror that she (<font color='blue'><b>mommy</b></font>) would pluck the word from her (<font color='blue'><b>mommy</b></font>)
brain and drag it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mommy</b></font>) mouth, making it real. DIVORCE. It was a constant
undercurrent in their thoughts, one of the few he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) could always pick up, like the
beat of simple music. But like a beat, the central thought formed only the spine
of more complex thoughts, thoughts he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) could not as yet even begin to interpret.
They came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) only as colors and moods. Mommy's DIVORCE thoughts centered
around what Daddy had done to his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) arm, and what had happened at Stovington when
Daddy lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) job. That boy. That George Hatfield who got pissed off at Daddy
and put the holes in their bug's feet. Daddy's DIVORCE thoughts were more
complex, colored dark violet and shot through with frightening veins of pure
black. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) seemed to think they would be better off if he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) left. That things would
stop hurting. His (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) daddy hurt almost all the time, mostly about the Bad Thing.
Danny could almost always pick that up too: Daddy's constant craving to go into
a dark place and watch a color TV and eat peanuts out of a bowl and do the Bad
Thing until his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) brain would be quiet and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) alone.
But this afternoon his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother had no need to worry and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could go
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that. The bug had not broken down. Daddy was not off

<p/>somewhere doing the Bad Thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was almost home now, put-putting along the
highway between Lyons and Boulder. For the moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) daddy wasn't even thinking
about the Bad Thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) was thinking about ...about...
Danny looked furtively behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) at the kitchen window. Sometimes thinking
very hard made something happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). It made things -- real things -- go away,
and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) saw things that weren't there. Once, not long after they put the
cast on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) arm, this had happened at the supper table. They weren't talking
much to each other then. But they were thinking. Oh yes. The thoughts of DIVORCE
hung over the kitchen table like a cloud full of black rain, pregnant, ready to
burst. It was so bad he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) couldn't eat. The thought of eating with all that black
DIVORCE around made him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) want to throw up. And because it had seemed desperately
important, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had thrown himself fully into concentration and something had
happened. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) came back to real things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was lying on the floor with beans
and mashed potatoes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lap and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mommy was holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and crying and
Daddy had been on the phone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been frightened, had tried to explain to
them that there was nothing wrong. that this sometimes happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
concentrated on understanding more than what normallv came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tried to
explain about Tony, who they called his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``invisible playmate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tony</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father had said: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lou</b></font>)'s having a Ha Loo Sin Nation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lou</b></font>) seems okay, but I
want the doctor to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) anyway.''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>After the doctor left, Mommy had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) promise to never do that again, to
never scare them that way, and Danny had agreed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was frightened himself.
Because when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bad concentrated his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind, it had flown out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy, and
for just a moment, before Tony had appeared -LRB-far away, as be always did, calling
distantly-RRB- and the strange things had blotted out their kitchen and the carved
roast on the blue plate, for just a moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) own consciousness had plunged
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) daddy's darkness to an incomprehensible word much more frightening
than DIVORCE, and that word was SUICIDE. Danny had never come across it again in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy's mind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had certainly not gone looking for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't care
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) never found out exactly what that word meant.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) did like to concentrate, because sometimes Tony would come. Not every
time. Sometimes things just got woozy and swimmy for a minute and then cleared --
most times, in fact -- but at other times Tony would appear at the very limit of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) vision, calling distantly and beckoning ...
It had happened twice since they moved to Boulder, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) remembered how
surprised and pleased he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) had been to find Tony had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) all the way from
Vermont. So all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) friends hadn't been left behind after all.
The first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) had been out in the back yard and nothing much had happened.
Just Tony beckoning and then darkness and a few minutes later he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) had come back
to real things with a few vague fragments of memory, like a jumbled dream. The
second time, two weeks ago, had been more interesting. Tony, beckoning, calling
from four yards over: <div class="bookquote">``Danny ... come see ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony</b></font>)</div>It seemed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) was getting
up, then falling into a deep hole, like Alice into Wonderland. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) had been
in the basement of the apartment house and Tony had been beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>), pointing
into the shadows at the trunk his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) daddy carried all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) important papers in,
especially <div class="bookquote">``THE PLAY.''
 (<font color='red'><b>daddy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``See?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony</b></font>)</div>Tony had said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) distant, musical voice. <div class="bookquote">``It's under the- stairs.
Right under the stairs. The movers put it right ... under... the stairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div><p/>Danny had stepped forward to look more closely at this marvel and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was
falling again, this time out of the back-yard swing, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been sitting
all along. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had gotten the wind knocked out of himself, too.
Three or four days later his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy had been stomping around, telling Mommy
furiously that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been all over the goddam basement and the trunk wasn't
there and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was going to sue the goddam movers who had left it somewhere
between Vermont and Colorado. How was he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) supposed to be able to finish <div class="bookquote">``THE
PLAY''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>if things like this kept cropping up?
Danny said, <div class="bookquote">``No, Daddy. It's under the stairs. The movers put it right under
the stairs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Daddy had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) a strange look and had gone down to see. The trunk had
been there, just where Tony had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>). Daddy had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) aside, had sat
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) lap, and had asked Danny who let him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) down cellar. Had it been Tom
from upstairs? The cellar was dangerous, Daddy said. That was why the landlord
kept it locked. If someone was leaving it unlocked, Daddy wanted to know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) was
glad to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) papers and his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``PLAY''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>but it wouldn't be worth it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>)
said, if Danny fell down the stairs and broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ... his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) leg. Danny told his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
father earnestly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hadn't been down in the cellar. That door was always
locked. And Mommy agreed. Danny never went down in the back hall, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said,
because it was damp and dark and spidery. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't tell lies.
<div class="bookquote">``Then how did you know, doc?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Daddy asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Tony showed me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother father</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother and father had exchanged a look over his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head. This had happened
before, from time to time. Because it was frightening, they swept it quickly
from their minds. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knew they worried about Tony, Mommy especially, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)
was careful about thinking the way that could make Tony come where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might
see. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was lying down, not moving about in the kitchen yet,
and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) concentrated hard to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) could understand what Daddy was
thinking about.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) brow furrowed and his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) slightly grimy hands clenched into tight fists on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) jeans. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) did not close his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) eyes-that wasn't necessary-but he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) squinched them
down to slits and imagined Daddy's voice, Jack's voice, John Daniel Torrance's
voice, deep and steady, sometimes quirking up with amusement or deepening even
more with anger or just staying steady because he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) was thinking. Thinking of.
Thinking about. Thinking ..
-LRB-thinking-RRB-
Danny sighed quietly and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) body slumped on the curb as if all the muscles
had gone out of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was fully conscious; he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) saw the street and the girl and
boy walking up the sidewalk on the other side, holding hands because they were
-LRB-?in love?-RRB-
so happy about the day and themselves together in the day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) saw autumn
leaves blowing along the gutter, yellow cartwheels of irregular shape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) saw
the house they were passing and noticed how the roof was covered with
-LRB-shingles. i guess it'll be no problem if the flashing's ok yeah that'll be
all right. that watson. christ what a character. wish there was a place for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
in <div class="bookquote">``THE PLAY. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>i'll end up with the whole fucking human race in it if i don't
watch out. yeah. shingles. are there nails out there? oh shit forgot to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
well they're simple to get. sidewinder hardware store. wasps. they're nesting

<p/>this time of year. i might want to get one of those bug bombs in case they're
there when i rip up the old shingles. new shingles. old-RRB-
shingles. So that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was thinking about. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had gotten the job and was
thinking about shingles. Danny didn't know who Watson was, but everything else
seemed clear enough. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) might get to see a wasps' nest. Just as sure as his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
name was
<div class="bookquote">``Danny ... Dannee ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked up and there was Tony, far up the street, standing by a stop sign
and waving. Danny, as always, felt a warm burst of pleasure at seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) old
friend, but this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) seemed to feel a prick of fear, too, as if Tony had
come with some darkness hidden behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) back. A jar-of wasps which when
released would sting deeply.
But there was no question of not going.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) slumped further down on the curb, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) hands sliding laxly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) thighs
and dangling below the fork of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) crotch. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) chin sank onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) chest. Then
there was a dim, painless tug as part of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) got up and ran after Tony into
funneling darkness.
<div class="bookquote">``Dannee -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Now the darkness was shot with swirling whiteness. A coughing, whooping sound
and bending, tortured shadows that resolved themselves into fir trees at night,
being pushed by a screaming gale. Snow swirled and danced. Snow everywhere.
<div class="bookquote">``Too deep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony</b></font>)</div>Tony said from the darkness, and there was a sadness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) voice
that terrified Danny. <div class="bookquote">``Too deep to get out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Another shape, looming, rearing. Huge and rectangular. A sloping roof.
Whiteness that was blurred in the stormy darkness. Many windows. A long building
with a shingled roof. Some of the shingles were greener, newer. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy put
them on. With nails from the Sidewinder hardware store. Now the snow was
covering the shingles. It was covering everything.
A green witchlight glowed into being on the front of the building, flickered,
and became a giant, grinning skull over two crossed bones:
<div class="bookquote">``Poison,''  (<font color='red'><b>a giant</b></font>)</div>Tony said from the floating darkness. <div class="bookquote">``Poison.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Other signs flickered past his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) eyes, some in green letters, some of them on
boards stuck at leaning angles into the snowdrifts. NO SWIMMING. DANGER! LIVE
WIRES. THIS PROPERTY CONDEMNED. HIGH VOLTAGE. THIRD RAIL. DANGER OF
DEATH. KEEP
OFF. KEEP OUT. NO TRESPASSING. VIOLATORS WILL BE SHOT ON SIGHT. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)
understood
none of them completely -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) couldn't read! -- but got a sense of all, and a dreamy
terror floated into the dark hollows of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) body like light brown spores that
would die in sunlight.
They faded. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) was in a room filled with strange furniture, a room that
was dark. Snow spattered against the windows like thrown sand. His (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) mouth was
dry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) eyes like hot marbles, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) heart triphammering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) chest. Outside
there was a hollow booming noise, like a dreadful door being thrown wide.
Footfalls. Across the room was a mirror, and deep down in its silver bubble a
single word appeared in green fire and that word was: REDRUM.
The room faded. Another room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) knew
-LRB-would know-RRB-

<p/>this one. An overturned chair. A broken window with snow swirling in; already
it had frosted the edge of the rug. The drapes had been pulled free and hung on
their broken rod at an angle. A low cabinet lying on its face.
More hollow booming noises, steady, rhythmic, horrible. Smashing glass.
Approaching destruction. A hoarse voice, the voice of a madman, made the more
terrible by its familiarity:
Come out! Came out, you little shit! Take your medicine!
Crash. Crash. Crash. Splintering wood. A bellow of rage and satisfaction.
REDRUM. Coming.
Drifting across the room. Pictures torn off the walls. A record player
-LRB-?Mommy's record player?-RRB-
overturned on the floor. Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) records, Grieg, Handel, the Beatles, Art
Garfunkel, Bach, Liszt, thrown everywhere. Broken into jagged black pie wedges.
A shaft of light coming from another room, the bathroom, harsh white light and a
word flickering on and off in the medicine cabinet mirror like a red eye,
REDRUM, REDRUM, REDRUM --
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bach</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``No, Tony please -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the porcelain lip</b></font>)</div>And, dangling over the white porcelain lip of the bathtub, a hand. Limp. A
slow trickle of blood -LRB-REDRUM-RRB- trickling down one of the fingers, the third,
dripping onto the tile from the carefully shaped nail --
No oh no oh no --
-LRB-oh please, Tony, you're scaring me-RRB-
REDRUM REDRUM REDRUM
-LRB-stop it, Tony, stop it-RRB-
Fading.
In the darkness the booming noises grew louder, louder still, echoing,
everywhere, all around.
And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) was crouched in a dark hallway, crouched on a blue rug with a riot
of twisting black shapes woven into its pile, listening to the booming noises
approach, and now a Shape turned the corner and began to come toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>),
lurching, smelling of blood and doom. It had a mallet in one hand and it was
swinging it -LRB-REDRUM-RRB- from side to side in vicious arcs, slamming it into the
walls, cutting the silk wallpaper and knocking out ghostly bursts of
plasterdust:
Come on and take your medicine! Take it like a man!
The Shape advancing on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), reeking of that sweet-sour odor, gigantic, the
mallet head cutting across the air with a wicked hissing whisper, then the great
hollow boom as it crashed into the wall, sending the dust out in a puff you
could smell, dry and itchy. Tiny red eyes glowed in the dark. The monster was
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), it had discovered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), cowering here with a blank wall at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back.
And the trapdoor in the ceiling was locked.
Darkness. Drifting.
<div class="bookquote">``Tony, please take me back, please, please -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was back, sitting on the curb of Arapahoe Street, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shirt sticking
damply to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body bathed in sweat. In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could still hear
that huge, contrapuntal booming sound and smell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own urine as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voided
himself in the extremity of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) terror. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see that limp hand dangling
over the edge of the tub with blood running down one finger, the third, and that

<p/>inexplicable word so much more horrible than any of the others: REDRUM.
And now sunshine. Real things. Except for Tony, now six blocks up, only a
speck, standing on the corner, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) voice faint and high and sweet. <div class="bookquote">``Be careful,
doc...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tony</b></font>)</div>Then, in the next instant, Tony was gone and Daddy's battered red bug was
turning the corner and chattering up the street, farting blue smoke behind it.
Danny was off the curb in a second, waving, jiving from one foot to the other,
yelling: <div class="bookquote">``Daddy! Hey, Dad! Hi! Hi!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy swung the VW into the curb, killed the engine, and opened the door.
Danny ran toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and then froze, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes widening. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) heart crawled up
into the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) throat and froze solid. Beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy, in the other
front seat, was a short-handled mallet, its head clotted with blood and hair.
Then it was just a bag of groceries.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny ... you okay, doc?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah. I'm okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy and buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face in Daddy's
sheepskin-lined denim jacket and hugged him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tight tight tight. Jack hugged him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
back, slightly bewildered.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, you don't want to sit in the sun like that, doc. You're drippin sweat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I guess I fell asleep a little. I love you, Daddy. I been waiting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I love you too, Dan. I brought home some stuff. Think you're big enough to
carry it upstairs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure am!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Doc Torrance, the world's stroneest man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said, and ruffled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hair.
<div class="bookquote">``Whose hobby is falling asleep on street corners.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then they were walking up to the door and Mommy had come down to the porch to
meet them and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stood on the second step and watched them kiss. They were glad
to see each other. Love came out of them the way love had come out of the boy
and girl walking up the street and holding hands. Danny was glad.
The bag of groceries -- just a bag of groceries -- crackled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) arms.
Everything was all right. Daddy was home. Mommy was loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). There were no
bad things. And not everything Tony showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) always happened.
But fear had settled around his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) heart, deep and dreadful, around his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) heart and
around that indecipherable word he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) had seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) spirit's mirror.

<p/><< 5 >>
PHONEBOOTH
Jack parked the VW in front of the Rexall in the Table Mesa shopping center
and let the engine die. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wondered again if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shouldn't go ahead and get the
fuel pump replaced, and told himself again that they couldn't afford it. If the
little car could keep running until November, it could retire with full honors

<p/>anyway. By November the snow up there in the mountains would be higher than the
beetle's roof ... maybe higher than three beetles stacked on top of each
other.
<div class="bookquote">``Want you to stay in the car, doc. I'll bring you a candy bar.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why can't I come in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have to make a phone call. It's private stuff.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that why you didn't make it at home?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Check.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy had insisted on a phone in spite of their unraveling finances. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had
argued that with a small child -- especially a boy like Danny, who sometimes
suffered from fainting spells -- they couldn't afford not to have one. So Jack had
forked over the thirty-dollar installation fee, bad enough, and a ninety-dollar
security deposit, which really hurt. And so far the phone had been mute except
for two wrong numbers.
<div class="bookquote">``Can I have a Baby Ruth, Daddy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. You sit still and don't play with the gearshift, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right. I'll look at the maps.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You do that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>As Jack got out, Danny opened the bug's glovebox and took out the five
battered gas station maps: Colorado, Nebraska, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
loved road maps, loved to trace where the roads went with his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) finger. As far as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was concerned, new maps were the best part of moving West.
Jack went to the drugstore counter, got Danny's candy bar, and newspaper, and
a copy of the October Writer's Digest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Writer</b></font>) gave the girl a five and asked for his (<font color='blue'><b>Writer</b></font>)
change in quarters. With the silver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Writer</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Writer</b></font>) walked over to the telephone
booth by the keymaking machine and slipped inside. From here he (<font color='blue'><b>Writer</b></font>) could see Danny
in the bug through three sets of glass. The boy's head was bent studiously over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Writer</b></font>) maps. Jack felt a wave of nearly desperate love for the boy. The emotion
showed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face as a stony grimness.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could have made his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) obligatory thank-you call to Al from home;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) certainly wasn't going to say anything Wendy would object to. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
pride that said no. These days he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) almost always listened to what his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pride told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to do, because along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wife and son, six hundred dollars in a
checking account, and one weary 1968 Volkswagen, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pride was all that was
left. The only thing that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). Even the checking account was joint. A year
ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been teaching English in one of the finest prep schools in New
England. There had been friends -- although not exactly the same ones he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'d had
before going on the wagon -- some laughs, fellow faculty members who admired his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
deft touch in the classroom and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) private dedication to writing. Things had
been very good six months ago. All at once there was enough money left over at
the end of each two-week pay period to start a little savings account. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
drinking days there had never been a penny left over, even though Al Shockley
had stood a great many of the rounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) and Wendy had begun to talk cautiously
about finding a house and making a down payment in a year or so. A farmhouse in
the country, take six or eight years to renovate it completely, what the hell,
they were young, they had time.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) temper.
George Hatfield.

<p/>The smell of hope had turned to the smell of old leather in Crommert's office,
the whole thing like some scene from his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) own play: the old prints of previous
Stovington headmasters on the walls, steel engravings of the school as it had
been in 1879, when it was first built, and in 1895, when Vanderbilt money had
enabled them to build the field house that still stood at the west end of the
soccer field, squat, immense, dressed in ivy. April ivy had been rustling
outside Crommert's slit window and the drowsy sound of steam heat came from the
radiator. It was no set, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) remembered thinking. It was real. His (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) life. How
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) have fucked it up so badly?
<div class="bookquote">``This is a serious situation, Jack. Terribly serious. The Board has asked me
to convey its decision to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>The Board wanted lack's resignation and Jack had given it to them. Under
different circumstances, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would have gotten tenure that June.
What had followed that interview in Crommert's office had been the darkest,
most dreadful night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) life. The wanting, the needing to get drunk had never
been so bad. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands shook. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knocked things over. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) kept wanting to
take it out on Wendy and Danny. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) temper was like a vicious animal on a frayed
leash. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had left the house in terror that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) might strike them. Had ended up
outside a bar, and the only thing that had kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) from going in was the
knowledge that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) did, Wendy would leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) at last, and take Danny with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would be dead from the day they left.
Instead of going into the bar, where dark shadows sat sampling the tasty
waters of oblivion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had gone to Al Shockley's house. The Board's vote had
been six to one. Al had been the one.
Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) dialed the operator and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) that for a dollar eighty-five he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>)
could be put in touch with Al two thousand miles away for three minutes. Time is
relative, baby, he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) thought, and stuck in eight quarters. Faintly he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) could hear
the electronic boops and beeps of his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) connection sniffing its way eastward.
Al's father had been Arthur Longley Shockley, the steel baron. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>)
only son, Albert, a fortune and a huge range of investments and directorships
and chairs on various boards. One of these had been on the Board of Directors
for Stovington Preparatory Academy, the old man's favorite charity. Both Arthur
and Albert Shockley were alumni and Al lived in Barre, close enough to take a
personal interest in the school's affairs. For several years Al had been
Stovington's tennis coach.
Jack and Al had become friends in a completely natural and uncoincidental way:
at the many school and faculty functions they attended together, they were
always the two drunkest people there. Shockley was separated from his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) wife, and
Jack's own marriage was skidding slowly downhill, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) still loved Wendy
and had promised sincerely -LRB-and frequently-RRB- to reform, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sake and for baby
Danny's.
The two of them went on from many faculty parties, hitting the bars until they
closed, then stopping at some mom 'n' pop-RRB- store for a case of beer they would
drink parked at the end of some back road. There were mornings when Jack would
stumble into their leased house with dawn seeping into the sky and find Wendy
and the baby asleep on the couch, Danny always on the inside, a tiny fist curled
under the shelf of Wendy's jaw. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would look at them and the self-loathing
would back up his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) throat in a bitter wave, even stronger than the taste of beer

<p/>and cigarettes and martinis -- martians, as Al called them. Those were the times
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) mind would turn thoughtfully and sanely to the gun or the rope or the
razor blade.
If the bender had occurred on a weeknight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) would sleep for three hours, get
up, dress, chew four Excedrins, and go off to teach his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) nine o'clock American
Poets still drunk. Good morning, kids, today the Red-Eyed Wonder is going to
tell you about how Longfellow lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) wife in the big fire.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) hadn't believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) was an alcoholic, Jack thought as Al's telephone began
ringing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) ear. The classes he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) had missed or taught unshaven, still reeking
of last night's martians. Not me, I can stop anytime. The nights he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) and Wendy
had passed in separate beds. Listen, I'm fine. Mashed fenders. Sure I'm okay to
drive. The tears she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) always shed in the bathroom. Cautious looks from his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>)
colleagues at any party where alcohol was served, even wine. The slowly dawning
realization that he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) was being talked about. The knowledge that he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) was producing
nothing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) Underwood but balls of mostly blank paper that ended up in the
wastebasket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) had been something of a catch for Stovington, a slowly blooming
American writer perhaps, and certainly a man well qualified to teach that great
mystery, creative writing. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had published two dozen short stories. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
working on a play, and thought there might be a novel incubating in some mental
back room. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not producing and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teaching had become erratic.
It had finally ended one night less than a month after Jack had broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
son's arm. That, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), had ended his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) marriage. All that remained was
for Wendy to gather her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) will ... if her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother hadn't been such a grade A
bitch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knew, Wendy would have taken a bus back to New Hampshire as soon as
Danny had been okay to travel. It was over.
It had been a little past midnight. Jack and Al were coming into Barre on U.S.
31, Al behind the wheel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) Jag, shifting fancily on the curves, sometimes
crossing the double yellow line. They were both very drunk; the martians had
landed that night in force. They came around the last curve before the bridge at
seventy, and there was a kid's bike in the road, and then the sharp, hurt
squealing as rubber shredded from the Jag's tires, and Jack remembered seeing
Al's face looming over the steering wheel like a round white moon. Then the
jingling crashing sound as they hit the bike at forty, and it had flown up like
a bent and twisted bird, the handlebars striking the windshield, and then it was
in the air again, leaving the starred safety glass in front of Jack's bulging
eyes. A moment later he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heard the final dreadful smash as it landed on the road
behind them. Something thumped underneath them as the tires passed over it. The
Jag drifted around broadside, Al still jockeying the wheel, and from far away
Jack heard himself saying: <div class="bookquote">``Jesus, Al.. We ran him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) down. I felt it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ear the phone kept ringing. Come on, Al.. Be home. Let me get this over
with.
Al had brought the car to a smoking halt not more than three feet from a
bridge stanchion. Two of the Jag's tires were flat. They had left zigzagging
loops of burned rubber for a hundred and thirty feet. They looked at each other
for a moment and then ran back in the cold darkness.
The bike was completely ruined. One wheel was gone, and looking back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>)
shoulder Al had seen it lying in the middle of the road, half a dozen spokes
sticking up like piano wire. Al had said hesitantly: ``I think that's what we ran

<p/>over, Tacky-boy.''
``Then where's the kid?''
``Did you see a kid?''
Jack frowned. It had all happened with such crazy speed. Coming around the
corner. The bike looming in the Jag's headlights. Al yelling something. Then the
collision and the long skid.
They moved the bike to one shoulder of the road. Al went back to the Jag and
put on its four-way flashers. For the next two hours they searched the sides of
the road, using a powerful four-cell flashlight. Nothing. Although it was late,
several cars passed the beached Jaguar and the two men with the bobbing
flashlight. None of them stopped. Jack thought later that some queer providence,
bent on giving them both a last chance, had kept the cops away, had kept any of
the passersby from calling them.
At quarter past two they returned to the Jag, sober but queasy. ``If there was
nobody riding it, what was it doing in the middle of the road?'' Al demanded. ``It
wasn't parked on the side; it was right in the fucking middle!''
Jack could only shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head.
``Your party does not answer,'' the operator said. ``Would you like me to keep on
trying?''
``A couple more rings, operator. Do you mind?''
``No, sir,'' the voice said dutifully.
Come on, Al!
Al had hiked across the bridge to the nearest pay phone, called a bachelor
friend and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) it would be worth fifty dollars if the friend would get the
Jag's snow tires out of the garage and bring them down to the Highway 31 bridge
outside of Barre. The friend showed up twenty minutes later, wearing a pair of
jeans and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pajama top. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) surveyed the scene.
``Kill anybody?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) asked.
Al was already jacking up the back of the car and Jack was loosening lug nuts.
``Providentially, no one,'' Al said.
``I think I'll just head on back anyway. Pay me in the morning.''
``Fine,'' Al said without looking up.
The two of them had gotten the tires on without incident, and together they
drove back to Al Shockley's house. Al put the Jag in the garage and killed the
motor.
In the dark quiet he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I'm off drinking, Jacky-boy. It's all over. I've
slain my last martian.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And now, sweating in this phonebooth, it occurred to Jack that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had never
doubted Al's ability to carry through. He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) had driven back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) own house in
the VW with the radio turned up, and some disco group chanted over and over
again, talismanic in the house before dawn: Do it anyway ... you wanta do it .
. . do it anyway you want ... No matter how loud he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) heard the squealing tires,
the crash. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) blinked his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) eyes shut, he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) saw that single crushed wheel with
its broken spokes pointing at the sky.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) got in, Wendy was asleep on the couch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) looked in Danny's room and
Danny was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) crib on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) back, sleeping deeply, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) arm still buried in the
cast. In the softly filtered glow from the streetlight outside he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could see the
dark lines on its plastered whiteness where all the doctors and nurses in

<p/>pediatrics had signed it.
It was an accident. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fell down the stairs.
-LRB-o you dirty liar-RRB-
It was an accident. l lost my temper.
-LRB-you fucking drunken waste god wiped snot out of his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) nose and that was you-RRB-
Listen, hey, come on, please, just an accident --
But the last plea was driven away by the image of that bobbing flashlight as
they hunted through the dry late November weeds, looking for the sprawled body
that by all good rights should have been there, waiting for the police. It
didn't matter that Al had been driving. There had been other nights when he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) had
been driving.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) pulled the covers up over Danny, went into their bedroom, and took the
Spanish Llama .38 down from the top shelf of the closet. It was in a shoe box.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sat on the bed with it for nearly an hour, looking at it, fascinated by its
deadly shine.
It was dawn when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) put it back in the box and put the box back in the closet.
That morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had called Bruckner, the department head, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) to
please post his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) classes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had the flu. Bruckner agreed, with less good grace
than was common. Jack Torrance had been extremely susceptible to the flu in the
last year.
Wendy made him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) scrambled eggs and coffee. They ate in silence. The only sound
came from the back yard, where Danny was gleefully running his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) trucks across the
sand pile with his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) good hand.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) went to do the dishes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Jack. I've been
thinking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lit a cigarette with trembling hands. No hangover this morning,
oddly enough. Only the shakes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) blinked. In the instant's darkness the bike
flew up against the windshield, starring the glass. The tires shrieked. The
flashlight bobbed.
<div class="bookquote">``I want to talk to you about ... about what's best for me and Danny. For you
too, maybe. I don't know. We should have talked about it before, I guess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Would you do something for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) asked, looking at the wavering tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
cigarette. <div class="bookquote">``Would you do me a favor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) voice was dull and neutral. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) back.
``Let's talk about it a week from today. If you still want to..,
Now she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hands lacy with suds, her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) pretty face pale and
disillusioned. ``Jack, promises don't work with you. You just go right on with -- ''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stopped, looking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes, fascinated, suddenly uncertain.
``In a week,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) voice had lost all its strength and dropped to a
whisper. ``Please. I'm not promising anything. If you still want to talk then,
we'll talk. About anything you want.''
They looked across the sunny kitchen at each other for a long time, and when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) turned back to the dishes without saying anything more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) began to shudder.
God, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) needed a drink. Just a little pick-me-up to put things in their true
perspective --
``Danny said he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) dreamed you had a car accident,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said abruptly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) has
funny dreams sometimes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said it this morning, when I got him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) dressed. Did
you, Jack? Did you have an accident?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>By noon the craving for a drink had become a low-grade fever. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went to Al's.
<div class="bookquote">``You dry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Al/Uncle Al</b></font>)</div>Al asked before letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) in. Al looked horrible.
<div class="bookquote">``Bone dry. You look like Lon Chaney in Phantom of the Opera.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come on in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They played two-handed whist all afternoon. They didn't drink.
A week passed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) and Wendy didn't speak much. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was watching,
not believing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) drank coffee black and endless cans of Coca-Cola. One night he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>)
drank a whole six-pack of Coke and then ran into the bathroom and vomited it up.
The level of the bottles in the liquor cabinet did not go down. After his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>)
classes he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) went over to Al Shockley's-she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hated Al Shockley worse than she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had
ever hated anyone-and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) came home she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would swear she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) smelled scotch or
gin on his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) breath, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) would talk lucidly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) before supper, drink coffee,
play with Danny after supper, sharing a Coke with him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), read him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) a bedtime story,
then sit and correct themes with cup after cup of black coffee by his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would have to admit to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had been wrong.
Weeks passed and the unspoken word retreated further from the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
lips. Jack sensed its retirement but knew it would never retire completely.
Things began to get a little easier. Then George Hatfield. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>)
temper again, this time stone sober.
<div class="bookquote">``Sir, your party still doesn't -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Al/Uncle Al</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hello?''  (<font color='red'><b>Al/Uncle Al</b></font>)</div>Al's voice, out of breath.
<div class="bookquote">``Go ahead,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the operator said dourly.
<div class="bookquote">``Al, this is Jack Torrance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jacky-boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Genuine pleasure. <div class="bookquote">``How are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good. I just called to say thanks. I got the job. It's perfect. If I can't
finish that goddam play snowed in all winter, I'll never finish it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'll finish.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How are things?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack asked hesitantly.
<div class="bookquote">``Dry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Al/Uncle Al</b></font>)</div>Al responded. <div class="bookquote">``You?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``As a bone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Miss it much?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Every day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Al/Uncle Al</b></font>)</div>Al laughed. <div class="bookquote">``I know that scene. But I don't know how you stayed dry after that
Hatfield thing, Jack. That was above and beyond.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I really bitched things up for myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) said evenly.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, hell. I'll have the Board around by spring. Effinger's already saying
they might have been too hasty. And if that play comes to something -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Listen, my boy's out in the car, Al.. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looks like he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might be getting
restless -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure. Understand. You have a good winter up there, Jack. Glad to help.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thanks again, Al.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) hung up, closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) eyes in the hot booth, and again
saw the crashing bike, the bobbing flashlight. There had been a squib in the
paper the next day, no more than a space-filler really, but the owner had not
been named. Why it had been out there in the night would always be a mystery to
them, and perhaps that was as it should be.
He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) went back out to the car and gave Danny his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) slightly melted Baby Ruth.
<div class="bookquote">``Daddy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, doc?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny hesitated, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father's abstracted face.
<div class="bookquote">``When I was waiting for you to come back from that hotel, I had a bad dream.
Do you remember? When I fell asleep?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Um-hm.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But it was no good. Daddy's mind was someplace else, not with him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). Thinking
about the Bad Thing again.
-LRB-I dreamed that you hurt me, Daddy-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``What was the dream, doc?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said as they pulled out into the parking lot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) put the maps
back into the glove compartment.
<div class="bookquote">``You sure?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) son a faint, troubled glance; and then his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mind turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
play.

<p/><< 6 >>
NIGHT THOUGHTS
Love was over, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) man was sleeping beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>).
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) man.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) smiled a little in the darkness, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seed still trickling with slow warmth
from between her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) slightly parted thighs, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) smile was both rueful and
pleased, because the phrase her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) man summoned up a hundred feelings. Each feeling
examined alone was a bewilderment. Together, in this darkness floating to sleep,
they were like a distant blues tune heard in an almost deserted night club,
melancholy but pleasing.
Lovin' you baby, is just like rollin' off a log,
But if I can't be your woman, I sure ain't goin' to be your dog.
Had that been Billie Holiday? Or someone more prosaic like Peggy Lee? Didn't
matter. It was low and torchy, and in the silence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) head it played
mellowly, as if issuing from one of those old-fashioned jukeboxes, a Wurlitzer,
perhaps, half an hour before closing.
Now, moving away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) consciousness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) wondered how many beds she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) had
slept in with this man beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>). They had met in college and had first made
love in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) apartment ... that had been less than three months after her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>)
mother drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) from the house, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) never to come back, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) wanted
to go somewhere she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) could go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) father since she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) had been responsible for
the divorce. That bad been in 1970. So long ago? A semester later they had moved

<p/>in together, had found jobs for the summer, and had kept the apartment when
their senior year began. She (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) remembered that bed the most clearly, a big double
that sagged in the middle. When they made love, the rusty box spring had counted
the beats. That fall she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) had finally managed to break from her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) mother. Jack had
helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) wants to keep beating you, Jack had said. The more times you
phone her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>), the more times you crawl back begging forgiveness, the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) can
beat you with your father. It's good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>), Wendy, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) can go on
making believe it was your fault. But it's not good for you. They had talked it
over again and again in that bed, that year.
-LRB-Jack sitting up with the covers pooled around his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) waist, a cigarette burning
between his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fingers, looking her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) in the eye -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had a half-humorous, halfscowling way of doing that -- telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>): She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) told you never to come back, right?
Never to darken her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) door again, right? Then why doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hang up the phone
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knows it's you? Why does she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) only tell you that you can't come in if
I'm with you? Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thinks I might cramp her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) style a little bit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wants
to keep putting the thumbscrews right to you, baby. You're a fool if you keep
letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) do it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) told you never to come back, so why don't you take her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) word? Give it a rest. And at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)'d seen it his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) way.-RRB-
It had been Jack's idea to separate for a while -- to get perspective on the
relationship, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had been afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had become interested in someone
else. Later she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) found it wasn't so. They were together again in the spring and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had been to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had jumped as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'d struck
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) with a quirt.
How did you know that?
The Shadow knows.
Have you been spying on me?
And his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) impatient laughter, which had always made her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) feel so awkward -- as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) were eight and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was able to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) motivations more clearly than she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
You needed time, Wendy.
For what?
I guess ... to see which one of us you wanted to marry.
Jack, what are you saying?
I think I'm proposing marriage.
The wedding. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) father had been there, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother had not been. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
discovered she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could live with that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had Jack. Then Danny had come, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
fine son.
That had been the best year, the best bed. After Danny was born, Jack had
gotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) a job typing for half a dozen English Department profs -- quizzes,
exams, class syllabi, study notes, reading lists. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ended up tvping a novel
for one of them, a novel that never got published ... much to Jack's very
irreverent and very private glee. The job was good for forty a week, and
skyrocketed all the way up to sixty during the two months she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) spent typing the
unsuccessful novel. They had their first car, a five-year-old Buick with a baby
seat in the middle. Bright, upwardly mobile young marrieds. Danny forced a
reconciliation between her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother, a reconciliation that was always
tense and never happy, but a reconciliation all the same. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) took Danny to
the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) went without Jack. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) didn't tell Jack that her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother
always remade Danny's diapers, frowned over his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) formula, could always spot the

<p/>accusatory first signs of a rash on the baby's bottom or privates. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother
never said anything overtly, but the message came through anyway: the price she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
had begun to pay -LRB-and maybe always would-RRB- for the reconciliation was the feeling
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was an inadequate mother. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother's way of keeping the
thumbscrews handy.
During the days Wendy would stay home and housewife, feeding Danny his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bottles
in the sunwashed kitchen of the four-room second-story apartment, playing her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>)
records on the battered portable stereo she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) had had since high school. Jack
would come home at three -LRB-or at two if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) last class-RRB-, and
while Danny slept he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would lead her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) into the bedroom and fears of inadequacy
would be erased.
At night while she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) typed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would do his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) writing and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) assignments. In
those days she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) sometimes came out of the bedroom where the typewriter was to
find both of them asleep on the studio couch, Jack wearing nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
underpants, Danny sprawled comfortably on her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) husband's chest with his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thumb in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth. She (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) would put Danny in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) crib, then read whatever Jack had written
that night before waking him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) up enough to come to bed.
The best bed, the best year.
Sun gonna shine in my backyard someday ...
In those days, Jack's drinking had still been well in hand. On Saturday nights
a bunch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fellow students would drop over and there would be a case of beer
and discussions in which she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) seldom took part because her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) field had been
sociology and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was English: arguments over whether Pepys's diaries were
literature or history; discussions of Charles Olson's poetry; sometimes the
reading of works in progress. Those and a hundred others. No, a thousand. She (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>)
felt no real urge to take part; it was enough to sit in her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) rocking chair beside
Jack, who sat cross-legged on the floor, one hand holding a beer, the other
gently cupping her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) calf or braceleting her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) ankle.
The competition at UNH had been fierce, and Jack carried an extra burden in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) writing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) put in at least an hour at it every night. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) routine.
The Saturday sessions were necessary therapy. They let something out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) that
might otherwise have swelled and swelled until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) burst.
At the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) grad work he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had landed the job at Stovington, mostly on the
strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stories -- four of them published at that time, one of them in
Esquire. She (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) remembered that day clearly enough; it would take more than three
years to forget it. She (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) had almost thrown the envelope away, thinking it was a
subscription offer. Opening it, she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) had found instead that it was a letter
saying that Esquire would like to use Jack's story <div class="bookquote">``Concerning the Black Holes''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>early the following year. They would pay nine hundred dollars, not on
publication but on acceptance. That was nearly half a year's take typing papers
and she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) had flown to the telephone, leaving Danny in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) high chair to goggle
comically after her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face lathered with creamed peas and beef puree.
Jack had arrived from the university forty-five minutes later, the Buick
weighted down with seven friends and a keg of beer. After a ceremonial toast
-LRB-Wendy also had a glass, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ordinarily had no taste for beer-RRB-, Jack
had signed the acceptance letter, put it in the return envelope, and went down

<p/>the block to drop it in the letter box. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) came back he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stood gravely in
the door and said, <div class="bookquote">``Veni, vidi, vici.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There were cheers and applause. When the
keg was empty at eleven that night, Jack and the only two others who were still
ambulatory went on to hit a few bars.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had gotten him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) aside in the downstairs hallway. The other two were already
out in the car, drunkenly singing the New Hampshire fight song. Jack was down on
one knee, owlishly fumbling with the lacings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) moccasins.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you shouldn't. You can't even tie your shoes, let alone
drive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stood up and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands calmly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``Tonight I could fly to
the moon if I wanted to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Not for all the Esquire stories in the world.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll be home early.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hadn't been home until four in the morning, stumbling and mumbling his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
way up the stairs, waking Danny up when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) came in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had tried to soothe the
baby and dropped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) on the floor. Wendy had rushed out, thinking of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
mother would think if she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw the bruise before she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought of anything else --
God help her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), God help them both -- and then picked Danny up, sat in the rocking
chair with him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had been thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother for most of the
five hours Jack had been gone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother's prophecy that Jack would never come
to anything. Big ideas, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother had said. Sure. The welfare lines are full of
educated fools with big ideas. Did the Esquire story make her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother wrong or
right? Winnifred, you're not holding that baby right. Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to me. And was
she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) not holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) husband right? Why else would he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) take his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) joy out of the
house? A helpless kind of terror had risen up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) and it never occurred to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had gone out for reasons that had nothing to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Congratulations,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) said, rocking Danny -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was almost asleep again. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe
you gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) a concussion.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's just a bruise.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sounded sulky, wanting to be repentant: a little boy.
For an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Maybe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) said tightly. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe not.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) heard so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) mother
talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) departed father in her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) own voice that she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) was sickened and
afraid.
<div class="bookquote">``Like mother like daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack muttered.
<div class="bookquote">``Go to bed!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) cried, her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) fear coming out sounding like anger. <div class="bookquote">``Go to bed,
you're drunk!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me what to do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jack ... please, we shouldn't ... it ...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There were no words.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me what to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) repeated sullenly, and then went into the
bedroom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) was left alone in the rocking chair with Danny, who was sleeping
again. Five minutes later Jack's snores came floating out to the living room.
That had been the first night she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) had slept on the couch.
Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) turned restlessly on the bed, already dozing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) mind, freed of any
linear order by encroaching sleep, floated past the first year at Stovington,
past the steadily worsening times that had reached low ebb when her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) husband had
broken Danny's arm, to that morning in the breakfast nook.
Danny outside playing trucks in the sandpile, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) arm still in the cast. Jack
sitting at the table, pallid and grizzled, a cigarette jittering between his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)

<p/>fingers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) had decided to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) for a divorce. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) had pondered the question
from a hundred different angles, had been pondering it in fact for the six
months before the broken arm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) told herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) would have made the decision
long ago if it hadn't been for Danny, but not even that was necessarily true.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) dreamed on the long nights when Jack was out, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) dreams were always of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) mother's face and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) own wedding.
-LRB-Who giveth this woman? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) father standing in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) best suit which was none
too good -- he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a traveling salesman for a line of canned goods that even then
was going broke -- and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tired face, how old he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked, how pale: I do.-RRB-
Even after the accident -- if you could call it an accident -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) had not been
able to bring it all the way out, to admit that her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) marriage was a lopsided
defeat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) had waited, dumbly hoping that a miracle would occur and Jack would
see what was happening, not only to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>). But there had been no
slowdown. A drink before going off to the Academy. Two or three beers with lunch
at the Stovington House. Three or four martinis before dinner. Five or six more
while grading papers. The weekends were worse. The nights out with Al Shockley
were worse still. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) had never dreamed there could be so much pain in a life
when there was nothing physically wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) hurt all the time. How much of it
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) fault? That question haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) felt like her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) mother. Like her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>)
father. Sometimes, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) felt like herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) wondered what it would be like
for Danny, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) dreaded the day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) grew old enough to lay blame. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>)
wondered where they would go. She (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) had no doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) mother would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) in, and
no doubt that after a year of watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) diapers remade, Danny's meals
recooked and/or redistributed, of coming home to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) clothes changed or his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
hair cut or the books her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) mother found unsuitable spirited away to some limbo in
the attic ... after half a year of that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) would have a complete nervous
breakdown. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) mother would pat her (<font color='blue'><b>Winnifred</b></font>) hand and say comfortingly, Although it's
not your fault, it's all your own fault. You were never ready. You showed your
true colors when you came between your father and me.
My father, Danny's father. Mine, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).
-LRB-Who giveth this woman? I do. Dead of a heart attack six months later.-RRB-
The night before that morning she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had lain awake almost until he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) came in,
thinking, coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) decision.
The divorce was necessary, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother and father didn't
belong in the decision. Neither did her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feelings of guilt over their marriage
nor her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feelings of inadequacy over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own. It was necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son's
sake, and for herself, if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was to salvage anything at all from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) early
adulthood. The handwriting on the wall was brutal but clear. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband was a
lush. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had a bad temper, one he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could no longer keep wholly under control now
that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was drinking so heavily and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) writing was going so badly. Accidentally
or not accidentally, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had broken Danny's arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was going to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) job, if
not this year then the year after. Already she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had noticed the sympathetic looks
from the other faculty wives. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had stuck with the messy
job of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) marriage for as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have to leave it.
Jack could have full visitation rights, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would want support from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) only
until she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could find something and get on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet -- and that would have to be
fairly rapidly because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) didn't know how long Jack would be able to pay
support money. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would do it with as little bitterness as possible. But it had

<p/>to end.
So thinking, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had fallen off into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own thin and unrestful sleep, haunted
by the faces of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own mother and father. You're nothing but a home-wrecker,
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother said. Who giveth this, woman? the minister said. I do, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father
said. But in the bright and sunny morning she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt the same. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands plunged in warm dishwater up to the wrists, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had commenced with the
unpleasantness.
<div class="bookquote">``I want to talk to you about something that might be best for Danny and I. For
you too, maybe. We should have talked about it before, I guess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had said an odd thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had expected to discover his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) anger, to
provoke the bitterness, the recriminations. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had expected a mad dash for the
liquor cabinet. But not this soft, almost toneless reply that was so unlike him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
It was almost as though the Jack she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had lived with for six years had never come
back last night -- as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been replaced by some unearthly doppelganger that
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would never know or be quite sure of.
<div class="bookquote">``Would you do something for me? A favor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had to discipline her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice strictly to keep it from trembling.
<div class="bookquote">``Let's talk about it in a week. If you still want to''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had agreed. It remained unspoken between them. During that week he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had
seen Al Shockley more than ever, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) came home early and there was no liquor
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) breath. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) imagined she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) smelled it, but knew it wasn't so. Another week.
And another.
Divorce went back to committee, unvoted on.
What had happened? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) still wondered and still had not the slightest idea.
The subject was taboo between them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was like a man who had leaned around a
corner and had seen an unexpected monster lying in wait, crouching among the
dried bones of its old kills. The liquor remained in the cabinet, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) didn't
touch it. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had considered throwing them out a dozen times but in the end
always backed away from the idea, as if some unknown charm would be broken by
the act.
And there was Danny's part in it to consider.
If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't know her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband, then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was in awe of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child -- awe
in the strict meaning of that word: a kind of undefined superstitious dread.
Dozing lightly, the image of the instant of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) birth was presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was again lying on the delivery table, bathed in sweat, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hair in strings,
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feet splayed out in the stirrups
-LRB-and a little high from the gas they kept giving her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) whiffs of; at one point
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had muttered that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt like an advertisement for gang rape, and the
nurse, an old bird who had assisted at the births of enough children to populate
a high school, found that extremely funny-RRB-
the doctor between her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) legs, the nurse off to one side, arranging instruments
and humming. The sharp, glassy pains had been coming at steadily shortening
intervals, and several times she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had screamed in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shame.
Then the doctor told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) quite sternly that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must PUSH, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did, and
then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt something being taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). It was a clear and distinct
feeling, one she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would never forget-the thing taken. Then the doctor held her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
son up by the legs-she had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) tiny sex and known he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was a boy immediatelyand as the doctor groped for the airmask, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had seen something else, something

<p/>so horrible that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) found the strength to scream again after she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had thought
all screams were used up:
He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has no face!
But of course there had been a face, Danny's own sweet face, and the caul that
had covered it at birth now resided in a small jar which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had kept, almost
shamefully. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not hold with old superstition, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had kept the caul
nevertheless. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not hold with wives' tales, but the boy had been unusual
from the first. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not believe in second sight but --
Did Daddy have an accident? I dreamed Daddy had an accident.
Something had changed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't believe it was just her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) getting ready to
ask for a divorce that had done it. Something had happened before that morning.
Something that had happened while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) slept uneasily. Al Shockley said that
nothing had happened, nothing at all, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) had averted his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) eyes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) said
it, and if you believed faculty gossip, Al had also climbed aboard the fabled
wagon.
Did Daddy have an accident?
Maybe a chance collision with fate, surely nothing much more concrete. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
read that day's paper and the next day's with a closer eye than usual, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
saw nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could connect with Jack. God help her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been looking for
a hit-and-run accident or a barroom brawl that had resulted in serious injuries
or ... who knew? Who wanted to? But no policeman came to call, either to ask
questions or with a warrant empowering him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) to take paint scrapings from the WV's
bumpers. Nothing. Only her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband's one hundred and eighty degree change and
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son's sleepy question on waking:
Did Daddy have an accident? I dreamed ...
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had stuck with Jack more for Danny's sake than she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would admit in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
waking hours, but now, sleeping lightly, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could admit it: Danny had been
Jack's for the asking, almost from the first. Just as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father's,
almost from the first. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) couldn't remember Danny ever spitting a bottle back
on Jack's shirt. Jack could get him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to eat after she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had given up in disgust,
even when Danny was teething and it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) visible pain to chew. When Danny
had a stomachache, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would rock him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) for an hour before he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) began to quiet; Jack
had only to pick him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) up, walk twice around the room with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), and Danny would be
asleep on lack's shoulder, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thumb securely corked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hadn't minded changing diapers, even those he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) called the special
deliveries. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sat with Danny for hours on end, bouncing him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lap, playing
finger games with him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), making faces at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) while Danny poked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) nose and
then collapsed with the giggles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) made formulas and administered them
faultlessly, getting up every last burp afterward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would take Danny with him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
in the car to get the paper or a bottle of milk or nails at the hardware store
even when their son was still an infant. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had taken Danny to a StovingtonKeene soccer match when Danny was only six months old, and Danny had sat
motionlessly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father's lap through the whole game, wrapped in a blanket, a
small Stovington pennant clutched in one chubby fist.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother but he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father's boy.
And hadn't she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt, time and time again, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son's wordless opposition to the
whole idea of divorce? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be thinking about it in the kitchen, turning it
over in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned the potatoes for supper over in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands for the

<p/>peeler's blade. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would turn around to see him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sitting cross-legged in a
kitchen chair, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with eyes that seemed both frightened and
accusatory. Walking with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in the park, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would suddenly seize both her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands
and say -- almost demand: <div class="bookquote">``Do you love me? Do you love daddy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And, confused, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
would nod or say, <div class="bookquote">``Of course I do, honey.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would run to the duck pond,
sending them squawking and scared to the other end, flapping their wings in a
panic before the small ferocity of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) charge, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to stare after him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
and wonder.
There were even times when it seemed that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) determination to at least
discuss the matter with Jack dissolved, not out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own weakness, but under
the determination of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son's will.
I don't believe such things.
But in sleep she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did believe them, and in sleep, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband's seed still
drying on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thighs, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt that the three of them had been permanently
welded together -- that if their three/oneness was to be destroyed, it would not
be destroyed by any of them but from outside.
Most of what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) believed centered around her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) love for Jack. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had never
stopped loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), except maybe for that dark period immediately following
Danny's <div class="bookquote">``accident.''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son. Most of all she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loved them together,
walking or riding or only sitting, Jack's large head and Danny's small one
poised alertly over the fans of old maid hands, sharing a bottle of Coke,
looking at the funnies. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) loved having them with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) hoped to dear
God that this hotel caretaking job Al had gotten for Jack would be the beginning
of good times again.
And the wind gonna rise up, baby,
and blow my blues away ...
Soft and sweet and mellow, the song came back and lingered, following her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) down
into a deeper sleep where thought ceased and the faces that came in dreams went
unremembered.

IN ANOTHER BEDROOM
Danny awoke with the booming still loud in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ears, and the drunk, savagely
pettish voice crying hoarsely: Come out here and take your medicine! I'll find
you! I'll find youl
But now the booming was only his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) racing heart, and the only voice in the night
was the faraway sound of a police siren.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lay in bed motionlessly, looking up at the wind-stirred shadows of the

<p/>leaves on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bedroom ceiling. They twined sinuously together, making shapes
like the vines and creepers in a jungle, like patterns woven into the nap of a
thick carpet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was clad in Doctor Denton pajamas, but between the pajama suit
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) skin he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had grown a more closely fitting singlet of perspiration.
<div class="bookquote">``Tony?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``You there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No answer.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) slipped out of bed and padded silently across to the window and looked out
on Arapahoe Street, now still and silent. It was two in the morning. There was
nothing out there but empty sidewalks drifted with fallen leaves, parked cars,
and the long-necked streetlight on the corner across from the Cliff Brice gas
station. With its hooded top and motionless stance, the streetlight looked like
a monster in a space show.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Brice</b></font>) looked up the street both ways, straining his (<font color='blue'><b>Brice</b></font>) eyes for Tony's slight,
beckoning form, but there was no one there.
The wind sighed through the trees, and the fallen leaves rattled up the
deserted walks and around the hubcaps of parked cars. It was a faint and
sorrowful sound, and the boy thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might be the only one in Boulder
awake enough to hear it. The only human being, at least. There was no way of
knowing what else might be out in the night, slinking hungrily through the
shadows, watching and scenting the breeze.
I'll find you! I'll find you!
<div class="bookquote">``Tony?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) whispered again, but without much hope.
Only the wind spoke back, gusting more strongly this time, scattering leaves
across the sloping roof below his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) window. Some of them slipped into the
raingutter and came to rest there like tired dancers.
Danny ... Danneee ...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) started at the sound of that familiar voice and craned out the window, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
small hands on the sill. With the sound of Tony's voice the whole night seemed
to have come silently and secretly alive, whispering even when the wind quieted
again and the leaves were still and the shadows had stopped moving. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) saw a darker shadow standing by the bus stop a block down, but it was hard to
tell if it was a real thing or an eye-trick.
Don't go, Danny . .
Then the wind gusted again, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) squint, and the shadow by the bus stop
was gone ... if it had ever been there at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stood by his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) window for
-LRB-a minute? an hour?-RRB-
some time longer, but there was no more. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) crept back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bed
and pulled the blankets up and watched the shadows thrown by the alien
streetlight turn into a sinuous jungle filled with flesh-eating plants that
wanted only to slip around him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), squeeze the life out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), and drag him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) down
into a blackness where one sinister word flashed in red:
REDRUM.

A VIEW OF THE OVERLOOK
Mommy was worried.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was afraid the bug wouldn't make it up and down all these mountains and
that they would get stranded by the side of the road where somebody might come
ripping along and hit them. Danny himself was more sanguine; if Daddy thought
the bug would make this one last trip, then probably it would.
<div class="bookquote">``We're just about there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said.
Wendy brushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hair back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) temples. <div class="bookquote">``Thank God.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was sitting in the right-hand bucket, a Victoria Holt paperback open but
face down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lap. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was wearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) blue dress, the one Danny thought was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) prettiest. It had a sailor collar and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) look very young, like a girl
just getting ready to graduate from high school. Daddy kept putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand
high up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) leg and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) kept laughing and brushing it off, saying Get away,
fly.
Danny was impressed with the mountains. One day Daddy had taken them up in the
ones near Boulder, the ones they called the Flatirons, but these were much
bigger, and on the tallest of them you could see a fine dusting of snow, which
Daddy said was often there year-round.
And they were actually in the mountains, no goofing around. Sheer rock faces
rose all around them, so high you could barely see their tops even by craning
your neck out the window. When they left Boulder, the temperature had been in
the high seventies. Now, just after noon, the air up here felt crisp and cold
like November back in Vermont and Daddy had the heater going ... not that it
worked all that well. They had passed several signs that said FALLING ROCK ZONE
-LRB-Mommy read each one to him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)-RRB-, and although Danny had waited anxiously to see
some rock fall, none had. At least not yet.
Half an hour ago they had passed another sign that Daddy said was very
important. This sign said ENTERING SIDEWINDER PASS, and Daddy said that sign was

<p/>as far as the snowplows went in the wintertime. After that the road got too
steep. In the winter the road was closed from the little town of Sidewinder,
which they had gone through just before they got to that sign, all the way to
Buckland, Utah.
Now they were passing another sign.
<div class="bookquote">``What's that one, Mom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That one says SLOWER VEHICLES USE RIGHT LANE. That means us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The bug will make it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said.
<div class="bookquote">``Please, God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mommy</b></font>)</div>Mommy said, and crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) fingers. Danny looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>)
open-toed sandals and saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) had crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) toes as well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) giggled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>)
smiled back, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) was still worried.
The road wound up and up in a series of slow S curves, and Jack dropped the
bug's stick shift from fourth gear to third, then into second. The bug wheezed
and protested, and Wendy's eye fixed on the speedometer needle, which sank from
forty to thirty to twenty, where it hovered reluctantly.
<div class="bookquote">``The fuel pump...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) began timidly.
<div class="bookquote">``The fuel pump will go another three miles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said shortly.
The rock wall fell away on their right, disclosing a slash valley that seemed
to go down forever, lined a dark green with Rocky Mountain pine and spruce. The
pines fell away to gray cliffs of rock that dropped for hundreds of feet before
smoothing out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw a waterfall spilling over one of them, the early
afternoon sun sparkling in it like a golden fish snared in a blue net. They were
beautiful mountains but they were hard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) did not think they would forgive
many mistakes. An unhappy foreboding rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) throat. Further west in the
Sierra Nevada the Donner Party had become snowbound and had resorted to
cannibalism to stay alive. The mountains did not forgive many mistakes.
With a punch of the clutch and a jerk, Jack shifted down to first gear and
they labored upward, the bug's engine thumping gamely.
<div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think we've seen five cars since we came
through Sidewinder. And one of them was the hotel limousine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Jack nodded. <div class="bookquote">``It goes right to Stapleton Airport in Denver. There's already
some icy patches up beyond the hotel, Watson says, and they're forecasting more
snow for tomorrow up higher. Anybody going through the mountains now wants to be
on one of the main roads, just in case. That goddam Ullman better still be up
there. I guess he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) will be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're sure the larder is fully stocked?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) asked, still thinking of the
Donners.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) said so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) wanted Hallorann to go over it with you. Hallorann's the
cook.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said faintly, looking at the speedometer. It had dropped from
fifteen to ten miles an hour.
<div class="bookquote">``There's the top,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said, pointing three hundred yards ahead. <div class="bookquote">``There's a
scenic turnout and you can see the Overlook from there. I'm going to pull off
the road and give the bug a chance to rest.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) craned over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shoulder at
Danny, who was sitting on a pile of blankets. <div class="bookquote">``What do you think, doc? We might
see some deer. Or caribou.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure, Dad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>VW</b></font>)</div>The VW labored up and up. The speedometer dropped to just above the five-mile-

<p/>an-hour hashmark and was beginning to hitch when Jack pulled off the road
-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``What's that sign, Mommy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``SCENIC TURNOUT,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) read dutifully.-RRB-
and stepped on the emergency brake and let the VW run in neutral.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, and got out.
They walked to the guardrail together.
<div class="bookquote">``That's it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said, and pointed at eleven o'clock.
For Wendy, it was discovering truth in a cliché: her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breath was taken away.
For a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was unable to breathe at all; the view had knocked the wind
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). They were standing near the top of one peak. Across from them -- who
knew how far? -- an even taller mountain reared into the sky, its jagged tip only
a silhouette that was now nimbused by the sun, which was beginning its decline.
The whole valley floor was spread out below them, the slopes that they had
climbed in the laboring bug falling away with such dizzying suddenness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
knew to look down there for too long would bring on nausea and eventual
vomiting. The imagination seemed to spring to full life in the clear air, beyond
the rein of reason, and to look was to helplessly see one's self plunging down
and down and down, sky and slopes changing places in slow cartwheels, the scream
drifting from your mouth like a lazy balloon as your hair and your dress
billowed out ...
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) jerked her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) gaze away from the drop almost by force and followed Jack's
finger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could see the highway clinging to the side of this cathedral spire,
switching back on itself but always tending northwest, still climbing but at a
more gentle angle. Further up, seemingly set directly into the slope itself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
saw the grimly clinging pines give way to a wide square of green lawn and
standing in the middle of it, overlooking all this, the hotel. The Overlook.
Seeing it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) found breath and voice again.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jack, it's gorgeous!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Ullman says he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) thinks it's the single most beautiful
location in America. I don't care much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>), but I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) might be ...
Danny! Danny, are you all right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked around for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sudden fear for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) blotted out everything
else, stupendous or not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) darted toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was holding onto the
guardrail and looking up at the hotel, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face a pasty gray color. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes had
the blank look of someone on the verge of fainting.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knelt beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and put steadying hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``Danny,
what's -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack was beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You okay, doc?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) gave Danny a brisk little shake and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes cleared.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm okay, Daddy. I'm fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What was it, Danny?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Were you dizzy, honey?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I was just ... thinking. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) parents, kneeling in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), and offered them a small
puzzled smile. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe it was the sun. The sun got in my eyes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We'll get you up to the hotel and give you a drink of water,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daddy</b></font>)</div>Daddy said.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And in the bug, which moved upward more surely on the gentler grade, he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) kept
looking out between them as the road unwound, affording occasional glimpses of
the Overlook Hotel, its massive bank of westward-looking windows reflecting

<p/>back the sun. It was the place he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) had seen in the midst of the blizzard, the
dark and booming place where some hideously familiar figure sought him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) down long
corridors carpeted with jungle. The place Tony had warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) against. It was
here. It was here. Whatever Redrum was, it was here.

CHECKING IT OUT
Ullman was waiting for them just inside the wide, old-fashioned front doors.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) shook hands with Jack and nodded coolly at Wendy, perhaps noticing the way
heads turned when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) came through into the lobby, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) golden hair spilling
across the shoulders of the simple navy dress. The hem of the dress stopped a
modest two inches above the knee, but you didn't have to see more to know they
were good legs.
Ullman seemed truly warm toward Danny only, but Wendy had experienced that
before. Danny seemed to be a child for people who ordinarily held W. C. Fields'
sentiments about children. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bent a little from the waist and offered Danny his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
hand. Danny shook it formally, without a smile.
<div class="bookquote">``My son Danny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``And my wife Winnifred.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm happy to meet you both,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman said. <div class="bookquote">``How old are you, Danny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Five, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sir, yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman smiled and glanced at Jack. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s well mannered.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said.
<div class="bookquote">``And Mrs. Torrance.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) offered the same little bow, and for a bemused instant
Wendy thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) half-offered it and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did take it,
but only for a moment, clasped in both of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands were small and dry and
smooth, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) guessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) powdered them.
The lobby was a bustle of activity. Almost every one of the old-fashioned
high-backed chairs was taken. Bellboys shuttled in and out with suitcases and
there was a line at the desk, which was dominated by a huge brass cash register.
The BankAmericard and Master Charge decals on it seemed jarringly anachronistic.
To their right, down toward a pair of tall double doors that were pulled
closed and roped off, there was an old-fashioned fireplace now blazing with
birch logs. Three nuns sat on a sofa that was drawn up almost to the hearth
itself. They were talking and smiling with their bags stacked up to either side,
waiting for the check-out line to thin a little. As Wendy watched them they
burst into a chord of tinkling, girlish laughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) felt a smile touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) own
lips; not one of them could be under sixty.
In the background was the constant hum of conversation, the muted ding! of the
silver-plated bell beside the cash register as one of the two clerks on duty
struck it, the slightly impatient call of <div class="bookquote">``Front, please!''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerks</b></font>)</div>It brought back

<p/>strong, warm memories of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) honeymoon in New York with Jack, at the Beekman
Tower. For the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) let herself believe that this might be exactly
what the three of them needed: a season together away from the world, a sort of
family honeymoon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) smiled affectionately down at Danny, who was goggling
around frankly at everything. Another limo, as gray as a banker's vest, had
pulled up out front
<div class="bookquote">``The last day of the season,''  (<font color='red'><b>a banker</b></font>)</div>Ullman was saying. <div class="bookquote">``Closing day. Always hectic.
I had expected you more around three, Mr. Torrance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to give the Volks time for a nervous breakdown if it decided to have
one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``It didn't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How fortunate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman said. <div class="bookquote">``I'd like to take the three of you on a tour of
the place a little later, and of course Dick Hallorann wants to show Mrs.
Torrance the Overlook's kitchen. But I'm afraid --''
 (<font color='red'><b>the clerks</b></font>)</div>One of the clerks came over and almost tugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) forelock.
<div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, Mr. Ullman -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well? What is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's Mrs. Brant,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>the clerk said uncomfortably. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) refuses to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) bill
with anything but her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) American Express card. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) we stopped taking
American Express at the end of the season last year, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) won't ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)
eyes shifted to the Torrance family, then back to Ullman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) shrugged.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll take care of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mr. Ullman.''  (<font color='red'><b>The clerk</b></font>)</div>The clerk crossed back to the desk, where a
dreadnought of a woman bundled into a long fur coat and what looked like a black
feather boa was remonstrating loudly.
<div class="bookquote">``I have been coming to the Overlook Hotel since 1955,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was telling the
smiling, shrugging clerk. <div class="bookquote">``I continued to come even after my second husband died
of a stroke on that tiresome roque court -- I told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the sun was too hot that
day -- and I have never ... I repeat: never ... paid with anything but my
American Express credit card. Call the police if you like! Have them drag me
away! I will still refuse to pay with anything but my American Express credit
card. I repeat: ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Mr. Ullman said.
They watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) cross the lobby, touch Mrs. Brant's elbow deferentially, and
spread his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) hands and nod when she (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) tirade on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) listened
sympathetically, nodded again, and said something in return. Mrs. Brant smiled
triumphantly, turned to the unhappy desk clerk, and said loudly: <div class="bookquote">``Thank God
there is one employee of this hotel who hasn't become an utter Philistine!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the desk clerk</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) allowed Ullman, who barely came to the bulky shoulder of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) fur coat, to
take her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) arm and lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) away, presumably to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) inner office.
<div class="bookquote">``Whooo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``There's a dude who earns his (<font color='blue'><b>dude</b></font>) money.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>dude</b></font>) didn't like that lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said immediately. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>dude</b></font>) was just
pretending to like her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack grinned down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure that's true, doc. But flattery is the
stuff that greases the wheels of the world.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's flattery?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Flattery,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is when your daddy says he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) likes my new yellow
slacks even if he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) doesn't or when he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) says I don't need to take off five pounds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh. Is it lying for fun?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something very like that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) closely and now said: <div class="bookquote">``You're pretty, Mommy.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
frowned in confusion when they exchanged a glance and then burst into laughter.
<div class="bookquote">``Ullman didn't waste much flattery on me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``Come on over by the
window, you guys. I feel conspicuous standing out here in the middle with my
denim jacket on. I honest to God didn't think there'd be anybody much here on
closing day. Guess I was wrong.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You look very handsome,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, and then they laughed again, Wendy putting
a hand over her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mouth. Danny still didn't understand, but it was okay. They were
loving each other. Danny thought this place reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) of somewhere else
-LRB-the beak-man place-RRB-
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had been happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) liked it as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) did, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
kept telling himself over and over that the things Tony showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) didn't always
come true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) would be careful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) would watch for something called Redrum. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) would not say anything unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) absolutely had to. Because they were happy,
they had been laughing, and there were no bad thoughts.
<div class="bookquote">``Look at this view,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's gorgeous! Danny, look!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>But Danny didn't think it was particularly gorgeous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't like heights;
they made him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) dizzy. Beyond the wide front porch, which ran the length of the
hotel, a beautifully manicured lawn -LRB-there was a putting green on the right-RRB-
sloped away to a long, rectangular swimming pool. A CLOSED sign stood on a
little tripod at one end of the pool; closed was one sign he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could read by
himself, along with Stop, Exit, Pizza, and a few others.
Beyond the pool a graveled path wound off through baby pines and spruces and
aspens. Here was a small sign he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't know: ROQUE. There was an arrow below
it.
<div class="bookquote">``What's R-O-Q-U-E, Daddy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A game,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daddy</b></font>)</div>Daddy said. <div class="bookquote">``It's a little bit like croquet, only you play it on a
gravel court that has sides like a big billiard table instead of grass. It's a
very old game, Danny. Sometimes they have tournaments here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you play it with a croquet mallet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack agreed. <div class="bookquote">``Only the handle's a little shorter and the head has
two sides. One side is hard rubber and the other side is wood.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Come out, you little shit!-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``It's pronounced roke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daddy</b></font>)</div>Daddy was saying. <div class="bookquote">``I'll teach you how to play, if you
want.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said in an odd colorless little voice that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) parents
exchange a puzzled look over his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I might not like it, though.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well if you don't like it, doc, you don't have to play. All right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you like the animals?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy asked. <div class="bookquote">``That's called a topiary.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Beyond the
path leading to roque there were hedges clipped into the shapes of various
animals. Danny, whose eyes were sharp, made out a rabbit, a dog, a horse, a cow,
and a trio of bigger ones that looked like frolicking lions.
<div class="bookquote">``Those animals were what made Uncle Al think of me for the job,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) knew that when I was in college I used to work for a landscaping
company. That's a business that fixes people's lawns and bushes and hedges. I

<p/>used to trim a lady's topiary.''
Wendy put a hand over her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mouth and snickered. Looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), Jack said,
``Yes, I used to trim her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) topiary at least once a week''
``Get away, fly,'' Wendy said, and snickered again.
``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) have nice hedges, Dad?'' Danny asked, and at this they both stifled
great bursts of laughter. Wendy laughed so hard that tears streamed down her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
cheeks and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had to get a Kleenex out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) handbag.
``They weren't animals, Danny,'' Jack said when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had control of himself. ``They
were playing cards. Spades and hearts and clubs and diamonds. But the hedges
grow, you see -- ''
-LRB-They creep, Watson had said ... no, not the hedges, the boiler. You have to
watch it all the time or you and your fambly will end up on the fuckin moon.-RRB-
They looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>), puzzled. The smile had faded off his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) face.
``Dad?'' Danny asked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) blinked at them, as if coming back from far away. ``They grow, Danny, and
lose their shape. So I'll have to give them a haircut once or twice a week until
it gets so cold they stop growing for the year.''
``And a playground, too,'' Wendy said. ``My lucky boy.''
The playground was beyond the topiary. Two slides, a big swing set with half a
dozen swings set at varying heights, a jungle gym, a tunnel made of cement
rings, a sandbox, and a playhouse that was an exact replica of the Overlook
itself.
``Do you like it, Danny?'' Wendy asked.
``I sure do,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said, hoping he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sounded more enthused than he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) felt. ``It's
neat.''
Beyond the playground there was an inconspicuous chain link security fence,
beyond that the wide, macadamized drive that led up to the hotel, and beyond
that the valley itself, dropping away into the bright blue haze of afternoon.
Danny didn't know the word isolation, but if someone had explained it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
would have seized on it. Far below, lying in the sun like a long black snake
that had decided to snooze for a while, was the road that led back through
Sidewinder Pass and eventually to Boulder. The road that would be closed all
winter long. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) felt a little suffocated at the thought, and almost jumped when
Daddy dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shoulder.
``I'll get you that drink as soon as I can, doc. They're a little busy right
now.''
<div class="bookquote">``Sure, Dad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Brant came out of the inner office looking vindicated. A few moments
later two bellboys, struggling with eight suitcases between them, followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>)
as best they could as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) strode triumphantly out the door. Danny watched
through the window as a man in a gray uniform and a hat like a captain in the
Army brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) long silver car around to the door and got out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
cap to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) and ran around to open the trunk.
And in one of those flashes that sometimes came, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) got a complete thought
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>), one that floated above the confused, low-pitched babble of emotions
and colors that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) usually got in crowded places.
-LRB-i' d like to get into his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pants-RRB-
Danny's brow wrinkled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) watched the bellboys put her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) cases into the trunk.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) was looking rather sharply at the man in the gray uniform, who was
supervising the loading. Why would she (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) want to get that man's pants? Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>)
cold, even with that long fur coat on? And if she (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) was that cold, why hadn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>)
just put on some pants of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) own? His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mommy wore pants just about all winter.
The man in the gray uniform closed the trunk and walked back to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) into
the car. Danny watched closely to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) would say anything about his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pants,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) only smiled and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) a dollar bill -- a tip. A moment later she (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) was
guiding the big silver car down the driveway.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thought about asking his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother why Mrs. Brant might want the car-man's
pants, and decided against it. Sometimes questions could get you in a whole lot
of trouble. It had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) before.
So instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) squeezed in between them on the small sofa they were sharing and
watched all the people check out at the desk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was glad his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mommy and daddy
were happy and loving each other, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) couldn't help being a little worried.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) couldn't help it.

HALLORANN
The cook didn't conform to Wendy's image of the typical resort hotel kitchen
personage at all. To begin with, such a personage was called a chef, nothing so
mundane as a cook -- cooking was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) did in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) apartment kitchen when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
threw all the leftovers into a greased Pyrex casserole dish and added noodles.
Further, the culinary wizard of such a place as the Overlook, which advertised
in the resort section of the New York Sunday Times, should be small, rotund, and
pasty-faced -LRB-rather like the Pillsbury Dough-Boy-RRB-; he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) should have a thin pencilline mustache like a forties musical comedy star, dark eyes, a French accent,
and a detestable personality.
Hallorann had the dark eyes and that was all. He (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) was a tall black man with a
modest afro that was beginning to powder white. He (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) had a soft southern accent
and he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) laughed a lot, disclosing teeth too white and too even to be anything but
1950-vintage Sears and Roebuck dentures. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) own father had had a pair, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
called Roebuckers, and from time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would push them out at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) comically
at the supper table ... always, Wendy remembered now, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother was out
in the kitchen getting something else or on the telephone.
Danny had stared up at this black giant in blue serge, and then had smiled
when Hallorann picked him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) up easily, set him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) in the crook of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) elbow, and
said: <div class="bookquote">``You ain't gonna stay up here all winter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the crook</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said with a shy grin.
<div class="bookquote">``No, you're gonna come down to St. Pete's with me and learn to cook and go out
on the beach every damn evenin watchin for crabs. Right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div><p/>Danny giggled delightedly and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head no. Hallorann set him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) down.
<div class="bookquote">``If you're gonna change your mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, bending over him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) gravely,
<div class="bookquote">``you better do it quick. Thirty minutes from now and I'm in my car. Two and a
half hours after that, I'm sitting at Gate 32, Concourse B, Stapleton
International Airport, in the mile-high city of Denver, Colorado. Three hours
after that, I'm rentin a car at the Miama Airport and on my way to sunny St.
Pete's, waiting to get iota my swimtrunks and just laaafin up my sleeve at
anybody stuck and caught in the snow. Can you dig it, my boy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said, smiling.
Hallorann turned to Jack and Wendy. <div class="bookquote">``Looks like a fine boy there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We think he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said, and offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hand. Hallorann took it. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
Jack Torrance. My wife Winnifred. Danny you've met.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And a pleasure it was. Ma'am, are you a Winnie or a Freddie?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm a Wendy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) said, smiling.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay. That's better than the other two, I think. Right this way. Mr. Ullman
wants you to have the tour, the tour you'll get.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) bead and said
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) breath: <div class="bookquote">``And won't I be glad to see the last of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Hallorann commenced to tour them around the most immense kitchen Wendy had
ever seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) life. It was sparkling clean. Every surface was coaxed to a
high gloss. It was more than just big; it was intimidating. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) walked at
Hallorann's side while Jack, wholly out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) element, hung back a little with
Danny. A long wallboard hung with cutting instruments which went all the way
from paring knives to twohanded cleavers hung beside a four-basin sink. There
was a breadboard as big as their Boulder apartment's kitchen table. An amazing
array of stainless-steel pots and pans hung from floor to ceiling, covering one
whole wall.
<div class="bookquote">``I think I'll have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs every time I come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>)
said.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't let it get you down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. ``It's big, but it's still only a
kitchen. Most of this stuff you'll never even have to touch. Keep it clean,
that's all I ask. Here's the stove I'd be using, if I was you. There are three
of them in all, but this is the smallest.
Smallest, she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) thought dismally, looking at it There were twelve burners, two
regular ovens and a Dutch oven, a heated well on top in which you could simmer
sauces or bake beans, a broiler, and a warmer -- plus a million dials and
temperature gauges.
``All gas,'' Hallorann said. ``You've cooked with gas before, Wendy?''
``Yes.. ''
``I love gas,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said, and turned on one of the burners. Blue flame popped
into life and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) adjusted it down to a faint glow with a delicate touch. ``I like
to be able to see the flame you're cookin with. You see where all the surface
burner switches are?''
``Yes.''
``And the oven dials are all marked. Myself, I favor the middle one because it
seems to heat the most even, but you use whichever one you like -- or all three,
for that matter.''
``A TV dinner in each one,'' Wendy said, and laughed weakly.
Hallorann roared. ``Go right ahead, if you like. I left a list of everything

<p/>edible over by the sink. You see it?''
``Here it is, Mommy!'' Danny brought over two sheets of paper, written closely
on both sides.
``Good boy,'' Hallorann said, taking it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and ruffling his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hair. ``You
sure you don't want to come to Florida with me, my boy? Learn to cook the
sweetest shrimp creole this side of paradise?''
Danny put his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth and giggled and retreated to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father's
side.
``You three folks could eat up here for a year, I guess,'' Hallorann said. ``We
got a cold-pantry, a walk-in freezer, all sorts of vegetable bins, and two
refrigerators. Come on and let me show you.''
For the next ten minutes Hallorann opened bins and doors, disclosing food in
such amounts as Wendy had never seen before. The food supplies amazed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) but
did not reassure her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) might have thought: the Donner Party kept
recurring to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), not with thoughts of cannibalism -LRB-with all this food it would
indeed be a long time before they were reduced to such poor rations as each
other-RRB-, but with the reinforced idea that this was indeed a serious business:
when snow fell, getting out of here would not be a matter of an hour's drive to
Sidewinder but a major operation. They would sit up here in this deserted grand
hotel, eating the food that had been left them like creatures in a fairy tale
and listening to the bitter wind around their snowbound eaves. In Vermont, when
Danny had broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) arm
-LRB-when Jack broke Danny's arm-RRB-
she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had called the emergency Medix squad, dialing the number from the little
card attached to the phone. They had been at the house only ten minutes later.
There were other numbers written on that little card. You could have a police
car in five minutes and a fire truck in even less time than that, because the
fire station was only three blocks away and one block over. There was a man to
call if the lights went out, a man to call if the shower stopped up, a man to
call if the TV went on the fritz. But what would happen up here if Danny had one
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fainting spells and swallowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tongue?
-LRB-oh God what a thought!-RRB-
What if the place caught on fire? If Jack fell down the elevator shaft and
fractured his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) skull? What if -- ?
-LRB-what if we have a wonderful time now stop it, Winnifred!-RRB-
Hallorann showed them into the walk-in freezer first, where their breath
puffed out like comic strip balloons. In the freezer it was as if winter had
already come.
Hamburger in big plastic bags, ten pounds in each bag, a dozen bags. Forty
whole chickens hanging from a row of hooks in the wood-planked walls. Canned
hams stacked up like poker chips, a dozen of them. Below the chickens, ten
roasts of beef, ten roasts of pork, and a huge leg of lamb.
``You like lamb, doc?'' Hallorann asked, grinning.
``I love it,'' Danny said immediately. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had never had it.
``I knew you did. There's nothin like two good slices of lamb on a cold night,
with some mint jelly on the side. You got the mint jelly here, too. Lamb eases
the belly. It's a noncontentious sort of meat.''
From behind them Jack said curiously: <div class="bookquote">``How did you know we called him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamb</b></font>) doc?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div><p/>Hallorann turned around. <div class="bookquote">``Pardon?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Danny: We call him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) doc sometimes. Like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Looks sort of like a doc, doesn't be?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wrinkled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) nose at Danny, smacked
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lips, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Ehhhh, what's up, doc?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny giggled and then Hallorann said something
-LRB-Sure you don't want to go to Florida, doc?-RRB-
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), very clearly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) heard every word. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked at Hallorann, startled
and a little scared. Hallorann winked solemnly and turned back to the food.
Wendy looked from the cook's broad, serge-clad back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) son. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) had the
oddest feeling that something had passed between them, something she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) could not
quite follow.
<div class="bookquote">``You got twelve packages of sausage, twelve packages of bacon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann
said. <div class="bookquote">``So much for the pig. In this drawer, twenty pounds of butter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Real butter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack asked.
<div class="bookquote">``The A-number-one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I've had real butter since I was a kid back in Berlin, New
Hampshire.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, you'll eat it up here until oleo seems a treat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, and
laughed. ``Over in this bin you got your bread -- thirty loaves of white, twenty of
dark. We try to keep racial balance at the Overlook, don't you know. Now I know
fifty loaves won't take you through, but there's plenty of makings and fresh is
better than frozen any day of the week.
``Down here you got your fish. Brain food, right, doc?''
``Is it, Mom?''
``If Mr. Hallorann says so, honey.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) smiled.
Danny wrinkled his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) nose. ``I don't like fish.''
``You're dead wrong,'' Hallorann said. ``You just never had any fish that liked
you. This fish here will like you fine. Five pounds of rainbow trout, ten pounds
of turbot, fifteen cans of tuna fish -- ''
``Oh yeah, I like tuna.''
``and five pounds of the sweetest-tasting sole that ever swam in the sea. My
boy, when next spring rolls around, you're gonna thank old ...'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
fingers as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had forgotten something. ``What's my name, now? I guess it just
slipped my mind.''
``Mr. Hallorann,'' Danny said, grinning. ``Dick, to your friends.''
``That's right! And you bein a friend, you make it Dick.''
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) led them into the far corner, Jack and Wendy exchanged a puzzled glance,
both of them trying to remember if Hallorann had told them his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) first name.
``And this here I put in special,'' Hallorann said. ``Hope you folks enjoy it.''
``Oh really, you shouldn't have,'' Wendy said, touched. It was a twenty-pound
turkey wrapped in a wide scarlet ribbon with a bow on top.
``You got to have your turkey on Thanksgiving, Wendy,'' Hallorann said gravely.
``I believe there's a capon back here somewhere for Christmas. Doubtless you'll
stumble on it. Let's come on out of here now before we all catch the peenumonia.
Right, doc?''
<div class="bookquote">``Right!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There were more wonders in the cold-pantry. A hundred boxes of dried milk
-LRB-Hallorann advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) gravely to buy fresh milk for the boy in Sidewinder as

<p/>long as it was feasible-RRB-, five twelve-pound bags of sugar, a gallon jug of
blackstrap molasses, cereals, glass jugs of rice, macaroni, spaghetti; ranked
cans of fruit and fruit salad; a bushel of fresh apples that scented the whole
room with autumn; dried raisins, prunes, and apricots -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``You got to be regular if
you want to be happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, and pealed laughter at the coldpantry
ceiling, where one old-fashioned light globe hung down on an iron chain-RRB-; a deep
bin filled with potatoes; and smaller caches of tomatoes, onions, turnips,
squashes, and cabbages.
<div class="bookquote">``My word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said as they came out. But seeing all that fresh food after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thirty-dollar-a-week grocery budget so stunned her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was unable to
say just what her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) word was.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm runnin a bit late,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) watch, <div class="bookquote">``so I'll just let
you go through the cabinets and the fridges as you get settled in. There's
cheeses, canned milk, sweetened condensed milk, yeast, bakin soda, a whole
bagful of those Table Talk pies, a few bunches of bananas that ain't even near
to ripe yet -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) said, holding up a hand and laughing. <div class="bookquote">``I'll never remember it all.
It's super. And I promise to leave the place clean.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's all I ask.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) turned to Jack. <div class="bookquote">``Did Mr. Ullman give you the rundown on
the rats in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) belfry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack grinned. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) said there were possibly some in the attic, and Mr. Watson
said there might be some more down in the basement. There must be two tons of
paper down there, but I didn't see any shredded, as if they'd been using it to
make nests.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That Watson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head in mock sorrow. <div class="bookquote">``Ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) the
foulest-talking man you ever ran on?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>)'s quite a character,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack agreed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own father had been the foulesttalking man Jack had ever run on.
<div class="bookquote">``It's sort of a pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, leading them back toward the wide
swinging doors that gave on the Overlook dining room. <div class="bookquote">``There was money in that
family, long ago. It was Watson's granddad or great-granddad -- I can't remember
which -- that built this place.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So I was told,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said.
<div class="bookquote">``What happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, they couldn't make it go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. <div class="bookquote">``Watson will tell you the
whole story -- twice a day, if you let him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>). The old man got a bee in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bonnet
about the place. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let it drag him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down, I guess. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had two boys and one of
them was killed in a riding accident on the grounds while the hotel was still abuilding. That would have been 1908 or '09. The old man's wife died of the flu,
and then it was just the old man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) youngest son. They ended up getting
took back on as caretakers in the same hotel the old man had built.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is sort of a pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said.
<div class="bookquote">``What happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? The old man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack asked.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plugged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger into a light socket by mistake and that was the end of
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. ``Sometime in the early thirties before the Depression
closed this place down for ten years.
``Anyway, Jack, I'd appreciate it if you and your wife would keep an eye out
for rats in the kitchen, as well. If you should see them ... traps, not

<p/>poison.''
Jack blinked. ``Of course. Who'd want to put rat poison in the kitchen?''
Hallorann laughed derisively. ``Mr. Ullman, that's who. That was his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) bright
idea last fall. I put it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>), I said: `What if we all get up here next May,
Mr. Ullman, and I serve the traditional opening night dinner' -- which just
happens to be salmon in a very nice sauce -- `and everybody gits sick and the
doctor comes and says to you, <div class="bookquote">``Ullman, what have you been doing up here? You've
got eighty of the richest folks in America suffering from rat poisoning!''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>'''
Jack threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head back and bellowed laughter. ``What did Ullman say?''
Hallorann tucked his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) tongue into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) cheek as if feeling for a bit of food in
there. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) said: `Get some traps, Hallorann.' ''
This time they all laughed, even Danny, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was not completely sure
what the joke was, except it had something to do with Mr. Ullman, who didn't
know everything after all.
The four of them passed through the dining room, empty and silent now, with
its fabulous western exposure on the snow-dusted peaks. Each of the white linen
tablecloths had been covered with a sheet of tough clear plastic. The rug, now
rolled up for the season, stood in one corner like a sentinel on guard duty.
Across the wide room was a double set of batwing doors, and over them an oldfashioned sign lettered in gilt script: The Colorado Lounge.
Following his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) gaze, Hallorann said, ``If you're a drinkin man, I hope you
brought your own supplies. That place is picked clean. Employee's party last
night, you know. Every maid and bellhop in the place is goin around with a
headache today, me included.''
``I don't drink,'' Jack said shortly. They went back to the lobby.
It had cleared greatly during the half hour they'd spent in the kitchen. The
long main room was beginning to take on the quiet, deserted look that Jack
supposed they would become familiar with soon enough. The high-backed chairs
were empty. The nuns who had been sitting by the fire were gone, and the fire
itself was down to a bed of comfortably glowing coals. Wendy glanced out into
the parking lot and saw that all but a dozen cars had disappeared.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) found herself wishing they could get back in the VW and go back to
Boulder... or anywhere else.
Jack was looking around for Ullman, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) wasn't in the lobby.
A young maid with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) ash-blond hair pinned up on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) neck came over. ``Your
luggage is out on the porch, Dick.''
``Thank you, Sally.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) a peck on the forehead. ``You have yourself a
good winter. Getting married, I hear.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) turned to the Torrances as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) strolled away, backside twitching pertly.
``I've got to hurry along if I'm going to make that plane. I want to wish you all
the best. Know you'll have it.''
``Thanks,'' Jack said. ``You've been very kind.''
``I'll take good care of your kitchen,'' Wendy promised again. ``Enjoy Florida.''
``I always do,'' Hallorann said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knees and bent down to
Danny. ``Last chance, guy. Want to come to Florida?''
``I guess not,'' Danny said, smiling.
``Okay. Like to give me a hand out to my car with my bags?''
<div class="bookquote">``If my mommy says I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said, <div class="bookquote">``but you'll have to have that jacket buttoned.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
leaned forward to do it but Hallorann was ahead of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) large brown fingers
moving with smooth dexterity.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll send him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) right back in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said.
<div class="bookquote">``Fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said, and followed them to the door. Jack was still looking
around for Ullman. The last of the Overlooks guests were checking out at the
desk.

<p/><< 11 >>
THE SHINING
There were four bags in a pile just outside the door. Three of them were
giant, battered old suitcases covered with black imitation alligator hide. The
last was an oversized zipper bag with a faded tartan skin.
<div class="bookquote">``Guess you can handle that one, can't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) picked up
two of the big cases in one hand and hoisted the other under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) arm.
<div class="bookquote">``Sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) got a grip on it with both hands and followed the cook
down the porch steps, trying manfully not to grunt and give away how heavy it
was.
A sharp and cutting fall wind had come up since they had arrived; it whistled
across the parking lot, making Danny wince his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes down to slits as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) carried
the zipper bag in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), bumping on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knees. A few errant aspen leaves
rattled and turned across the now mostly deserted asphalt, making Danny think
momentarily of that night last week when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had wakened out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) nightmare and
had heard -- or thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) heard, at least -- Tony telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) not to go.
Hallorann set his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) bags down by the trunk of a beige Plymouth Fury. <div class="bookquote">``This ain't
much car,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) confided to Danny, <div class="bookquote">``just a rental job. My Bessie's on the other
end. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>)'s a car. 1950 Cadillac, and does she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) run sweet? I'll tell the world. I
keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) in Florida because she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>)'s too old for all this mountain climbing. You
need a hand with that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) managed to carry it the last ten or twelve steps
without grunting and set it down with a large sigh of relief.
<div class="bookquote">``Good boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) produced a large key ring from the pocket of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) blue serge jacket and unlocked the trunk. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lifted the bags in he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said:
<div class="bookquote">``You shine on, boy. Harder than anyone I ever met in my life. And I'm sixty
years old this January.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Huh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You got a knack,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, turning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Me, I've always called it
shining. That's what my grandmother called it, too. She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) had it. We used to sit
in the kitchen when I was a boy no older than you and have long talks without
even openin our mouths.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann smiled at Danny's openmouthed, almost hungry expression and said,
<div class="bookquote">``Come on up and sit in the car with me for a few minutes. Want to talk to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) slammed the trunk.
In the lobby of the Overlook, Wendy Torrance saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) son get into the
passenger side of Hallorann's car as the big black cook slid in behind the
wheel. A sharp pang of fear struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) mouth to tell Jack
that Hallorann had not been lying about taking their son to Florida -- there was a
kidnaping afoot. But they were only sitting there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) could barely see the
small silhouette of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) son's head, turned attentively toward Hallorann's big
one. Even at this distance that small head had a set to it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) recognized --
it was the way her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) son looked when there was something on the TV that
particularly fascinated him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), or when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father were playing old maid or
idiot cribbage. Jack, who was still looking around for Ullman, hadn't noticed.
Wendy kept silent, watching Hallorann's car nervously, wondering what they could
possibly be talking about that would make Danny cock his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head that way.
In the car Hallorann was saying: <div class="bookquote">``Get you kinda lonely, thinkin you were the
only one?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny, who had been frightened as well as lonely sometimes, nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Am I the
only one you ever met?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) asked.
Hallorann laughed and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``No, child, no. But you shine the
hardest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are there lots, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, <div class="bookquote">``but you do run across them. A lot of folks, they got a
little bit of shine to them. They don't even know it. But they always seem to
show up with flowers when their wives are feelin blue with the monthlies, they
do good on school tests they don't even study for, they got a good idea how
people are feelin as soon as they walk into a room. I come across fifty or sixty
like that. But maybe only a dozen, countin my gram, that knew they was shinin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said, and thought about it. Then: <div class="bookquote">``Do you know Mrs. Brant?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann asked scornfully. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) don't shine. Just sends her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) supper
back two-three times every night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) doesn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``But do you know the man in the
gray uniform that gets the cars?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mike? Sure, I know Mike. What about him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hallorann, why would she (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) want his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) pants?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What are you talking about, boy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) was thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>) would sure like to get
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) pants and I just wondered why -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) got no further. Hallorann had thrown his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head back, and rich, dark
laughter issued from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) chest, rolling around in the car like cannonfire. The
seat shook with the force of it. Danny smiled, puzzled, and at last the storm
subsided by fits and starts. Hallorann produced a large silk handkerchief from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) breast pocket like a white flag of surrender and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) streaming eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said, still snorting a little, <div class="bookquote">``you are gonna know everything there
is to know about the human condition before you make ten. I dunno if to envy you

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But Mrs. Brant -- ''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Brant</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And don't go askin your mom, either. You'd
only upset her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>), dig what I'm sayin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) dug it perfectly well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had upset his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother that
way in the past.
<div class="bookquote">``That Mrs. Brant is just a dirty old woman with an itch, that's all you have
to know.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked at Danny speculatively. <div class="bookquote">``How hard can you hit, doc?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Huh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Give me a blast. Think at me. I want to know if you got as much as I think
you do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do you want me to think?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anything. Just think it hard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) considered it for a moment, then gathered his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
concentration and flung it out at Hallorann. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had never done anything
precisely like this before, and at the last instant some instinctive part of him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
rose up and blunted some of the thought's raw force-he didn't want to hurt Mr.
Hallorann. Still the thought arrowed out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) with a force he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) never would have
believed. It went like a Nolan Ryan fastball with a little extra on it.
-LRB-Gee I hope I don't hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Ryan</b></font>)-RRB-
And the thought was:
-LRB-!!! HI, DICK!!!-RRB-
Hallorann winced and jerked backward on the seat. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ryan</b></font>) teeth came together
with a hard click, drawing blood from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ryan</b></font>) lower lip in a thin trickle. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ryan</b></font>) hands
flew up involuntarily from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ryan</b></font>) lap to the level of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ryan</b></font>) chest and then settled
back again. For a moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Ryan</b></font>) eyelids fluttered limply, with no conscious
control, and Danny was frightened.
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hallorann? Dick? Are you okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, and laughed weakly. <div class="bookquote">``I honest to God don't. My
God, boy, you're a pistol.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said, more alarmed. <div class="bookquote">``Should I get my daddy? I'll run and
get him (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, here I come. I'm okay, Danny. You just sit right there. I feel a little
scrambled, that's all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I didn't go as hard as I could,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny confessed. <div class="bookquote">``I was scared to, at the
last minute.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Probably my good luck you did ... my brains would be leakin out my ears.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) saw the alarm on Danny's face and smiled. <div class="bookquote">``No harm done. What did it feel
like to you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Like I was Nolan Ryan throwing a fastball,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) replied promptly.
<div class="bookquote">``You like baseball, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann was rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) temples gingerly.
<div class="bookquote">``Daddy and me like the Angels,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. <div class="bookquote">``The Red Sox in the American
League East and the Angels in the West. We saw the Red Sox against Cincinnati in
the World Series. I was a lot littler then. And Daddy was ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny's face
went dark and troubled.
<div class="bookquote">``Was what, Dan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I forget,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) started to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thumb in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth to suck it,
but that was a baby trick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lap.
<div class="bookquote">``Can you tell what your mom and dad are thinking, Danny?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann was
watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) closely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most times, if I want to. But usually I don't try.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well ...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) paused a moment, troubled. <div class="bookquote">``It would be like peeking into the
bedroom and watching while they're doing the thing that makes babies. Do you
know that thing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have had acquaintance with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said gravely.
<div class="bookquote">``They wouldn't like that. And they wouldn't like me peeking at their thinks.
It would be dirty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I know how they're feeling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. <div class="bookquote">``I can't help that. I know how
you're feeling, too. I hurt you. I'm sorry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's just a headache. I've had hangovers that were worse. Can you read other
people, Danny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't read yet at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said, <div class="bookquote">``except a few words. But Daddy's going
to teach me this winter. My daddy used to teach reading and writing in a big
school. Mostly writing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knows reading, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I mean, can you tell what anybody is thinking?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny thought about it.
<div class="bookquote">``I can if it's loud,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said finally. <div class="bookquote">``Like Mrs. Brant and the pants. Or like
once, when me and Mommy were in this big store to get me some shoes, there was
this big kid looking at radios, and he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) was thinking about taking one without
buying it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>)'d think, what if I get caught? Then he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>)'d think, I really want
it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>)'d think about getting caught again. He (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) was making himself sick about
it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) was making me sick. Mommy was talking to the man who sells the shoes
so I went over and said, `Kid, don't take that radio. Go away.' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Kid</b></font>) got
really scared. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kid</b></font>) went away fast.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann was grinning broadly. <div class="bookquote">``I bet he (<font color='blue'><b>Kid</b></font>) did. Can you do anything else,
Danny? Is it only thoughts and feelings, or is there more?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Cautiously: <div class="bookquote">``Is there more for you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. <div class="bookquote">``Not often. Sometimes ... sometimes there are
dreams. Do you dream, Danny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said, <div class="bookquote">``I dream when I'm awake. After Tony comes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thumb
wanted to go into his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had never told anyone but Mommy and Daddy
about Tony. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) thumb-sucking hand go back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) lap.
<div class="bookquote">``Who's Tony?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>And suddenly Danny had one of those flashes of understanding that frightened
him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) most of all; it was like a sudden glimpse of some incomprehensible machine
that might be safe or might be deadly dangerous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was too young to know which.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was too young to understand.
<div class="bookquote">``What's wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``You're asking me all this because you're worried,
aren't you? Why are you worried about me? Why are you worried about us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann put his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) large dark hands on the small boy's shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``Stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``It's probably nothin. But if it is somethin ... well, you've got a large
thing in your head, Danny. You'll have to do a lot of growin yet before you
catch up to it, I guess. You got to be brave about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I don't understand things!''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny burst out. <div class="bookquote">``I do but I don't! People ... they feel things and I
feel them, but I don't know what I'm feeling!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lap wretchedly. ``I wish I could read. Sometimes Tony shows me

<p/>signs and I can hardly read any of them.''
``Who's Tony?'' Hallorann asked again.
``Mommy and Daddy call him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) my `invisible playmate, ''' Danny said, reciting the
words carefully. ``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)'s really real. At least, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) is. Sometimes, when
I try real hard to understand things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) comes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) says, `Danny, I want to show
you something.' And it's like I pass out. Only ... there are dreams, like you
said.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked at Hallorann and swallowed. ``They used to be nice. But now ... I can't remember
the word for dreams that scare you and make you cry.''
``Nightmares?'' Hallorann asked.
``Yes. That's right. Nightmares.''
``About this place? About the Overlook?''
Danny looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thumb-sucking hand again. ``Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) whispered. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) spoke shrilly, looking up into Hallorann's face: ``But I can't tell my daddy,
and you can't, either! He (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) has to have this job because it's the only one Uncle
Al could get for him (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) has to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) play or he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) might start doing the
Bad Thing again and I know what that is, it's getting drunk, that's what it is,
it's when he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) used to always be drunk and that was a Bad Thing to do!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
stopped, on the verge of tears.
``Shh,'' Hallorann said, and pulled Danny's face against the rough serge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
jacket. It smelled faintly of mothballs. ``That's all right, son. And if that
thumb likes your mouth, let it go where it wants.'' But his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face was troubled.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said: ``What you got, son, I call it shinin on, the Bible calls it having
visions, and there's scientists that call it precognition. I've read up on it,
son. I've studied on it. They all mean seeing the future. Do you understand
that?''
Danny nodded against Hallorann's coat.
``I remember the strongest shine I ever had that way ... I'm not liable to
forget. It was 1955. I was still in the Army then, stationed overseas in West
Germany. It was an hour before supper, and I was standin by the sink, givin one
of the KPs hell for takin too much of the potato along with the peel. I says,
`Here, lemme show you how that's done.' He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) held out the potato and the peeler
and then the whole kitchen was gone. Bang, just like that. You say you see this
guy Tony before ... before you have dreams?''
Danny nodded.
Hallorann put an arm around him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). ``With me it's smellin oranges. All that
afternoon I'd been smellin them and thinkin nothin of it, because they were on
the menu for that night--we had thirty crates of Valencias. Everybody in the damn
kitchen was smellin oranges that night.
``For a minute it was like I had just passed out. And then I heard an explosion
and saw flames. There were people screaming. Sirens. And I heard this hissin
noise that could only be steam. Then it seemed like I got a little closer to
whatever it was and I saw a railroad car off the tracks and laying on its side
with Georgia aced South Carolina Railroad written on it, and I knew like a flash
that my brother Carl was on that train and it jumped the tracks and Carl was
dead. Just like that. Then it was gone and here's this scared, stupid little KP
in front of me, still holdin out that potato and the peeler. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carl</b></font>) says, `Are you
okay, Sarge?' And I says, `No. My brother's just been killed down in Georgia'
And when I finally got my momma on the overseas telephone, she (<font color='blue'><b>momma</b></font>) told me how it

<p/>was.
<div class="bookquote">``But see, boy, I already knew how it was.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head slowly, as if dismissing the memory, and looked down at the
wide-eyed boy.
<div class="bookquote">``But the thing you got to remember, my boy, is this: Those things don't always
come true. I remember just four years ago I had a job cookin at a boys' camp up
in Maine on Long Lake. So I am sittin by the boarding gate at Logan Airport in
Boston, just waiting to get on my flight, and I start to smell oranges. For the
first time in maybe five years. So I say to myself, `My God, what's comin on
this crazy late show now?' and I got down to the bathroom and sat on one of the
toilets to be private. I never did black out, but I started to get this feelin,
stronger and stronger, that my plane was gonna crash. Then the feeling went
away, and the smell of oranges, and I knew it was over. I went back to the Delta
Airlines desk and changed my flight to one three hours later. And do you know
what happened?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny whispered.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, and laughed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was relieved to see the boy smile a
little, too. <div class="bookquote">``Not one single thing! That old plane landed right on time and
without a single bump or bruise. So you see ... sometimes those feelins don't
come to anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said.
<div class="bookquote">``Or you take the race track. I go a lot, and I usually do pretty well. I stand
by the rail when they go by the starting gate, and sometimes I get a little
shine about this horse or that one. Usually those feelins help me get real well.
I always tell myself that someday I'm gonna get three at once on three long
shots and make enough on the trifecta to retire early. It ain't happened yet.
But there's plenty of times I've come home from the track on shank's mare
instead of in a taxicab with my wallet swollen up. Nobody shines on all the
time, except maybe for God up in heaven.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said, thinking of the time almost a year ago when Tony had
showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) a new baby lying in a crib at their house in Stovington. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) had been
very excited about that, and had waited, knowing that it took time, but there
had been no new baby.
<div class="bookquote">``Now you listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, and took both of Danny's hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) own.
<div class="bookquote">``I've had some bad dreams here, and I've had some bad feelins. I've worked here
two seasons now and maybe a dozen times I've had ... well, nightmares. And
maybe half a dozen times I've thought I've seen things. No, I won't say what. It
ain't for a little boy like you. Just nasty things. Once it had something to do
with those damn hedges clipped to look like animals. Another time there was a
maid, Delores Vickery her (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) name was, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) had a little shine to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>), but I
don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) knew it. Mr. Ullman fired her (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) ... do you know what that is,
doc?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said candidly, <div class="bookquote">``my daddy got fired from his (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) teaching job and
that's why we're in Colorado, I guess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, Ullman fired her (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>)'d seen something in one
of the rooms where ... well, where a bad thing happened. That was in Room 217,
and I want you to promise me you won't go in there, Danny. Not all winter. Steer
right clear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. <div class="bookquote">``Did the lady -- the maiden -- did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ask you to go
look?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did. And there was a bad thing there. But ... I don't think it was
a bad thing that could hurt anyone, Danny, that's what I'm tryin to say. People
who shine can sometimes see things that are gonna happen, and I think sometimes
they can see things that did happen. But they're just like pictures in a book.
Did you ever see a picture in a book that scared you, Danny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said, thinking of the story of Bluebeard and the picture where
Bluebeard's new wife opens the door and sees all the heads.
<div class="bookquote">``But you knew it couldn't hurt you, didn't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ye -- ess...''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said, a little dubious.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, that's how it is in this hotel. I don't know why, but it seems that all
the bad things that ever happened here, there's little pieces of those things
still layin around like fingernail clippins or the boogers that somebody nasty
just wiped under a chair. I don't know why it should just be here, there's bad
goings-on in just about every hotel in the world, I guess, and I've worked in a
lot of them and had no trouble. Only here. But Danny, I don't think those things
can hurt anybody.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) emphasized each word in the sentence with a mild shake of
the boy's shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``So if you should see something, in a hallway or a room or
outside by those hedges ... just look the other way and when you look back,
it'll be gone. Are you diggin me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) felt much better, soothed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) got up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knees,
kissed Hallorann's cheek, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) a big hard hug. Hallorann hugged him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
back.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) released the boy he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) asked: <div class="bookquote">``Your folks, they don't shine, do they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't think so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I tried them like I did you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. <div class="bookquote">``Your momma jumped the tiniest
bit. I think all mothers shine a little, you know, at least until their kids
grow up enough to watch out for themselves. Your dad ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann paused momentarily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had probed at the boy's father and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) just
didn't know. It wasn't like meeting someone who had the shine, or someone who
definitely did not. Poking at Danny's father had been ... strange, as if Jack
Torrance had something -- something that he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) was hiding. Or something he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) was holding in so deeply
submerged in himself that it was impossible to get to.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) shines at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann finished. <div class="bookquote">``So you don't worry
about them. You just take care of you. I don't think there's anything here that
can hurt you. So just be cool, okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Danny! Hey, doc!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny looked around. <div class="bookquote">``That's Mom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) wants me. I have to go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. <div class="bookquote">``You have a good time here, Danny. Best you
can, anyway.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will. Thanks, Mr. Hallorann. I feel a lot better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The smiling thought came in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind:
-LRB-Dick, to my friends-RRB- -LRB-Yes, Dick, okay-RRB-
Their eyes met, and Dick Hallorann winked.
Danny scrambled across the seat of the car and opened the passenger side door.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was getting out, Hallorann said, <div class="bookquote">``Danny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If there Is trouble ... you give a call. A big loud holler like the one you
gave a few minutes ago. I might hear you even way down in Florida. And if I do,
I'll come on the run.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said, and smiled.
<div class="bookquote">``You take care, big boy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny slammed the door and ran across the parking lot toward the porch, where
Wendy stood holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) elbows against the chill wind. Hallorann watched, the
big grin slowly fading.
I don't think there's anything here that can hurt you.
I don't think.
But what if he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was wrong? He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had known that this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) last season at the
Overlook ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had seen that thing in the bathtub of Room 217. It had
been worse than any picture in any book, and from here the boy running to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
mother looked so small ...
I don't think --
His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes drifted down to the topiary animals.
Abruptly he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) started the car and put it in gear and drove away, trying not to
look back. And of course he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did, and of course the porch was empty. They had
gone back inside. It was as if the Overlook had swallowed them.

<p/><< 12 >>
THE GRAND TOUR
<div class="bookquote">``What were you talking about, hon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy asked him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as they went back inside.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``For nothing much it sure was a long talk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shrugged and Wendy saw Danny's paternity in the gesture; Jack could hardly
have done it better himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would get no more out of Danny. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) felt strong
exasperation mixed with an even stronger love: the love was helpless, the
exasperation came from a feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was deliberately being excluded. With
the two of them around she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sometimes felt like an outsider, a bit player who had
accidentally wandered back onstage while the main action was taking place. Well,
they wouldn't be able to exclude her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) this winter, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) two exasperating males;
quarters were going to be a little too close for that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) suddenly realized she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
was feeling jealous of the closeness between her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) son, and felt
ashamed. That was too close to the way her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) own mother might have felt ... too
close for comfort.
The lobby was now empty except for Ullman and the head desk clerk -LRB-they were
at the register, cashing up-RRB-, a couple of maids who had changed to warm slacks

<p/>and sweaters, standing by the front door and looking out with their luggage
pooled around them, and Watson, the maintenance man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) a wink ... a decidedly lecherous one. She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) looked away
hurriedly. Jack was over by the window just outside the restaurant, studying the
view. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) looked rapt and dreamy.
The cash register apparently checked out, because now Ullman ran it shut with
an authoritative snap. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) initialed the tape and put it in a small zipper case.
Wendy silently applauded the head clerk, who looked greatly relieved. Ullman
looked like the type of man who might take any shortage out of the head clerk's
hide ... without ever spilling a drop of blood. Wendy didn't much care for
Ullman or his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) officious, ostentatiously bustling manner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) was like every boss
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)'d ever had, male or female. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) would be saccharin sweet with the guests, a
petty tyrant when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) was backstage with the help. But now school was out and the
head clerk's pleasure was written large on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) face. It was out for everyone but
she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) and Jack and Danny, anyway.
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Torrance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman called peremptorily. <div class="bookquote">``Would you come over here, please?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack walked over, nodding to Wendy and Danny that they were to come too.
The clerk, who had gone into the back, now came out again wearing an overcoat.
<div class="bookquote">``Have a pleasant winter, Mr. Ullman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I doubt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman said distantly. <div class="bookquote">``May twelfth, Braddock. Not a day
earlier. Not a day later.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Braddock</b></font>)</div>Braddock walked around the desk, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) face sober and dignified, as befitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)
position, but when his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) back was entirely to Ullman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) grinned like a schoolboy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) spoke briefly to the two girls still waiting by the door for their ride, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) was followed out by a brief burst of stifled laughter.
Now Wendy began to notice the silence of the place. It had fallen over the
hotel like a heavy blanket muting everything but the faint pulse of the
afternoon wind outside. From where she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stood she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could look through the inner
office, now neat to the point of sterility with its two bare desks and two sets
of gray filing cabinets. Beyond that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could see Hallorann's spotless kitchen,
the big portholed double doors propped open by rubber wedges.
<div class="bookquote">``I thought I would take a few extra minutes and show you through the Hotel,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman said, and Wendy reflected that you could always hear that capital H in
Ullman's voice. You were supposed to hear it. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure your husband will get to
know the ins and outs of the Overlook quite well, Mrs. Torrance, but you and
your son will doubtless keep more to the lobby level and the first floor, where
your quarters are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Doubtless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy murmured demurely, and Jack shot her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) a private glance.
<div class="bookquote">``It's a beautiful place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman said expansively. <div class="bookquote">``I rather enjoy showing it
off.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'll bet you do, Wendy thought.
<div class="bookquote">``Let's go up to third and work our way down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) sounded
positively enthused.
<div class="bookquote">``If we're keeping you -- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack began.
<div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman said: ``The shop is shut. Tout fins, for this season, at
least. And I plan to overnight in Boulder -- at the Boulderado, of course. Only
decent hotel this side of Denver ... except for the Overlook itself, of

<p/>course. This way.''
They stepped into the elevator together. It was ornately scrolled in copper
and brass, but it settled appreciably before Ullman pulled the gate across.
Danny stirred a little uneasily, and Ullman smiled down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>). Danny tried to
smile back without notable success.
``Don't you worry, little man,'' Ullman said. ``Safe as houses.''
``So was the Titanic,'' Jack said, looking up at the cut-glass globe in the
center of the elevator ceiling. Wendy bit the inside of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cheek to keep the
smile away.
Ullman was not amused. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) slid the inner gate across with a rattle and a bang.
``The Titanic made only one voyage, Mr. Torrance. This elevator has made
thousands of them since it was installed in 1926.''
``That's reassuring,'' Jack said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ruffed Danny's hair. ``The plane ain't gonna
crash, doc.''
Ullman threw the lever over, and for a moment there was nothing but a
shuddering beneath their feet and the tortured whine of the motor below them.
Wendy had a vision of the four of them being trapped between floors like flies
in a bottle and found in the spring ... with little bits and pieces gone ...
like the Donner Party ...
-LRB-Stop it!-RRB-
The elevator began to rise, with some vibration and clashing and banging from
below at first. Then the ride smoothed out. At the third floor Ullman brought
them to a bumpy stop, retracted the gate, and opened the door. The elevator car
was still six inches below floor level. Danny gazed at the difference in height
between the third-floor hall and the elevator floor as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had just sensed the
universe was not as sane as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been told. Ullman cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) throat and
raised the car a little, brought it to a stop with a jerk -LRB-still two inches
low-RRB-, and they all climbed out. With their weight gone the car rebounded almost
to floor level, something Wendy did not find reassuring at all. Safe as houses
or not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) resolved to take the stairs when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had to go up or down in this
place. And under no conditions would she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) allow the three of them to get into the
rickety thing together.
``What are you looking at, doc?'' Jack inquired humorously. ``See any spots
there?''
``Of course not,'' Ullman said, nettled. ``All the rugs were shampooed just two
days ago.''
Wendy glanced down at the hall runner herself. Pretty, but definitely not
anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would choose for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) own home, if the day ever came when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had
one. Deep blue pile, it was entwined with what seemed to be a surrealistic
jungle scene full of ropes and vines and trees filled with exotic birds. It was
hard to tell just what sort of birds, because all the interweaving was done in
unshaded black, giving only silhouettes.
``Do you like the rug?'' Wendy asked Danny.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mom,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said colorlessly.
They walked down the hall, which was comfortably wide. The wallpaper was silk,
a lighter blue to go against the rug. Electric flambeaux stood at ten-foot
intervals at a height of about seven feet. Fashioned to look like London gas
lamps, the bulbs were masked behind cloudy, cream-hued glass that was bound with

<p/>crisscrossing iron strips.
<div class="bookquote">``I like those very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said.
Ullman nodded, pleased. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Derwent had those installed throughout the Hotel
after the war -- number Two, I mean. In fact most -- although not all -- of the thirdfloor decorating scheme was his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) idea. This is 300, the Presidential Suite.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) twisted his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) key in the lock of the mahogany double doors and swung them
wide. The sitting room's wide western exposure made them all gasp, which had
probably been Ullman's intention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Quite a view, isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It sure is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said.
The window ran nearly the length of the sitting room, and beyond it the sun
was poised directly between two sawtoothed peaks, casting golden light across
the rock faces and the sugared snow on the high tips. The clouds around and
behind this picture-postcard view were also tinted gold, and a sunbeam glinted
duskily down into the darkly pooled firs below the timberline.
Jack and Wendy were so absorbed in the view that they didn't look down at
Danny, who was staring not out the window but at the red-and-white-striped silk
wallpaper to the left, where a door opened into an interior bedroom. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
gasp, which had been mingled with theirs, had nothing to do with beauty.
Great splashes of dried blood, flecked with tiny bits of grayish-white tissue,
clotted the wallpaper. It made Danny feel sick. It was like a crazy picture
drawn in blood, a surrealistic etching of a man's face drawn back in terror and
pain, the mouth yawning and half the head pulverized --
-LRB-So if you should see something ... just look the other way and when you
look back, it'll be gone. Are you diggin me?-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deliberately looked out the window, being careful to show no expression on
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, and when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mommy's hand closed over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took it, being
careful not to squeeze it or give her (<font color='blue'><b>mommy</b></font>) a signal of any kind.
The manager was saying something to his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) daddy about making sure to shutter
that big window so a strong wind wouldn't blow it in. Jack was nodding. Danny
looked cautiously back at the wall. The big dried bloodstain was gone. Those
little gray-white flecks that had been scattered all through it, they were gone,
too.
Then Ullman was leading them out. Mommy asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) thought the mountains
were pretty. Danny said he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) did, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't really care for the
mountains, one way or the other. As Ullman was closing the door behind them,
Danny looked back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shoulder. The bloodstain had returned, only now it
was fresh. It was running. Ullman, looking directly at it, went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)
running commentary about the famous men who had stayed here. Danny discovered
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had bitten his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lip hard enough to make it bleed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had never even
felt it. As they walked on down the corridor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fell a little bit behind the
others and wiped the blood away with the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand and thought about
-LRB-blood-RRB-
-LRB-Did Mr. Hallorann see blood or was it something worse?-RRB-
-LRB-I don't think those things can hurt you.-RRB-
There was an iron scream behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) lips, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) would not let it out. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>)
mommy and daddy could not see such things; they never had. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) would keep quiet.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) mommy and daddy were loving each other, and that was a real thing. The other
things were just like pictures in a book. Some pictures were scary, but they

<p/>couldn't hurt you. They ... couldn't ... hurt you.
Mr. Ullman showed them some other rooms on the third floor, leading them
through corridors that twisted and turned like a maze. They were all sweets up
here, Mr. Ullman said, although Danny didn't see any candy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) showed them some
rooms where a lady named Marilyn Monroe once stayed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Monroe</b></font>) was married to a
man named Arthur Miller -LRB-Danny got a vague understanding that Marilyn and Arthur
had gotten a DIVORCE not long after they were in the Overlook Hotel-RRB-.
<div class="bookquote">``Mommy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What, honey?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If they were married, why did they have different names? You and Daddy have
the same names.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but we're not famous, Danny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``Famous women keep their same
names even after they get married because their names are their bread and
butter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bread and butter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said, completely mystified.
<div class="bookquote">``What Daddy means is that people used to like to go to the movies and see
Marilyn Monroe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said, <div class="bookquote">``but they might not like to go to see Marilyn
Miller.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why not? She (<font color='blue'><b>Marilyn</b></font>)'d still be the same lady. Wouldn't everyone know that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but -- ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked at Jack helplessly.
<div class="bookquote">``Truman Capote once stayed in this room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman interrupted impatiently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)
opened the door. <div class="bookquote">``That was in my time. An awfully nice man. Continental
manners.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>There was nothing remarkable in any of these rooms -LRB-except for the absence of
sweets, which Mr. Ullman kept calling them-RRB-, nothing that Danny was afraid of.
In fact, there was only one other thing on the third floor that bothered Danny,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could not have said why. It was the fire extinguisher on the wall just
before they turned the corner and went back to the elevator, which stood open
and waiting like a mouthful of gold teeth.
It was an old-fashioned extinguisher, a flat hose folded back a dozen times
upon itself, one end attached to a large red valve, the other ending in a brass
nozzle. The folds of the hose were secured with a red steel slat on a hinge. In
case of a fire you could knock the steel slat up and out of the way with one
hard push and the hose was yours. Danny could see that much; he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was good at
seeing how things worked. By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was two and a half he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been
unlocking the protective gate his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father had installed at the top of the stairs
in the Stovington house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had seen how the lock worked. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy said it was
a NACK. Some people had the NACK and some people didn't.
This fire extinguisher was a little older than others he (<font color='blue'><b>NACK</b></font>) had seen -- the one in
the nursery school, for instance -- but that was not so unusual. Nonetheless it
filled him (<font color='blue'><b>NACK</b></font>) with faint unease, curled up there against the light blue wallpaper
like a sleeping snake. And he (<font color='blue'><b>NACK</b></font>) was glad when it was out of sight around the
corner.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course all the windows have to be shuttered,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Mr. Ullman said as they
stepped back into the elevator. Once again the car sank queasily beneath their
feet. <div class="bookquote">``But I'm particularly concerned about the one in the Presidential Suite.
The original bill on that window was four hundred and twenty dollars, and that
was over thirty years ago. It would cost eight times that to replace today.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll shutter it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said.
They went down to the second floor where there were more rooms and even more
twists and turns in the corridor. The light from the windows had begun to fade
appreciably now as the sun went behind the mountains. Mr. Ullman showed them one
or two rooms and that was all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) walked past 217, the one Dick Hallorann had
warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) about, without slowing. Danny looked at the bland number-plate on the
door with uneasy fascination.
Then down to the first floor. Mr. Ullman didn't show them into any rooms here
until they had almost reached the thickly carpeted staircase that led down into
the lobby again. <div class="bookquote">``Here are your quarters,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I think you'll find them
adequate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They went in. Danny was braced for whatever might be there. There was nothing.
Wendy Torrance felt a strong surge of relief. The Presidential Suite, with its
cold elegance, had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) feel awkward and clumsy -- it was all very well to
visit some restored historical building with a bedroom plaque that announced
Abraham Lincoln or Franklin D. Roosevelt had slept there, but another thing
entirely to imagine you and your husband lying beneath acreages of linen and
perhaps making love where the greatest men in the world had once lain -LRB-the most
powerful, anyway, she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) amended-RRB-. But this apartment was simpler, homier, almost
inviting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) could abide this place for a season with no great
difficulty.
<div class="bookquote">``It's very pleasant,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) said to Ullman, and heard the gratitude in her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>)
voice.
Ullman nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Simple but adequate. During the season, this suite quarters
the cook and his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) wife, or the cook and his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) apprentice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hallorann lived here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny broke in.
Mr. Ullman inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) head to Danny condescendingly. <div class="bookquote">``Quite so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) and Mr.
Nevers.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) turned back to Jack and Wendy. <div class="bookquote">``This is the sitting room.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Detective</b></font>)</div>There were several chairs that looked comfortable but not expensive, a coffee
table that had once been expensive but now had a long chip gone from the side,
two bookcases -LRB-stuffed full of Reader's Digest Condensed Books and Detective
Book Club trilogies from the forties, Wendy saw with some amusement-RRB-, and an
anonymous hotel TV that looked much less elegant than the buffed wood consoles
in the rooms.
<div class="bookquote">``No kitchen, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman said, <div class="bookquote">``but there is a dumb-waiter. This
apartment is directly over the kitchen.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) slid aside a square of paneling and
disclosed a wide, squarer tray. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) gave it a push and it disappeared, trailing
rope behind it.
<div class="bookquote">``It's a secret passage!''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said excitedly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother, momentarily
forgetting all fears in favor of that intoxicating shaft behind the wall. <div class="bookquote">``Just
like in Abbott and Costello Meet the Monsters!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Mr. Ullman frowned but Wendy smiled indulgently. Danny ran over to the dumbwaiter and peered down the shaft.,
<div class="bookquote">``This way, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) opened the door on the far side of the living room. It gave on the bedroom,
which was spacious and airy. There were twin beds. Wendy looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) husband,
smiled, shrugged.
<div class="bookquote">``No problem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``We'll push them together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Ullman looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) shoulder, honestly puzzled. <div class="bookquote">``Beg pardon?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The beds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said pleasantly. <div class="bookquote">``We can push them together.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman said, momentarily confused. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) face cleared and a
red flush began to creep up from the collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) shirt. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever you like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) led them back into the sitting room, where a second door opened on a second
bedroom, this one equipped with bunk beds. A radiator clanked in one corner, and
the rug on the floor was a hideous embroidery of western sage and cactus -- Danny
bad already fallen in love with it, Wendy saw. The walls of this smaller room
were paneled in real pine.
<div class="bookquote">``Think you can stand it in here, doc?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Sure I can. I'm going to sleep in the top bunk. Okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If that's what you want.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I like the rug, too. Mr. Ullman, why don't you have all the rugs like that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Mr. Ullman looked for a moment as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had sunk his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) teeth into a lemon. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) smiled and patted Danny's head. <div class="bookquote">``Those are your quarters,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``except
for the bath, which opens off the main bedroom. It's not a huge apartment, but
of course you'll have the rest of the hotel to spread out in. The lobby
fireplace is in good working order, or so Watson tells me, and you must feel
free to eat in the dining room if the spirit moves you to do so.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) spoke in
the tone of a man conferring a great favor.
<div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said.
<div class="bookquote">``Shall we go down?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Mr. Ullman asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said.
They went downstairs in the elevator, and now the lobby was wholly deserted
except for Watson, who was leaning against the main doors in a rawhide jacket, a
toothpick between his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) lips.
<div class="bookquote">``I would have thought you'd be miles from here by now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Mr. Ullman said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)
voice slightly chill.
<div class="bookquote">``Just stuck around to remind Mr. Torrance here about the boiler,''  (<font color='red'><b>Watson/Mr. Watson</b></font>)</div>Watson said,
straightening up. <div class="bookquote">``Keep your good weather eye on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), fella, and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll be fine.
Knock the press down a couple of times a day. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) creeps.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) creeps, Danny thought, and the words echoed down a long and silent
corridor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind, a corridor lined with mirrors where people seldom looked.
<div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>daddy</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy said.
<div class="bookquote">``You'll be fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Watson/Mr. Watson</b></font>)</div>Watson said, and offered Jack his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) hand. Jack shook it.
Watson turned to Wendy and inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm pleased,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said, and thought it would sound absurd. It didn't. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
had come out here from New England, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) life, and it seemed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) that in a few short sentences this man Watson, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) fluffy fringe of
hair, had epitomized what the West was supposed to be all about. And never mind
the lecherous wink earlier.
<div class="bookquote">``Young master Torrance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Watson/Mr. Watson</b></font>)</div>Watson said gravely, and put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) hand. Danny, who
had known all about handshaking for almost a year now, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) own hand out
gingerly and felt it swallowed up. <div class="bookquote">``You take good care of em, Dan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Watson/Mr. Watson</b></font>)</div>Watson let go of Danny's hand and straightened up fully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) looked at Ullman.
<div class="bookquote">``Until next year, I guess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) said, and held his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) hand out.
Ullman touched it bloodlessly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) pinky ring caught the lobby's electric

<p/>lights in a baleful sort of wink.
<div class="bookquote">``May twelfth, Watson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Not a day earlier or later.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Watson/Mr. Watson</b></font>)</div>Watson said, and Jack could almost read the codicil in Watson's
mind: ... you fucking little faggot.
<div class="bookquote">``Have a good winter, Mr. Ullman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I doubt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman said remotely.
Watson opened one of the two big main doors; the wind whined louder and began
to flutter the collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) jacket. <div class="bookquote">``You folks take care now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) said.
It was Danny who answered. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, we will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Watson/Mr. Watson</b></font>)</div>Watson, whose not-so-distant ancestor had owned this place, slipped humbly
through the door. It closed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>), muffling the wind. Together they watched
him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) clop down the porch's broad front steps in his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) battered black cowboy boots.
Brittle yellow aspen leaves tumbled around his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) heels as he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) crossed the lot to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) International Harvester pickup and climbed in. Blue smoke jetted from the
rusted exhaust pipe as he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) started it up. The spell of silence held among them as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) backed, then pulled out of the parking lot. His (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) truck disappeared over the
brow of the hill and then reappeared, smaller, on the main road, heading west.
For a moment Danny felt more lonely than he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ever had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) life.

<p/><< 13 >>
THE FRONT PORCH
The Torrance family stood together on the long front porch of the Overlook
Hotel as if posing for a family portrait, Danny in the middle, zippered into
last year's fall jacket which was now too small and starting to come out at the
elbow, Wendy behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) with one hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shoulder, and Jack to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) left, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
own hand resting lightly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) son's head.
Mr. Ullman was a step below them, buttoned into an expensive-looking brown
mohair overcoat. The sun was entirely behind the mountains now, edging them with
gold fire, making the shadows around things look long and purple. The only three
vehicles left in the parking lots were the hotel truck, Ullman's Lincoln
Continental, and the battered Torrance VW.
<div class="bookquote">``You've got your keys, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman said to Jack, <div class="bookquote">``and you understand fully
about the furnace and the boiler?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack nodded, feeling some real sympathy for Ullman. Everything was done for
the season, the ball of string was neatly wrapped up until next May 12 -- not a
day earlier or later -- and Ullman, who was responsible for all of it and who
referred to the hotel in the unmistakable tones of infatuation, could not help
looking for loose ends.
<div class="bookquote">``I think everything is well in hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said.
<div class="bookquote">``Good. I'll be in touch.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) still lingered for a moment, as if waiting

<p/>for the wind to take a hand and perhaps gust him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) car. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) sighed.
<div class="bookquote">``All right. Have a good winter, Mr. Torrance, Mrs. Torrance. You too, Danny.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you do, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I doubt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman repeated, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) sounded sad. <div class="bookquote">``The place in Florida is a
dump, if the out-and-out truth is to be spoken. Busywork. The Overlook is my
real job. Take good care of it for me, Mr. Torrance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think it will be here when you get back next spring,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said, and a
thought flashed through Danny's mind
-LRB-but will we?-RRB-
and was gone.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course. Of course it will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman looked out toward the playground where the hedge animals were
clattering in the wind. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) nodded once more in a businesslike way.
<div class="bookquote">``Good-by, then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) walked quickly and prissily across to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) car--a ridiculously big one for
such a little man and tucked himself into it. The Lincoln's motor purred into
life and the taillights flashed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) pulled out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) parking stall. As the
car moved away, Jack could read the small sign at the head of the stall:
RESERVED FOR MR. ULLMAN, MGR.
<div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said softly.
They watched until the car was out of sight, headed down the eastern slope.
When it was gone, the three of them looked at each other for a silent, almost
frightened moment. They were alone. Aspen leaves whirled and skittered in
aimless packs across the lawn that was now neatly mowed and tended for no
guest's eyes. There was no one to see the autumn leaves steal across the grass
but the three of them. It gave Jack a curious shrinking feeling, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) life
force had dwindled to a mere spark while the hotel and the grounds had suddenly
doubled in size and become sinister, dwarfing them with sullen, inanimate power.
Then Wendy said: <div class="bookquote">``Look at you, doc. Your nose is running like a fire hose.
Let's get inside.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>And they did, closing the door firmly behind them against the restless whine
of the wind.

The Wasps' Nest
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

<p/><< 14 >>
UP ON THE ROOF
<div class="bookquote">``Oh you goddam fucking son of a bitch!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The Wasps</b></font>)</div>Jack Torrance cried these words out in both surprise and agony as he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) slapped
his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) right hand against his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) blue chambray workshirt, dislodging the big, slowmoving wasp that had stung him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) was scrambling up the roof as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>)
could, looking back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) shoulder to see if the wasp's brothers and sisters
were rising from the nest he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had uncovered to do battle. If they were, it could
be bad; the nest was between him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) ladder, and the trapdoor leading down
into the attic was locked from the inside. The drop was seventy feet from the
roof to the cement patio between the hotel and the lawn.
The clear air above the nest was still and undisturbed.
Jack whistled disgustedly between his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) teeth, sat straddling the peak of the
roof, and examined his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) right index finger. It was swelling already, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would have to try and creep past that nest to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ladder so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could
go down and put some ice on it.
It was October 20. Wendy and Danny had gone down to Sidewinder in the hotel
truck -LRB-an elderly, rattling Dodge that was still more trustworthy than the VW,
which was now wheezing gravely and seemed terminal-RRB- to get three gallons of milk
and do some Christmas shopping. It was early to shop, but there was no telling
when the snow would come to stay. There had already been flurries, and in some
places the road down from the Overlook was slick with patch ice.
So far the fall had been almost preternaturally beautiful. In the three weeks
they had been here, golden day had followed golden day. Crisp, thirty-degree
mornings gave way to afternoon temperatures in the low sixties, the perfect
temperature for climbing around on the Overlook's gently sloping western roof
and doing the shingling. Jack had admitted freely to Wendy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could have
finished the job four days ago, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) felt no real urge to hurry. The view from
up here was spectacular, even putting the vista from the Presidential Suite in
the shade. More important, the work itself was soothing. On the roof he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) felt
himself healing from the troubled wounds of the last three years. On the roof he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
felt at peace. Those three years began to seem like a turbulent nightmare.
The shingles had been badly rotted, some of them blown entirely away by last
winter's storms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had ripped them all up, yelling <div class="bookquote">``Bombs away!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) dropped
them over the side, not wanting Danny to get hit in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had wandered over.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been pulling out bad flashing when the wasp had gotten him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).
The ironic part was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) warned himself each time he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) climbed onto the roof
to keep an eye out for nests; he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had gotten that bug bomb just in case. But this
morning the stillness and peace had been so complete that his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) watchfulness had

<p/>lapsed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been back in the world of the play he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was slowly creating,
roughing out whatever scene he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would be working on that evening in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head. The
play was going very well, and although Wendy had said little, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was
pleased. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been roadblocked on the crucial scene between Denker, the
sadistic headmaster, and Gary Benson, his (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) young hero, during the last unhappy
six months at Stovington, months when the craving for a drink had been so bad
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) could barely concentrate on his (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) in-class lectures, let alone his (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>)
extracurricular literary ambitions.
But in the last twelve evenings, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) actually sat down in front of the
office-model Underwood he (<font color='blue'><b>Underwood</b></font>) had borrowed from the main office downstairs, the
roadblock had disappeared under his (<font color='blue'><b>Underwood</b></font>) fingers as magically as cotton candy
dissolves on the lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>Underwood</b></font>) had come up almost effortlessly with the insights into
Denker's character that had always been lacking, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denker</b></font>) had rewritten most of
the second act accordingly, making it revolve around the new scene. And the
progress of the third act, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Denker</b></font>) had been turning over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Denker</b></font>) mind when the
wasp put an end to cogitation, was coming clearer all the time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denker</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Denker</b></font>)
could rough it out in two weeks, and have a clean copy of the whole damned play
by New Year's.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Denker</b></font>) had an agent in New York, a tough red-headed woman named Phyllis Sandler
who smoked Herbert Tareytons, drank Jim Beam from a paper cup, and thought the
literary sun rose and set on Sean O'Casey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) had marketed three of Jack's
short stories, including the Esquire piece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had written her (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) about the play,
which was called The Little School, describing the basic conflict between
Denker, a gifted student who had failed into becoming the brutal and brutalizing
headmaster of a turn-of-the-century New England prep school, and Gary Benson,
the student he (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) sees as a younger version of himself. Phyllis had written back
expressing interest and admonishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) to read O'Casey before sitting down to
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) had written again earlier that year asking where the hell was the play?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) had written back wryly that The Little School had been indefinitely -- and
perhaps infinitely -- delayed between hand and page <div class="bookquote">``in that interesting
intellectual Gobi known as the writer's block.''  (<font color='red'><b>Little School</b></font>)</div>Now it looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Phyllis</b></font>) might
actually get the play. Whether or not it was any good or if it would ever see
actual production was another matter. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) didn't seem to care a great deal
about those things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) felt in a way that the play itself, the whole thing, was
the roadblock, a colossal symbol of the bad years at Stovington Prep, the
marriage he (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) had almost totaled like a nutty kid behind the wheel of an old
jalopy, the monstrous assault on his (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) son, the incident in the parking lot with
George Hatfield, an incident he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) could no longer view as just another sudden and
destructive flare of temper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) now thought that part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) drinking problem
had stemmed from an unconscious desire to be free of Stovington and the security
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) felt was stifling whatever creative urge he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) had. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) had stopped drinking, but
the need to be free had been just as great. Hence George Hatfield. Now all that
remained of those days was the play on the desk in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) and Wendy's bedroom, and
when it was done and sent off to Phyllis's hole-in-the-wall New York agency, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>)
could turn to other things. Not a novel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) was not ready to stumble into the
swamp of another three-year undertaking, but surely more short stories. Perhaps
a book of them.
Moving warily, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) scrambled back down the slope of the roof on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) hands and

<p/>knees past the line of demarcation where the fresh green Bird shingles gave way
to the section of roof he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) had just finished clearing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) came to the edge on the
left of the wasps' nest he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) had uncovered and moved gingerly toward it, ready to
backtrack and bolt down his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) ladder to the ground if things looked too hot.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) leaned over the section of pulled-out flashing and looked in.
The nest was in there, tucked into the space between the old flashing and the
final roof undercoating of three-by-fives. It was a damn big one. The grayish
paper ball looked to Jack as if it might be nearly two feet through the center.
Its shape was not perfect because the space between the flashing and the boards
was too narrow, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) thought the little buggers had still done a pretty
respectable job. The surface of the nest was acrawl with the lumbering, slowmoving insects. They were the big mean ones, not yellow jackets, which are
smaller and calmer, but wall wasps. They had been rendered sludgy and stupid by
the fall temperatures, but Jack, who knew about wasps from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) childhood,
counted himself lucky that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been stung only once. And, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) thought, if
Ullman had hired the job done in the height of summer, the workman who tore up
that particular section of the flashing would have gotten one hell of a
surprise. Yes indeedy. When a dozen wall wasps land on you all at once and start
stinging your face and hands and arms, stinging your legs right through your
pants, it would be entirely possible to forget you were seventy feet up. You
might just charge right off the edge of the roof while you were trying to get
away from them. All from those little things, the biggest of them only half the
length of a pencil stub.
He (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) had read someplace -- in a Sunday supplement piece or a back-of-the-book
newsmagazine article -- that 7 per cent of all automobile fatalities go
unexplained. No mechanical failure, no excessive speed, no booze, no bad
weather. Simply one-car crashes on deserted sections of road, one dead occupant,
the driver, unable to explain what had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>). The article had included
an interview with a state trooper who theorized that many of these so-called
<div class="bookquote">``foo crashes''  (<font color='red'><b>a state trooper</b></font>)</div>resulted from insects in the car. Wasps, a bee, possibly even a
spider or moth. The driver gets panicky, tries to swat it or unroll a window to
let it out. Possibly the insect stings him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>). Maybe the driver just loses control.
Either way it's bang! ... all over. And the insect, usually completely
unharmed, would buzz merrily out of the smoking wreck, looking for greener
pastures. The trooper had been in favor of having pathologists look for insect
venom while autopsying such victims, Jack recalled.
Now, looking down into the nest, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) that it could serve as both
a workable symbol for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been through -LRB-and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had dragged his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
hostages to fortune through-RRB- and an omen for a better future. How else could you
explain the things that had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)? For he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) still felt that the whole
range of unhappy Stovington experiences had to be looked at with Jack Torrance
in the passive mode. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had not done things; things had been done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had
known plenty of people on the Stovington faculty, two of them right in the
English Department, who were hard drinkers. Zack Tunney was in the habit of
picking up a full keg of beer on Saturday afternoon, plonking it in a backyard
snowbank overnight, and then killing damn near all of it on Sunday watching
football games and old movies. Yet through the week Zack was as sober as a
judge -- a weak cocktail with lunch was an occasion.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zack</b></font>) and Al Shockley had been alcoholics. They had sought each other out like
two castoffs who were still social enough to prefer drowning together to doing
it alone. The sea had been whole-grain instead of salt, that was all. Looking
down at the wasps, as they slowly went about their instinctual business before
winter closed down to kill all but their hibernating queen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Zack</b></font>) would go further.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Zack</b></font>) was still an alcoholic, always would be, perhaps had been since Sophomore
Class Night in high school when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sophomore</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Sophomore</b></font>) first drink. It had nothing to
do with willpower, or the morality of drinking, or the weakness or strength of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sophomore</b></font>) own character. There was a broken switch somewhere inside, or a circuit
breaker that didn't work, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sophomore</b></font>) had been propelled down the chute willynilly,
slowly at first, then accelerating as Stovington applied its pressures on him (<font color='blue'><b>Sophomore</b></font>). A
big grease& slide and at the bottom had been a shattered, ownerless bicycle and
a son with a broken arm. Jack Torrance in the passive mode. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) temper, same
thing. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had been trying unsuccessfully to control it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) could
remember himself at seven, spanked by a neighbor lady for playing with matches.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had gone out and hurled a rock at a passing car. His (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) father had seen that,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had descended on little Jacky, roaring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had reddened Jack's behind ... and then blacked his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
eye. And when his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) father had gone into the house,
muttering, to see what was on television, Jack had come upon a stray dog and had
kicked it into the gutter. There had been two dozen fights in grammar school,
even more of them in high school, warranting two suspensions and uncounted
detentions in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) good grades. Football had provided a partial safety
valve, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) remembered perfectly well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had spent almost every
minute of every game in a state of high piss-off, taking every opposing block
and tackle personally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been a fine player, making All-Conference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
junior and senior years, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knew perfectly well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own bad
temper to thank ... or to blame. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had not enjoyed football. Every game was a
grudge match.
And yet, through it all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hadn't felt like a son of a bitch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hadn't felt
mean. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had always regarded himself as Jack Torrance, a really nice guy who was
just going to have to learn how to cope with his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) temper someday before it got
him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) in trouble. The same way he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) was going to have to learn how to cope with his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>)
drinking. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had been an emotional alcoholic just as surely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had been a
physical one the two of them were no doubt tied together somewhere deep inside
him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>), where you'd just as soon not look. But it didn't much matter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) if the
root causes were interrelated or separate, sociological or psychological or
physiological. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had had to deal with the results: the spankings, the beatings
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) old man, the suspensions, with trying to explain the school clothes
torn in playground brawls, and later the hangovers, the slowly dissolving glue
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) marriage, the single bicycle wheel with its bent spokes pointing into the
sky, Danny's broken arm. And George Hatfield, of course.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) had unwittingly stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) hand into The Great Wasps' Nest of
Life. As an image it stank. As a cameo of reality, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) felt it was serviceable.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) had stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) hand through some rotted flashing in high summer and that hand
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) whole arm had been consumed in holy, righteous fire, destroying
conscious thought, making the concept of civilized behavior obsolete. Could you
be expected to behave as a thinking human being when your hand was being impaled
on red-hot darning needles? Could you be expected to live in the love of your

<p/>nearest and dearest when the brown, furious cloud rose out of the hole in the
fabric of things -LRB-the fabric you thought was so innocent-RRB- and arrowed straight
at you? Could you be held responsible for your own actions as you ran crazily
about on the sloping roof seventy feet above the ground, not knowing where you
were going, not remembering that your panicky, stumbling feet could lead you
crashing and blundering right over the rain gutter and down to your death on the
concrete seventy feet below? Jack didn't think you could. When you unwittingly
stuck your hand into the wasps' nest, you hadn't made a covenant with the devil
to give up your civilized self with its trappings of love and respect and honor.
It just happened to you. Passively, with no say, you ceased to be a creature of
the mind and became a creature of the nerve endings; from college-educated man
to wailing ape in five easy seconds.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought about George Hatfield.
Tall and shaggily blond, George had been an almost insolently beautiful boy.
In his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) tight faded jeans and Stovington sweatshirt with the sleeves carelessly
pushed up to the elbows to disclose his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) tanned forearms, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had reminded Jack of
a young Robert Redford, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Redford</b></font>) doubted that George had much trouble scoring -- no
more than that young footballplaying devil Jack Torrance had ten years earlier.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) could say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) honestly didn't feel jealous of George, or envy him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
good looks; in fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had almost unconsciously begun to visualize George as
the physical incarnation of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) play hero, Gary Benson -- the perfect foil for the
dark, slumped, and aging Denker, who grew to hate Gary so much. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gary</b></font>), Jack
Torrance, had never felt that way about George. If he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would have known
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was quite sure of that.
George had floated through his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) classes at Stovington. A soccer and baseball
star, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) academic program had been fairly undemanding and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had been content
with C's and an occasional B in history or botany. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was a fierce field
contender but a lackadaisical, amused sort of student in the classrooms. Jack was
familiar with the type, more from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own days as a high school and college
student than from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) teaching experience, which was at second hand. George
Hatfield was a jock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) could be a calm, undemanding figure in the classroom,
but when the right set of competitive stimuli was applied -LRB-like electrodes to
the temples of Frankenstein's monster, Jack thought wryly-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could become a
juggernaut.
In January, George had tried out with two dozen others for the debate team. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
had been quite frank with Jack. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) father was a corporation lawyer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) son to follow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) footsteps. George, who felt no burning call to
do anything else, was willing. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grades were not top end, but this was, after
all, only prep school and it was still early times. If should be came to must
be, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father could pull some strings. George's own athletic ability would open
still other doors. But Brian Hatfield thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) son should get on the debate
team. It was good practice, and it was something that law-school admissions
boards always looked for. So George went out for debate, and in late March Jack
cut him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) from the team.
The late winter inter-squad debates had fired George Hatfield's competitive
soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) became a grimly determined debater, prepping his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) pro or con position
fiercely. It didn't matter if the subject was legalization of marijuana,
reinstating the death penalty, or the oil-depletion allowance. George became

<p/>conversant, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was just jingoist enough to honestly not care which side he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
was on--a rare and valuable trait, even in high-level debaters, Jack knew. The
souls of a true carpetbagger and a true debater were not far removed from each
other; they were both passionately interested in the main chance. So far, so
good.
But George Hatfield stuttered.
This was not a handicap that had even shown up in the classroom, where George
was always cool and collected -LRB-whether he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had done his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) homework or not-RRB-, and
certainly not on the Stovington playing fields, where talk was not a virtue and
they sometimes even threw you out of the game for too much discussion.
When George got tightly wound up in a debate, the stutter would come out. The
more eager he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) became, the worse it was. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had an opponent dead
in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sights, an intellectual sort of buck fever seemed to take place between
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) speech centers and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mouth and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would freeze solid while the clock ran
out. It was painful to watch.
<div class="bookquote">``S-S-So I th-th-think we have to say that the fuh-fuh-facts in the c-case Mr.
D-D-D-Dorsky cites are ren-ren-rendered obsolete by the ruh-recent duh-duhdecision handed down inin-in ... ''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Hatfield/Hatfield</b></font>)</div>The buzzer would go off and George would whirl around to stare furiously at
Jack, who sat beside it. George's face at those moments would be flushed, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
notes crumpled spasmodically in one hand.
Jack had held on to George long after he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had cut most of the obvious flat
tires, hoping George would work out. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) remembered one late afternoon about a
week before he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had reluctantly dropped the ax. George had stayed after the
others had filed out, and then had confronted Jack angrily.
<div class="bookquote">``You s-set the timer ahead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack looked up from the papers he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was putting back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) briefcase.
<div class="bookquote">``George, what are you talking about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I d-didn't get my whole five mih-minutes. You set it ahead. I was wuhwatching the clock.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The clock and the timer may keep slightly different times, George, but I
never touched the dial on the damned thing. Scout's honor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yuh-yuh-you did!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The belligerent, I'm-sticking-up-for-my-rights way George was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
had sparked Jack's own temper. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had been off the sauce for two months, two months too long,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was ragged. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) made one last effort to hold himself in. <div class="bookquote">``I assure you I did not, George. It's
your stutter. Do you have any idea what causes it? You don't stutter in class.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I duh-duh-don't s-s-st-st-stutterl''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``F-fuh-fuck th-that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``George, if you control your stutter, I'd be glad to have you. You're well
prepped for every practice and you're good at the background stuff, which means
you're rarely surprised. But all that doesn't mean much if you can't control
that--''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've neh-neh-never stuttered!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cried out. <div class="bookquote">``It's yuh-you! I-i-if suhsomeone else had the d-d-deb-debate t-team, I could -- ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div><p/>Jack's temper slipped another notch.
<div class="bookquote">``George, you're never going to make much of a lawyer, corporation or
otherwise, if you can't control that. Law isn't like soccer. Two hours of
practice every night won't cut it. What are you going to do, stand up in front
of a board meeting and say, `Nuh-nuh-now, g-gentlemen, about this t-ttort'?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) suddenly flushed, not with anger but with shame at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own cruelty. This
was not a man in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) but a seventeen-year-old boy who was facing the
first major defeat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) life, and maybe asking in the only way he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could for
Jack to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) find a way to cope with it.
George gave him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) a final, furious glance, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lips twisting and bucking as the
words bottled up behind them struggled to find their way out.
<div class="bookquote">``Yuh-yuh-you s-s-set it ahead! You huh-hate me b-because you nuh-nuh-nuh-know
... you know ... nuh-nuh -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With an articulate cry he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had rushed out of the classroom, slamming the door
hard enough to make the wire-reinforced glass rattle in its frame. Jack had
stood there, feeling, rather than hearing, the echo of George's Adidas in the
empty hall. Still in the grip of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) temper and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shame at mocking George's
stutter, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) first thought had been a sick sort of exultation: For the first
time in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) life George Hatfield had wanted something he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could not have. For the
first time there was something wrong that all of Daddy's money could not fix.
You couldn't bribe a speech center. You couldn't offer a tongue an extra fifty a
week and a bonus at Christmas if it would agree to stop flapping like a record
needle in a defective groove. Then the exultation was simply buried in shame,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) felt the way he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had after he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had broken Danny's arm.
Dear God, I am not a son of a bitch. Please.
That sick happiness at George's retreat was more typical of Denker in the play
than of Jack Torrance the playwright.
You hate me because you know ...
Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) knew what?
What could he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) possibly know about George Hatfield that would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) hate
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>)? That his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) whole future lay ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>)? That he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) looked a little bit like
Robert Redford and all conversation among the girls stopped when he (<font color='blue'><b>Redford</b></font>) did a double
gainer from the pool diving board? That he (<font color='blue'><b>Redford</b></font>) played soccer and baseball with a
natural, unlearned grace?
Ridiculous. Absolutely absurd. He (<font color='blue'><b>Redford</b></font>) envied George Hatfield nothing. If the truth
was known, he (<font color='blue'><b>Redford</b></font>) felt worse about George's unfortunate stutter than George himself,
because George really would have made an excellent debater. And if Jack had set
the timer ahead -- and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hadn't -- it would have been because both he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and
the other members of the squad were embarrassed for George's struggle, they had
agonized over it the way you agonize when the Class Night speaker forgets some
of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) lines. If he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had set the timer ahead, it would have been just to ... to
put George out of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) misery.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hadn't set the timer ahead. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was quite sure of it.
A week later he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had cut him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and that time he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) temper. The shouts
and the threats had all been on George's side. A week after that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had gone out
to the parking lot halfway through practice to get a pile of sourcebooks that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
had left in the trunk of the VW and there had been George, down on one knee with
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) long blond hair swinging in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face, a hunting knife in one hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was

<p/>sawing through the VW's right front tire. The back tires were already shredded,
and the bug sat on the flats like a small, tired dog.
Jack had seen red, and remembered very little of the encounter that followed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) remembered a thick growl that seemed to issue from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own throat: <div class="bookquote">``All
right, George. If that's how you want it, just come here and take your
medicine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) remembered George looking up, startled and fearful. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had said: <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Torrance -- ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as if to explain how all this was just a mistake, the tires had been
flat when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) got there and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was just cleaning dirt out of the front treads
with the tip of this gutting knife he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) just happened to have with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and --
Jack had waded in, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fists held up in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), and it seemed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
had been grinning. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wasn't sure of that.
The last thing be remembered was George holding up the knife and saying: <div class="bookquote">``You
better not come any closer -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Hatfield/Hatfield</b></font>)</div>And the next thing was Miss Strong, the French teacher, holding Jack's arms,
crying, screaming: <div class="bookquote">``Stop it, Jack! Stop it! You're going to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had blinked around stupidly. There was the hunting knife, glittering
harmlessly on the parking lot asphalt four yards away. There was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) Volkswagen,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) poor old battered bug, veteran of many wild midnight drunken rides, sitting
on three flat shoes. There was a new dent in the right front fender, he (<font color='blue'><b>dent</b></font>) saw, and
there was something in the middle of the dent that was either red paint or
blood. For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>dent</b></font>) had been confused, his (<font color='blue'><b>dent</b></font>) thoughts
-LRB-jesus christ al we hit him (<font color='blue'><b>dent</b></font>) after all-RRB-
of that other night. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>dent</b></font>) eyes had shifted to George, George lying dazed
and blinking on the asphalt. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) debate group had come out and they were huddled
together by the door, staring at George. There was blood on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face from a
scalp laceration that looked minor, but there was also blood running out of one
of George's ears and that probably meant a concussion. When George tried to get
up, Jack shook free of Miss Strong and went to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). George cringed.
Jack put his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands on George's chest and pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) back down. <div class="bookquote">``Lie still,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``Don't try to move.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) turned to Miss Strong, who was staring at them
both with horror.
<div class="bookquote">``Please go call the school doctor, Miss Strong,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>be told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) turned and
fled toward the office. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) debate class then, looked them right in
the eye because he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was in charge again, fully himself, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was himself
there wasn't a nicer guy in the whole state of Vermont. Surely they knew that.
<div class="bookquote">``You can go home now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) told them quietly. <div class="bookquote">``We'll meet again tomorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>debaters</b></font>)</div>But by the end of that week six of his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) debaters had dropped out, two of them
the class of the act, but of course it didn't matter much because he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) had been
informed by then that he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) would be dropping out himself.
Yet somehow he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) had stayed off the bottle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) supposed that was something.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) had not hated George Hatfield. He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) was sure of that. He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) had not acted
but had been acted upon.
You hate me because you know ...
But he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) had known nothing. Nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) would swear that before the Throne of
Almighty God, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would swear that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had set the timer ahead no more
than a minute. And not out of hate but out of pity.
Two wasps were crawling sluggishly about on the roof beside the hole in the

<p/>flashing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) watched them until they spread their aerodynamically unsound but strangely
efficient wings and lumbered off into the October sunshine, perchance to sting
someone else. God had seen fit to give them stingers and Jack supposed they had
to use them on somebody.
How long had he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) been sitting there, looking at that hole with its unpleasant
surprise down inside, raking over old coals? He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) watch. Almost half
an hour.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) let himself down to the edge of the roof, dropped one leg over, and felt
around until his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) foot found the top rung of the ladder just below the overhang.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would go down to the equipment shed where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had stored the bug bomb on a
high shelf out of Danny's reach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would get it, come back up, and then they
would be the ones surprised. You could be stung, but you could also sting back.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) believed that sincerely. Two hours from now the nest would be just so much
chewed paper and Danny could have it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) room if he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wanted to -- Jack had had
one in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) room when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was just a kid, it had always smelled faintly of
woodsmoke and gasoline. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could have it right by the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) bed. It
wouldn't hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I'm getting better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own voice, confident in the silent afternoon, reassured him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hadn't meant to speak aloud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was getting better. It was
possible to graduate from passive to active, to take the thing that had once
driven you nearly to madness as a neutral prize of no more than occasional
academic interest. And if there was a place where the thing could be done, this
was surely it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went down the ladder to get the bug bomb. They would pay. They would pay
for stinging him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).

DOWN IN THE FRONT YARD
Jack had found a huge white-painted wicker chair in the back of the equipment
shed two weeks ago, and had dragged it around to the porch over Wendy's
objections that it was really the ugliest thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had ever seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) whole
life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was sitting in it now, amusing himself with a copy of E. L. Doctorow's
Welcome to Hard Times, when his (<font color='blue'><b>L.</b></font>) wife and son rattled up the driveway in the
hotel truck.
Wendy parked it in the turn-around, raced the engine sportily, and then turned
it off. The truck's single taillight died. The engine rumbled grumpily with
post-ignition and finally stopped. Jack got out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) chair and ambled down to
meet them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi, Dad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny called, and raced up the hill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had a box in one hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Look what Mommy bought me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack picked his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) son up, swung him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) around twice, and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heartily on the
mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack Torrance, the Eugene O'Neill of his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Neill</b></font>) generation, the American
Shakespeare!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Fancy meeting you here, so far up in the
mountains.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The common ruck became too much for me, dear lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, and slipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
arms around her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). They kissed. <div class="bookquote">``How was your trip?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very good. Danny complains that I keep jerking him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) but I didn't stall the
truck once and ... oh, Jack, you finished it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was looking at the roof, and Danny followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) gaze. A faint frown
touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked at the wide swatch of fresh shingles atop the
Overlook's west wing, a lighter green than the rest of the roof. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked
down at the box in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face cleared again. At night the pictures
Tony had showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) came back to haunt in all their original clarity, but in
sunny daylight they were easier to disregard.
<div class="bookquote">``Look, Daddy, look!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack took the box from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) son. It was a model car, one of the Big Daddy Roth
caricatures that Danny bad expressed an admiration for in the past. This one was
the Violent Violet Volkswagen, and the picture on the box showed a huge purple
VW with long '59 Cadillac Coupe de Ville taillights burning up a dirt track.
The VW had a sunroof, and poking up through it, clawed hands on the wheel down
below, was a gigantic warty monster with popping bloodshot eyes, a maniacal
grin, and a gigantic English racing cap turned around backward.
Wendy was smiling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), and Jack winked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``That's what I like about you, doc,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said, handing the box back. <div class="bookquote">``Your
taste runs to the quiet, the sober, the introspective. You are definitely the
child of my loins.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mommy said you'd help me put it together as soon as I could read all of the
first Dick and Jane.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That ought to be by the end of the week,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``What else have you got

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Uh-uh.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) grabbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) arm and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) back. <div class="bookquote">``No peeking. Some of that
stuff is for you. Danny and I will take it in. You can get the milk. It's on the
floor of the cab.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's all I am to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack cried, clapping a hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) forehead. <div class="bookquote">``Just a
dray horse, a common beast of the field. Dray here, dray there, dray

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just dray that milk right into the kitchen, mister.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's too much!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) cried, and threw himself on the ground while Danny stood
over him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and giggled.
<div class="bookquote">``Get up, you ox,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said, and prodded him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) with the toe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sneaker.
<div class="bookquote">``See?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said to Danny. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) called me an ox. You're a witness.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Witness, witness!''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny concurred gleefully, and broadjumped his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) prone
father.
Jack sat up. <div class="bookquote">``That reminds me, chumly. I've got something for you. too. On the
porch by my ashtray.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Forgot. Go and see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack got up and the two of them stood together, watching Danny charge up the
lawn and then take the steps to the porch two by two. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) put an arm around
Wendy's waist.
<div class="bookquote">``You happy, babe?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) solemnly. <div class="bookquote">``This is the happiest I've been since we were
married.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that the truth?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``God's honest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) squeezed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) tightly. <div class="bookquote">``I love you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) squeezed him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) back, touched. Those had never been cheap words with John
Torrance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could count the number of times he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had said them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), both
before and after marriage, on both her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hands.
<div class="bookquote">``I love you too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mommy! Mommy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny was on the porch now, shrill and excited. <div class="bookquote">``Come and see! Wow! It's
neat!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) as they walked up from the parking lot, hand in
hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Forgot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, you'll get yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, and elbowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``See if you don't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was hoping I'd get it tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) remarked, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) laughed. A moment
later he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``Is Danny happy, do you think?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You ought to know. You're the one who has a long talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) every night
before bed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's usually about what he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wants to be when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) grows up or if Santa Claus
is really real. That's getting to be a big thing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Claus</b></font>). I think his (<font color='blue'><b>Claus</b></font>) old buddy
Scott let some pennies drop on that one. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) hasn't said much of anything
about the Overlook to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Me either,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. They were climbing the porch steps now. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>)'s very
quiet a lot of the time. And I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>)'s lost weight, Jack, I really do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s just getting tall.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny's back was to them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was examining something on the table by Jack's
chair, but Wendy couldn't see what it was.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s not eating as well, either. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) used to be the original steam shovel.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They taper off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said vaguely. <div class="bookquote">``I think I read that in Spock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Spock</b></font>)'ll be
using two forks again by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Spock</b></font>)'s seven.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They had stopped on the top step.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Spock</b></font>)'s pushing awfully hard on those readers, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Spock</b></font>) wants

<div class="bookquote">``To please himself most of all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't been pushing him (<font color='blue'><b>Spock</b></font>) on

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Would you think I was foolish if I made an appointment for him (<font color='blue'><b>Spock</b></font>) to have a

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose. If you think it's foolish -- ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't. In fact, you can make appointments for all three of us. We'll get

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll make the appointments this afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Mom! Look, Mommy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) came running to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) with a large gray thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands, and for one
comic-horrible moment Wendy thought it was a brain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw what it really was
and recoiled instinctively.
Jack put an arm around her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It's all right. The tenants who didn't fly away
have been shaken out. I used the bug bomb.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked at the large wasps' nest her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) son was holding but would not touch
it. <div class="bookquote">``Are you sure it's safe?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Positive. I had one in my room when I was a kid. My dad gave it to me. Want

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah! Right now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) turned around and raced through the double doors. They could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
muffled, running feet on the main stairs.
<div class="bookquote">``There were wasps up there,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Did you get stung?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where's my purple heart?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) asked, and displayed his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) finger. The swelling
had already begun to go down, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ooohed over it satisfyingly and gave it a
small, gentle kiss.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you pull the stinger out?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wasps don't leave them in. That's bees. They have barbed stingers. Wasp

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I followed the directions on the bomb. The stuff is guaranteed to kill every

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hate them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``What... wasps?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anything that stings,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hands went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) elbows and cupped
them, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arms crossed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breasts.
<div class="bookquote">``I do too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, and hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).

DANNY
Down the hall, in the bedroom, Wendy could hear the typewriter Jack had
carried up from downstairs burst into life for thirty seconds, fall silent for a
minute or two, and then rattle briefly again. It was like listening to machinegun fire from an isolated pillbox. The sound was music to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ears; Jack had not
been writing so steadily since the second year of their marriage, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wrote

<p/>the story that Esquire had purchased. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) thought the play would be done
by the end of the year, for better or worse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would be moving on to
something new. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) didn't care if The Little School stirred any
excitement when Phyllis showed it around, didn't care if it sank without a
trace, and Wendy believed that, too. The actual act of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) writing made her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
immensely hopeful, not because she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) expected great things from the play but
because her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) husband seemed to be slowly closing a huge door on a roomful of
monsters. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shoulder to that door for a long time now, but at last
it was swinging shut.
Every key typed closed it a little more.
<div class="bookquote">``Look, Dick, look.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny was hunched over the first of the five battered primers Jack had dug up
by culling mercilessly through Boulder's myriad secondhand bookshops. They would
take Danny right up to the second-grade reading level, a program she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had told
Jack she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought was much too ambitious. Their son was intelligent, they knew
that, but it would be a mistake to push him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) too far too fast. Jack had agreed.
There would be no pushing involved. But if the kid caught on fast, they would be
prepared. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wondered if Jack hadn't been right about that, too.
Danny, prepared by four years of <div class="bookquote">``Sesame Street''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>and three years of <div class="bookquote">``Electric
Company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>seemed to be catching on with almost scary speed. It bothered her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
hunched over the innocuous little books, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) crystal radio and balsa glider on
the shelf above him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) life depended on learning to read. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) small
face was more tense and paler than she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) liked in the close and cozy glow of the
goosenecked lamp they had put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was taking it very seriously, both
the reading and the workbook pages his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father made up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) every afternoon.
Picture of an apple and a peach. The word apple written beneath in Jack's large,
neatly made printing. Circle the right picture, the one that went with the word.
And their son would stare from the word to the pictures, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) lips moving,
sounding out, actually sweating it out, And with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) double-sized red pencil
curled into his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) pudgy right fist, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could now write about three dozen words on
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own.
His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) finger traced slowly under the words in the reader. Above them was a
picture Wendy half-remembered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) own grammar school days, nineteen years
before. A laughing boy with brown curly hair. A girl in a short dress, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair
in blond ringlets one hand holding a jump rope. A prancing dog running after a
large red rubber ball. The first-grade trinity. Dick, Jane, and Jip.
<div class="bookquote">``See Jip run,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny read slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Run, Jip, run. Run, run, run.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) paused,
dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) finger down a line. <div class="bookquote">``See the ...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bent closer, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) nose almost
touching the page now. <div class="bookquote">``See the ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not so close, doc,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said quietly. <div class="bookquote">``You'll hurt your eyes. It's-''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said, sitting up with a jerk. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) voice was alarmed.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me, Mommy, I can get it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right, honey,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But it's not a big thing. Really it's not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Unheeding, Danny bent forward again. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face was an expression that might
be more commonly seen hovering over a graduate record exam in a college gym
somewhere. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) liked it less and less.
<div class="bookquote">``See the ... buh. Aw. El. El. See the buhaw-el-el? See the buhawl. Ball!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Suddenly triumphant. Fierce. The fierceness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) voice scared her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). ``See the

<p/>ball!''
``That's right,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. ``Honey, I think that's enough for tonight.''
``A couple more pages, Mommy? Please?''
``No, doc.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) closed the red-bound book firmly. ``It's bedtime.''
``Please?''
``Don't tease me about it, Danny. Mommy's tired.''
``Okay.'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked longingly at the primer.
``Go kiss your father and then wash up. Don't forget to brush.''
``Yeah.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) slouched out, a small boy in pajama bottoms with feet and a large flannel
top with a football on the front and NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS written on the back.
Jack's typewriter stopped, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) heard Danny's hearty smack. ``Night, Daddy.''
``Goodnight, doc. How'd you do?''
``Okay, I guess. Mommy made me stop.''
``Mommy was right. It's past eight-thirty. Going to the bathroom?''
``Yeah.''
<div class="bookquote">``Good. There's potatoes growing out of your ears. And onions and carrots and
chives and -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Danny's giggle, fading, then cut off by the firm click of the bathroom door.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was private about his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bathroom functions, while both she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and Jack were pretty
much catch-as-catch-can. Another sign -- and they were multiplying all the time --
that there was another human being in the place, not just a carbon copy of one
of them or a combination of both. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) a little sad. Someday her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) child
would be a stranger to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would be strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) ... but not as
strange as her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) own mother had become to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). Please don't let it be that way,
God. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) grow up and still love his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother.
Jack's typewriter began its irregular bursts again.
Still sitting in the chair beside Danny's reading table, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes
wander around her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son's room. The glider's wing had been neatly mended. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) desk
was piled high with picture books, coloring books, old Spiderman comic books
with the covers half torn off, Crayolas, and an untidy pile of Lincoln Logs. The
VW model was neatly placed above these lesser things, its shrink-wrap still
undisturbed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) father would be putting it together tomorrow night or
the night after if Danny went on at this rate, and never mind the end of the
week. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pictures of Pooh and Eyore and Christopher Robin were tacked neatly to
the wall, soon enough to be replaced with pin-ups and photographs of dopesmoking rock singers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) supposed. Innocence to experience. Human nature, baby.
Grab it and growl. Still it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) sad. Next year he (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) would be in school and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) would lose at least half of him (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>), maybe more, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) and Jack
had tried to have another one for a while when things had seemed to be going
well at Stovington, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) was on the pill again now. Things were too
uncertain. God knew where they would be in nine months.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) eyes fell on the wasps' nest.
It held the ultimate high place in Danny's room, resting on a large plastic
plate on the table by his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) didn't like it, even if it was empty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>)
wondered vaguely if it might have germs, thought to ask Jack, then decided he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
would laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) would ask the doctor tomorrow, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) could catch
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) with Jack out of the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) didn't like the idea of that thing,

<p/>constructed from the chewings and saliva of so many alien creatures, lying
within a foot of her (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) sleeping son's head.
The water in the bathroom was still running, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) got up and went into the
big bedroom to make sure everything was okay. Jack didn't look up; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was lost
in the world he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was making, staring at the typewriter, a filter cigarette
clamped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) teeth.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) knocked lightly on the closed bathroom room. <div class="bookquote">``You okay, doc? You awake?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No answer.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) tried the door. It was locked.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) was worried now. The lack of any sound beneath the steadily
running water made her (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) uneasy. <div class="bookquote">``Danny? Open the door, honey.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No answer.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jesus Christ, Wendy, I can't think if you're going to pound on the door all
night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Danny's locked himself in the bathroom and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) doesn't answer me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack came around the desk, looking put out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knocked on the door once, hard.
<div class="bookquote">``Open up, Danny. No games.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No answer.
Jack knocked harder. <div class="bookquote">``Stop fooling, doc. Bedtime's bedtime. Spanking if you
don't open up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) temper, she (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) thought, and was more afraid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had not touched
Danny in anger since that evening two years ago, but at this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sounded
angry enough to do it.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny, honey -- ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) began.
No answer. Only running water.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny, if you make me break this lock I can guarantee you you'll spend the
night sleeping on your belly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack warned.
Nothing.
<div class="bookquote">``Break it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) said, and suddenly it was hard to talk. <div class="bookquote">``Quick.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) raised one foot and brought it down hard against the door to the right of
the knob. The lock was a poor thing; it gave immediately and the door shuddered
open, banging the tiled bathroom wall and rebounding halfway.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) screamed.
The water was running full force in the basin. Beside it, a tube of Crest with
the cap off. Danny was sitting on the rim of the bathtub across the room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
toothbrush clasped limply in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) left hand, a thin foam of toothpaste around his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was staring, trancelike, into the mirror on the front of the medicine
cabinet above the washbasin. The expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face was one of drugged
horror, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) first thought was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was having some sort of epileptic
seizure, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) might have swallowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tongue.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny didn't answer. Guttural sounds came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) throat.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) was pushed aside so hard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Spiderman</b></font>) crashed into the towel rack, and
Jack was kneeling in front of the boy.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Danny, Danny!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fingers in front of Danny's
blank eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah-sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. <div class="bookquote">``Tournament play. Stroke. Nurrrrr ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh Jack my God what's wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack grabbed the boy's elbows and shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hard. Danny's head rolled limply
backward and then snapped forward like a balloon on a stick.
<div class="bookquote">``Roque. Stroke. Redrum.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) again, and Danny's eyes suddenly cleared. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) toothbrush fell
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand and onto the tiled floor with a small click.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) asked, looking around. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father kneeling before him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), Wendy
standing by the wall. <div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny asked again, with rising alarm. <div class="bookquote">``W-W-WuhWhat's wr-r-r -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't stutter!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack suddenly screamed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face. Danny cried out in
shock, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) body going tense, trying to draw away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
collapsed into tears. Stricken, Jack pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) close. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, doc. Please. Don't cry. I'm sorry. Everything's okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>The water ran ceaselessly in the basin, and Wendy felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had suddenly
stepped into some grinding nightmare where time ran backward, backward to the
time when her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) drunken husband had broken her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) son's arm and had then mewled over
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in almost the exact same words.
-LRB-Oh honey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, doc. Please. So sorry.-RRB-
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ran to them both, pried Danny out of Jack's arms somehow -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw the look
of angry reproach on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face but filed it away for later consideration-RRB-, and
lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) walked him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) back into the small bedroom, Danny's arms clasped
around her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) neck, Jack trailing them.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sat down on Danny's bed and rocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) back and forth, soothing him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) with
nonsensical words repeated over and over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked up at Jack and there was
only worry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) raised questioning eyebrows at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
head faintly.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Danny, Danny, Danny. 'S okay, doc. 'S fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>At last Danny was quiet, only faintly trembling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arms. Yet it was Jack
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) spoke to first, Jack who was now sitting beside them on the bed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) felt
the old faint pang
-LRB-It's him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) first and it's always been him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) first-RRB-
of jealousy. Jack had shouted at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had comforted him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), yet it was to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
father that Danny said,
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry if I was bad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing to be sorry for, doc.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack ruffled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hair. <div class="bookquote">``What the hell happened
in there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head slowly, dazedly. <div class="bookquote">``I ... I don't know. Why did you tell
me to stop stuttering, Daddy? I don't stutter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said heartily, but Wendy felt a cold finger touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
heart. Jack suddenly looked scared, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'d seen something that might just
have been a ghost.
<div class="bookquote">``Something about the timer...''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny muttered.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack was leaning forward, and Danny flinched in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arms.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack, you're scaring him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) voice was high, accusatory. It

<p/>suddenly came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) that they were all scared. But of what?
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know, I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny was saying to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``What ... what
did I say, Daddy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack muttered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) handkerchief from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) back pocket and
wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth with it. Wendy had a moment of that sickening time-is-runningbackward feeling again. It was a gesture she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) remembered well from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) drinking
days.
<div class="bookquote">``Why did you lock the door, Danny?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) asked gently. <div class="bookquote">``Why did you do that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tony,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Tony told me to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They exchanged a glance over the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Did Tony say why, son?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack asked quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``I was brushing my teeth and I was thinking about my reading,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said.
<div class="bookquote">``Thinking real hard. And ... and I saw Tony way down in the mirror. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)
had to show me again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You mean he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) was behind you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy asked.
<div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) was in the mirror.''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny was very emphatic on this point. <div class="bookquote">``Way down
deep. And then I went through the mirror. The next thing I remember Daddy was
shaking me and I thought I was being bad again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack winced as if struck.
<div class="bookquote">``No, doc,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``Tony told you to lock the door?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy asked, brushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hair.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) want to show you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny tensed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arms; it was as if the muscles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) body had turned into
something like piano wire. <div class="bookquote">``I don't remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said, distraught. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
remember. Don't ask me. I ... I don't remember nothing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said, alarmed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) began to rock him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) again. <div class="bookquote">``It's all right if
you don't remember, hon. Sure it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>At last Danny began to relax again.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you want me to stay a little while? Read you a story?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. Just the night light.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked shyly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``Would you stay,
Daddy? For a minute?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure, doc.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy sighed. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be in the living room, Jack.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) got up and watched as Danny slid under the covers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) seemed very small.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you sure you're okay, Danny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm okay. Just plug in Snoopy, Mom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) plugged in the night light, which showed Snoopy lying fast asleep on top
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snoopy</b></font>) doghouse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snoopy</b></font>) had never wanted a night light until they moved into the
Overlook, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Snoopy</b></font>) had specifically requested one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) turned off the lamp
and the overhead and looked back at them, the small white circle of Danny's
face, and Jack's above it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hesitated a moment
-LRB-and then I went through the mirror-RRB-
and then left them quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``You sleepy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack asked, brushing Danny's hair off his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) forehead.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Want a drink of water?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>There was silence for five minutes. Danny was still beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand. Thinking
the boy had dropped off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was about to get up and leave quietly when Danny
said from the brink of sleep:
<div class="bookquote">``Roque.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack turned back, all zero at the bone.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny -- ?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'd never hurt Mommy, would you, Daddy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Or me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Silence again, spinning out.
<div class="bookquote">``Daddy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tony came and told me about roque.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>), doc? What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember much. Except he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) said it was in innings. Like baseball. Isn't
that funny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack's heart was thudding dully in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) chest. How could the boy
possibly know a thing like that? Roque was played by innings, not like baseball
but like cricket.
<div class="bookquote">``Daddy ... ?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) was almost asleep now.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's redrum?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Red drum? Sounds like something an Indian might take on the warpath.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Silence.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, doc?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>But Danny was alseep, breathing in long, slow strokes. Jack sat looking down
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) for a moment, and a rush of love pushed through him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) like tidal water. Why
had he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) yelled at the boy like that? It was perfectly normal for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to stutter a
little. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been coming out of a daze or some weird kind of trance, and
stuttering was perfectly normal under those circumstances. Perfectly. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
hadn't said timer at all. It had been something else, nonsense, gibberish.
How had he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) known roque was played in innings? Had someone told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)? Ullman?
Hallorann?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) hands. They were made into tight, clenched fists of
tension
-LRB-god how i need a drink-RRB-
and the nails were digging into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) palms like tiny brands. Slowly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) forced
them to open.
<div class="bookquote">``I love you, Danny,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``God knows I do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) left the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) temper again, only a little, but enough to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) feel sick and afraid. A drink would blunt that feeling, oh yes. It
would blunt that
-LRB-Something about the timer-RRB-
and everything else. There was no mistake about those words at all. None. Each
had come out clear as a bell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) paused in the hallway, looking back, and

<p/>automatically wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) lips with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) handkerchief.

Their shapes were only dark silhouettes in the glow of the night light. Wendy,
wearing only panties, went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) bed and tucked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) in again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had kicked the
covers back. Jack stood in the doorway, watching as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) inner wrist
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) forehead.
<div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) feverish?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) cheek.

Boom... boom.. boomboomBOOMBOOM -- --
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fled the heavy, crashing, echoing sounds through twisting, mazelike
corridors, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) bare feet whispering over a deep-pile jungle of blue and black.
Each time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heard the roque mallet smash into the wall somewhere behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
wanted to scream aloud. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mustn't. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mustn't. A scream would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) away
and then

<p/>-LRB-then REDRUM-RRB-
-LRB-Come out here and take your medicine, you fucking crybaby!-RRB-
Oh and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could hear the owner of that voice coming, coming for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), charging
up the hall like a tiger in an alien blue-black jungle. A man-eater.
-LRB-Come out here, you little son of a bitch!-RRB-
If he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could get to the stairs going down, if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could get off this third
floor, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might be all right. Even the elevator. If he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could remember what had
been forgotten. But it was dark and in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) terror he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) orientation.
He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had turned down one corridor and then another, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) heart leaping into his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
mouth like a hot lump of ice, fearing that each turn would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) face to
face with the human tiger in these halls.
The booming was right behind him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) now, the awful hoarse shouting.
The whistle the head of the mallet made cutting through the air
-LRB-roque ... stroke ... roque ... stroke ... REDRUM-RRB-
before it crashed into the wall. The soft whisper of feet on the jungle
carpet. Panic squirting in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mouth like bitter juice.
-LRB-You will remember what was forgotten ... but would he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)? What was it?-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fled around another corner and saw with creeping, utter horror that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was
in a cul-de-sac. Locked doors frowned down at him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) from three sides. The west
wing. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was in the west wing and outside he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could hear the storm whooping and
screaming, seeming to choke on its own dark throat filled with snow.
He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) backed up against the wall, weeping with terror now, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) heart racing like
the heart of a rabbit caught in a snare. When his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) back was against the light
blue silk wallpaper with the embossed pattern of wavy lines, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) legs gave way
and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) collapsed to the carpet, hands splayed on the jungle of woven vines and
creepers, the breath whistling in and out of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) throat.
Louder. Louder.
There was a tiger in the hall, and now the tiger was just around the corner,
still crying out in that shrill and petulant and lunatic rage, the roque mallet
slamming, because this tiger walked on two legs and it was --
He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) woke with a sudden indrawn gasp, sitting bolt upright in bed, eyes wide and
staring into the darkness, hands crossed in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) face.
Something on one hand. Crawling.
Wasps. Three of them.
They stung him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) then, seeming to needle all at once, and that was when all the
images broke apart and fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in a dark flood and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) began to shriek into
the dark, the wasps clinging to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) left hand, stinging again and again.
The lights went on and Daddy was standing there in his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) shorts, his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) eyes
glaring. Mommy behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>), sleepy and scared.
<div class="bookquote">``Get them off me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny screamed.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh my God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) saw.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack, what's wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)? What's wrong?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) didn't answer her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ran to the bed, scooped up Danny's pillow, and
slapped Danny's thrashing left hand with it. Again. Again. Wendy saw lumbering,
insectile forms rise into the air, droning.
<div class="bookquote">``Get a magazine!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) yelled over his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Kill them!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wasps?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, and for a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was inside herself, almost detached in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) realization. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mind crosspatched, and knowledge was connected to

<p/>emotion. <div class="bookquote">``Wasps, oh Jesus, Jack, you said -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shut the fuck up and kill them!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) roared. <div class="bookquote">``Will you do what I say!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>One of them had landed on Danny's reading desk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) took a coloring book off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) worktable and slammed it down on the wasp. It left a viscous brown smear.
<div class="bookquote">``There's another one on the curtain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said, and ran out past her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) with Danny
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) arms.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) took the boy into their bedroom and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) on Wendy's side of the
makeshift double. <div class="bookquote">``Lie right there, Danny. Don't come back until I tell you.
Understand?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face puffed and streaked with tears, Danny nodded.
<div class="bookquote">``That's my brave boy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack ran back down the hall to the stairs. Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) heard the coloring
book slap twice, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wife screamed in pain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't slow but went
down the stairs two by two into the darkened lobby. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went through Ullman's
office into the kitchen, slamming the heavy part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thigh into the corner of
Ullman's oak desk, barely feeling it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) slapped on the kitchen overheads and
crossed to the sink. The washed dishes from supper were still heaped up in the
drainer, where Wendy had left them to drip-dry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) snatched the big Pyrex bowl
off the top. A dish fell to the floor and exploded. Ignoring it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) turned and
ran back through the office and up the stairs.
Wendy was standing outside Danny's door, breathing hard. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face was the
color of table linen. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) eyes were shiny and flat; her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hair hung damply against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) neck. <div class="bookquote">``I got all of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said dully, <div class="bookquote">``but one stung me. Jack, you said
they were all dead.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) began to cry.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) slipped past her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) without answering and carried the Pyrex bowl over to the
nest by Danny's bed. It was still. Nothing there. On the outside, anyway. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
slammed the bowl down over the nest.
<div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Come on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They went back into their bedroom.
<div class="bookquote">``Where did it get you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``My ... on my wrist.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let's see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) showed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). Just above the bracelet of lines between wrist and palm,
there was a small circular hole. The flesh around it was puffing up.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you allergic to stings?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Think hard! If you are, Danny might
be. The fucking little bastards got him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) five or six times.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, more calmly. <div class="bookquote">``I ... I just hate them, that's all. Hate
them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny was sitting on the foot of the bed, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) left hand and looking at
them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes, circled with the white of shock, looked at Jack reproachfully.
<div class="bookquote">``Daddy, you said you killed them all. My hand ... it really hurts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let's see it, doc ... no, I'm not going to touch it. That would make it
hurt even more. Just hold it out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did and Wendy moaned. <div class="bookquote">``Oh Danny ... oh, your poor hand!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>Later the doctor would count eleven separate stings. Now all they saw was a
dotting of small holes, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) palm and fingers had been sprinkled with
grains of red pepper. The swelling was bad. His (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hand had begun to look like one
of those cartoon images where Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck had just slammed himself

<p/>with a hammer.
<div class="bookquote">``Wendy, go get that spray stuff in the bathroom,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunny</b></font>) said.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) went after it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunny</b></font>) sat down next to Danny and slipped an arm around his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
shoulders.
<div class="bookquote">``After we spray your hand, I want to take some Polaroids of it, doc. Then you
sleep the rest of the night with us, Tay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. <div class="bookquote">``But why are you going to take pictures?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So maybe we can sue the ass out of some people.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy came back with a spray tube in the shape of a chemical fire
extinguisher.
<div class="bookquote">``This won't hurt, honey,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, taking off the cap.
Danny held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sprayed both sides until it gleamed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) let
out a long, shuddery sigh.
<div class="bookquote">``Does it smart?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``No. Feels better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now these. Crunch them up.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) held out five orangeflavored baby aspirin.
Danny took them and popped them into his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth one by one.
<div class="bookquote">``Isn't that a lot of aspirin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack asked.
<div class="bookquote">``It's a lot of stings,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) snapped at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) angrily. <div class="bookquote">``You go and get rid of
that nest, John Torrance. Right now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just a minute.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went to the dresser and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) Polaroid Square Shooter out of the top
drawer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) rummaged deeper and found some flashcubes.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack, what are you doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) asked, a little hysterically.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s gonna take some pictures of my hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said gravely, <div class="bookquote">``and then
we're gonna sue the ass out of some people. Right, Dad?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said grimly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had found the flash attachment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) jabbed it
onto the camera. <div class="bookquote">``Hold it out, son. I figure about five thousand dollars a
sting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What are you talking about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy nearly screamed.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I followed the directions on that fucking bug
bomb. We're going to sue them. The damn thing was defective. Had to have been.
How else can you explain this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said in a small voice.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) took four pictures, pulling out each covered print for Wendy to time on the
small locket watch she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wore around her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) neck. Danny, fascinated with the idea
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stung hand might be worth thousands and thousands of dollars, began to
lose some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fright and take an active interest. The hand throbbed dully,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had a small headache.
When Jack had put the camera away and spread the prints out on top of the
dresser to dry, Wendy said: <div class="bookquote">``Should we take him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to the doctor tonight?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not unless he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s really in pain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``If a person has a strong allergy
to wasp venom, it hits within thirty seconds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hits? What do you -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A coma. Or convulsions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh. Oh my Jesus.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cupped her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) elbows and hugged herself,
looking pale and wan.
<div class="bookquote">``How do you feel, son? Think you could sleep?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div><p/>Danny blinked at them. The nightmare had faded to a dull, featureless
background in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was still frightened.
<div class="bookquote">``If I can sleep with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said. <div class="bookquote">``Oh honey, I'm so sorry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's okay, Mommy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) began to cry again, and Jack put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``Wendy, I
swear to you that I followed the directions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will you get rid of it in the morning? Please?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course I will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>The three of them got in bed together, and Jack was about to snap off the
light over the bed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) paused and pushed the covers back instead. <div class="bookquote">``Want a
picture of the nest, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come right back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went to the dresser, got the camera and the last flashcube, and gave Danny
a closed thumb-and-forefinger circle. Danny smiled and gave it back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
good hand.
Quite a kid he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thought as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) walked down to Danny's room. All of that and then
some.
The overhead was still on. Jack crossed to the bunk setup, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) glanced
at the table beside it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) skin crawled into goose flesh. The short hairs on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) neck prickled and tried to stand erect.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could hardly see the nest through the clear Pyrex bowl. The inside of the
glass was crawling with wasps. It was hard to tell how many. Fifty at least.
Maybe a hundred.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heart thudding slowly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) chest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pictures and then set the
camera down to wait for them to develop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) lips with the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
hand. One thought played over and over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mind, echoing with
-LRB-You lost your temper. You lost your temper. You lost your temper.-RRB-
an almost superstitious dread. They had come back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had killed the wasps but
they had come back.
In his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heard himself screaming into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) frightened, crying son's face:
Don't stutter!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) lips again.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went to Danny's worktable, rummaged in its drawers, and came up with a big
jigsaw puzzle with a fiberboard backing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) took it over to the bedtable and
carefully slid the bowl and the nest onto it. The wasps buzzed angrily inside
their prison. Then, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hand firmly on top of the bowl so it wouldn't
slip, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went out into the hall.
<div class="bookquote">``Coming to bed, Jack?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Coming to bed, Daddy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Have to go downstairs for a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) voice light.
How had it happened? How in God's name?
The bomb sure hadn't been a dud. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had seen the thick white smoke start to
puff out of it when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had pulled the ring. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had gone up two hours
later, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had shaken a drift of small dead bodies out of the hole in the top.
Then how? Spontaneous regeneration?
That was crazy. Seventeenth-century bullshit. Insects didn't regenerate. And

<p/>even if wasp eggs could mature full-grown insects in twelve hours, this wasn't
the season in which the queen laid. That happened in April or May. Fall was
their dying time.
A living contradiction, the wasps buzzed furiously under the bowl.
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) took them downstairs and through the kitchen. In back there was a door
which gave on the outside. A cold night wind blew against his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) nearly naked body,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) feet went numb almost instantly against the cold concrete of the
platform he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was standing on, the platform where milk deliveries were made during
the hotel's operating season. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) put the puzzle and the bowl down carefully, and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stood up he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looked at the thermometer nailed outside the door. FRESH UP
WITH 7-up, the thermometer said, and the mercury stood at an even twenty-five
degrees. The cold would kill them by morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went in and shut the door
firmly. After a moment's thought he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) locked it, too.
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) crossed the kitchen again and shut off the lights. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stood in the darkness
for a moment, thinking, wanting a drink. Suddenly the hotel seemed full of a
thousand stealthy sounds: creakings and groans and the sly sniff of the wind
under the eaves where more wasps' nests might be hanging like deadly fruit.
They had come back.
And suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) didn't like the Overlook so well anymore, as if
it wasn't wasps that had stung his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) son, wasps that had miraculously lived
through the bug bomb assault, but the hotel itself.
His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) last thought before going upstairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife and son
-LRB-from now on you will hold your temper. No Mattes What.-RRB-
was firm and hard and sure.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went down the hall to them he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lips with the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand.

THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE
Stripped to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) underpants, lying on the examination table, Danny Torrance
looked very small. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) was looking up at Dr. -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Just call me Bill'' (<font color='red'><b>Dr.</b></font>)</div>-RRB- Edmonds, who
was wheeling a large black machine up beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>). Danny rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes to get a
better look at it.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't let it scare you, guy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmonds/Bill '' -RRB- Edmonds/Bill Edmonds</b></font>)</div>Bill Edmonds said. <div class="bookquote">``It's an
electroencephalograph, and it doesn't hurt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Electro -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We call it EEG for short. I'm going to hook a bunch of wires to your head --
no, not stick them in, only tape them -- and the pens in this part of the gadget
will record your brain waves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Like on `The Six Million Dollar Man'?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``About the same. Would you like to be like Steve Austin when you grow up?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said as the nurse began to tape the wires to a number of tiny

<p/>shaved spots on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) scalp. <div class="bookquote">``My daddy says that someday he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>)'ll get a short circuit
and then he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>)'ll be up sh ... he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>)'ll be up the creek.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know that creek well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Edmonds</b></font>)</div>Dr. Edmonds said amiably. <div class="bookquote">``I've been up it a few

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Like what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Like for instance if you have epilepsy. That's a little problem where -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I know what epilespy is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure. There was a kid in my nursery school back in Vermont -- I went to nursery
school when I was a little kid -- and he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) had it. He (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) wasn't supposed to use the
flashboard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What was that, Dan?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) had turned on the machine. Thin lines began to trace
their way across graph paper.
<div class="bookquote">``It had all these lights, all different colors. And when you turned it on,
some colors would flash but not all. And you had to count the colors and if you
pushed the right button, you could turn it off. Brent couldn't use that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's because bright flashing lights sometimes cause an epileptic seizure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You mean using the flashboard might've made Brent pitch a fit?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edmonds/Bill '' -RRB- Edmonds/Bill Edmonds</b></font>)</div>Edmonds and the nurse exchanged a brief, amused glance. <div class="bookquote">``Inelegantly but
accurately put, Danny.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I said you're right, except you should say `seizure' instead of `pitch a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Danny, when you have these ... whatever they ares, do you ever recall
seeing bright flashing lights before?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No... ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Huh-uh.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How about a funny smell, maybe like oranges or sawdust? Or a smell like

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Have I got epilepsy, Dr. Bill?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't think so, Danny. Just lie still. Almost done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Edmonds</b></font>)</div>The machine hummed and scratched for another five minutes and then Dr. Edmonds
shut it off.
<div class="bookquote">``All done, guy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmonds/Bill '' -RRB- Edmonds/Bill Edmonds</b></font>)</div>Edmonds said briskly. <div class="bookquote">``Let Sally get those electrodes off you

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmonds/Bill '' -RRB- Edmonds/Bill Edmonds</b></font>)</div>Edmonds ripped off the long curl of paper the machine had extruded and went
into the next room, looking at it.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm going to prick your arm just a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>the nurse said after Danny had

<p/>pulled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pants. <div class="bookquote">``It's to make sure you don't have TB.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They gave me that at my school just last year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said without much hope.
<div class="bookquote">``But that was a long time ago and you're a big boy now, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I guess so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny sighed, and offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) arm up for sacrifice.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shirt and shoes on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went through the sliding door and into
Dr. Edmonds's office. Edmonds was sitting on the edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) desk, swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>)
legs thoughtfully.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi, Danny.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hi.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How's that hand now?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) pointed at Danny's left hand, which was lightly
bandaged.
<div class="bookquote">``Pretty good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good. I looked at your EEG and it seems fine. But I'm going to send it to a
friend of mine in Denver who makes his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) living reading those things. I just want
to make sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell me about Tony, Dan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny shuffled his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)'s just an invisible friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)
up. To keep me company.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edmonds/Bill '' -RRB- Edmonds/Bill Edmonds</b></font>)</div>Edmonds laughed and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) hands on Danny's shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``Now that's what your
Mom and Dad say. But this is just between us, guy. I'm your doctor. Tell me the
truth and I'll promise not to tell them unless you say I can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny thought about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked at Edmonds and then, with a small effort of
concentration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tried to catch Edmonds's thoughts or at least the color of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>)
mood. And suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) got an oddly comforting image in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) head: file cabinets,
their doors sliding shut one after another, locking with a click. Written on the
small tabs in the center of each door was: A-C, SECRET; D-G, SECRET; and so on.
This made Danny feel a little easier.
Cautiously he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I don't know who Tony is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) your age?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)'s at least eleven. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) might be even older. I've never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)
right up close. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) might be old enough to drive a car.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You just see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) at a distance, huh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) always comes just before you pass out?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't pass out. It's like I go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) shows me things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What kind of things?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny debated for a moment and then told Edmonds about Daddy's
trunk with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) writing in it, and about how the movers hadn't lost it
between Vermont and Colorado after all. It had been right under the stairs all along.
<div class="bookquote">``And your daddy found it where Tony said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) would?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, sir. Only Tony didn't tell me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) showed me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I understand. Danny, what did Tony show you last night? When you locked
yourself in the bathroom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said quickly.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you sure?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``A moment ago I said you locked the bathroom door. But that wasn't right, was

<p/>it? Tony locked the door.''
``No, sir. Tony couldn't lock the door because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) isn't real. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) wanted me to
do it, so I did. I locked it.''
``Does Tony always show you where lost things are?''
``No, sir. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) shows me things that are going to happen.''
``Really?''
``Sure. Like one time Tony showed me the amusements and wild animal park in Great Barrington.
Tony said Daddy was going to take me there for my birthday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) did, too.''
``What else does he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) show you?''
Danny frowned. ``Signs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)'s always showing me stupid old signs. And I can't
read them, hardly ever.''
``Why do you suppose Tony would do that, Danny?''
``I don't know.'' Danny brightened. ``But my daddy and mommy are teaching me to
read, and I'm trying real hard.''
``So you can read Tony's signs.''
``Well, I really want to learn. But that too, yeah.''
``Do you like Tony, Danny?''
Danny looked at the tile floor and said nothing.
``Danny?''
``It's hard to tell,'' Danny said. ``I used to. I used to hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'d come every
day, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) always showed me good things, especially since Mommy and Daddy
don't think about DIVORCE anymore.'' Dr. Edmonds's gaze sharpened, but Danny
didn't notice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was looking hard at the floor, concentrating on expressing
himself. ``But now whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) comes he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shows me bad things. Awful things. Like
in the bathroom last night. The things he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shows me, they sting me like those
wasps stung me. Only Tony's things sting me up here.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) cocked a finger gravely
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) temple, a small boy unconsciously burlesquing suicide.
``What things, Danny?''
``I can't remember!'' Danny cried out, agonized. ``I'd tell you if I could! It's
like I can't remember because it's so bad I don't want to remember. All I can
remember when I wake up is REDRUM.''
``Red drum or red rum?''
``Rum. ''
``What's that, Danny?''
``I don't know.''
``Danny?''
``Yes, sir?''
``Can you make Tony come now?''
``I don't know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) doesn't always come. I don't even know if I want him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) to come
anymore.''
``Try, Danny. I'll be right here.''
Danny looked at Edmonds doubtfully. Edmonds nodded encouragement.
Danny let out a long, sighing breath and nodded. ``But I don't know if it will
work. I never did it with anyone looking at me before. And Tony doesn't always
come, anyway.''
``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) doesn't, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) doesn't,'' Edmonds said. ``I just want you to try.''
<div class="bookquote">``Okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>mommy daddy</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) gaze to Edmonds's slowly swinging loafers and cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind

<p/>outward toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mommy and daddy. They were here someplace ... right beyond
that wall with the picture on it, as a matter of fact. In the waiting room where
they had come in. Sitting side by side but not talking. Leafing through
magazines. Worried. About him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) concentrated harder, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) brow furrowing, trying to get Into the feeling of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mommy's thoughts. It was always harder when they weren't right there in the
room with him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) began to get it. Mommy was thinking about a sister. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>)
sister. The sister was dead. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mommy was thinking that was the main thing that
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>mommy</b></font>) mommy into such a
-LRB-bitch?-RRB-
into such an old biddy. Because her (<font color='blue'><b>mommy</b></font>) sister had died. As a little girl she (<font color='blue'><b>mommy</b></font>) was
-LRB-hit by a car oh god i could never stand anything like that again like aileen
but what if he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>)'s sick really sick cancer spinal meningitis leukemia brain tumor
like john gunther's son or muscular dystrophy oh jeez kids his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) age get leukemia
all the time radium treatments chemotherapy we couldn't afford anything like
that but of course they just can't turn you out to die on the street can they
and anyway he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s all right all right all right you really shouldn't let yourself
think-RRB-
-LRB-Danny -- -RRB-
-LRB-about aileen and-RRB-
-LRB-Dannee -- -RRB-
-LRB-that car-RRB-
-LRB-Dannee -- -RRB-
But Tony wasn't there. Only his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) voice. And as it faded, Danny followed it down
into darkness, falling and tumbling down some magic hole between Dr. Bill's
swinging loafers, past a loud knocking sound, further, a bathtub cruised
silently by in the darkness with some horrible thing lolling in it, past a sound
like sweetly chiming church bells, past a clock under a dome of glass.
Then the dark was pierced feebly by a single light, festooned with cobwebs.
The weak glow disclosed a stone floor that looked damp and unpleasant. Somewhere
not far distant was a steady mechanical roaring sound, but muted, not
frightening. Soporific. It was the thing that would be forgotten, Danny thought
with dreamy surprise.
As his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes adjusted to the gloom he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could see Tony just ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), a
silhouette. Tony was looking at something and Danny strained his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) eyes to see
what it was.
-LRB-Your daddy. See your daddy?-RRB-
Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) did. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) have missed him (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>), even in the basement light's
feeble glow? Daddy was kneeling on the floor, casting the beam of a flashlight
over old cardboard boxes and wooden crates. The cardboard boxes were mushy and
old; some of them had split open and spilled drifts of paper onto the floor.
Newspapers, books, printed pieces of paper that looked like bills. His (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) daddy was
examining them with great interest. And then Daddy looked up and shone his (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>)
flashlight in another direction. Its beam of light impaled another book, a large
white one bound with gold string. The cover looked like white leather. It was a
scrapbook. Danny suddenly needed to cry out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy, to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) to leave
that book alone, that some books should not be opened. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy was
climbing toward it.

<p/>The mechanical roaring sound, which he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) now recognized as the boiler at the
Overlook which Daddy checked three or four times every day, had developed an
ominous, rhythmic hitching. It began to sound like ... like pounding. And the
smell of mildew and wet, rotting paper was changing to something else -- the high,
junipery smell of the Bad Stuff. It hung around his (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) daddy like a vapor as he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>)
reached for the book ... and grasped it.
Tony was somewhere in the darkness
-LRB-This inhuman place makes human monsters. This inhuman place-RRB-
repeating the same incomprehensible thing over and over.
-LRB-makes human monsters.-RRB-
Falling through darkness again, now accompanied by the heavy, pounding thunder
that was no longer the boiler but the sound of a whistling mallet striking silkpapered walls, knocking out whiffs of plaster dust. Crouching helplessly on the
blue-black woven jungle rug.
-LRB-Come out-RRB-
-LRB-This inhuman place-RRB-
-LRB-and take your medicine!-RRB-
-LRB-makes human monsters.-RRB-
With a gasp that echoed in his (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>) own head he (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>) jerked himself out of the darkness.
Hands were on him (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>) and at first he (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>) shrank back, thinking that the dark thing in
the Overlook of Tony's world had somehow followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) back into the world of
real things -- and then Dr. Edmonds was saying: <div class="bookquote">``You're all right, Danny. You're
all right. Everything is fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Edmonds</b></font>)</div>Danny recognized the doctor, then his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) surroundings in the office. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) began to
shudder helplessly. Edmonds held him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).
When the reaction began to subside, Edmonds asked, <div class="bookquote">``You said something about
monsters, Danny -- what was it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edmonds/Bill '' -RRB- Edmonds/Bill Edmonds</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This inhuman place,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) said gutturally. <div class="bookquote">``Tony told me... this inhuman
place ... makes ... makes ...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Can't remember.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Try!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did Tony come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) show you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dark. Pounding. I don't remember.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where were you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Leave me alone! I don't remember! Leave me alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) began to sob helplessly
in fear and frustration. It was all gone, dissolved into a sticky mess like a
wet bundle of paper, the memory unreadable.
Edmonds went to the water cooler and got him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) a paper cup of water. Danny drank
it and Edmonds got him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) another one.
<div class="bookquote">``Better?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Danny, I don't want to badger you ... tease you about this, I mean. But can
you remember anything about before Tony came?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My mommy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said slowly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mommy</b></font>)'s worried about me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mothers always are, guy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``No ... she (<font color='blue'><b>mommy</b></font>) had a sister that died when she (<font color='blue'><b>mommy</b></font>) was a little girl. Aileen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aileen</b></font>)

<p/>was thinking about how Aileen got hit by a car and that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Aileen</b></font>) worried about
me. I don't remember anything else.''
Edmonds was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) sharply. ``Just now she (<font color='blue'><b>Aileen</b></font>) was thinking that? Out in
the waiting room?''
``Yes, sir.''
``Danny, how would you know that?''
``I don't know,'' Danny said wanly. ``The shining, I guess.''
``The what?''
Danny shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head very slowly. ``I'm awful tired. Can't I go see my mommy
and daddy? I don't want to answer any more questions. I'm tired. And my stomach
hurts.''
``Are you going to throw up?''
``No, sir. I just want to go see my mommy and daddy.''
``Okay, Dan.'' Edmonds stood up. ``You go on out and see them for a minute, then
send them in so I can talk to them. Okay?.''
``Yes, sir.''
``There are books out there to look at. You like books, don't you?''
``Yes, sir,'' Danny said dutifully.
``You're a good boy, Danny.''
Danny gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) a faint smile.
* * *
``I can't find a thing wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>),'' Dr. Edmonds said to the Torrances. ``Not
physically. Mentally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s bright and rather too imaginative. It happens.
Children have to grow into their imaginations like a pair of oversized shoes.
Danny's is still way too big for him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). Ever had his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) IQ tested?''
``I don't believe in them,'' Jack said. ``They straight-jacket the expectations
of both parents and teachers.''
Dr. Edmonds nodded. ``That may be. But if you did test him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), I think you'd find
he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s right off the scale for his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) age group. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) verbal ability, for a boy who is
five going on six, is amazing.''
``We don't talk down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>),'' Jack said with a trace of pride.
``I doubt if you've ever had to in order to make yourself understood.'' Edmonds
paused, fiddling with a pen. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went into a trance while I was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). At my
request. Exactly as you described him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) in the bathroom last night. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
muscles went lax, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) body slumped, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyeballs rotated outward. Textbook autohypnosis. I was amazed. I still am.''
The Torrances sat forward. ``What happened?'' Wendy asked tensely, and Edmonds
carefully related Danny's trance, the muttered phrase from which Edmonds had
only been able to pluck the word ``monsters,'' the ``dark,'' the ``pounding.'' The
aftermath of tears, near-hysteria, and nervous stomach.
``Tony again,'' Jack said.
``What does it mean?'' Wendy asked. ``Have you any idea?''
``A few. You might not like them.''
``Go ahead anyway,'' Jack told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).
``From what Danny told me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) `invisible friend' was truly a friend until you
folks moved out here from New England. Tony has only become a threatening figure

<p/>since that move. The pleasant interludes have become nightmarish, even more
frightening to your son because he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) can't remember exactly what the nightmares
are about. That's common enough. We all remember our pleasant dreams more
clearly than the scary ones. There seems to be a buffer somewhere between the
conscious and the subconscious, and one hell of a bluenose lives in there. This
censor only lets through a small amount, and often what does come through is
only symbolic. That's oversimplified Freud, but it does pretty much describe
what we know of the mind's interaction with itself.''
``You think moving has upset Danny that badly?'' Wendy asked.
``It may have, if the move took place under traumatic circumstances,'' Edmonds
said. ``Did it?''
Wendy and Jack exchanged a glance.
``I was teaching at a prep school,'' Jack said slowly. ``I lost my job.''
``I see,'' Edmonds said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) put the pen he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) bad been playing with firmly back in
its holder. ``There's more here, I'm afraid. It may be painful to you. Your son
seems to believe you two have seriously contemplated divorce. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) spoke of it in
an offhand way, but only because he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) believes you are no longer considering it.''
Jack's mouth dropped open, and Wendy recoiled as if slapped. The blood drained
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face.
``We never even discussed it!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. ``Not in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), not even in
front of each other! We -- ''
``I think it's best if you understand everything, Doctor,'' Jack said. ``Shortly
after Danny was born, I became an alcoholic. I'd had a drinking problem all the
way through college, it subsided a little after Wendy and I met, cropped up
worse than ever after Danny was born and the writing I consider to be my real
work was going badly. When Danny was three and a half, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) spilled some beer on a
bunch of papers I was working on ... papers I was shuffling around, anyway ...
and I ... well ... oh shit.'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) voice broke, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes remained dry
and unflinching. ``It sounds so goddam beastly said out loud. I broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) arm
turning him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) around to spank him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). Three months later I gave up drinking. I
haven't touched it since.''
``I see,'' Edmonds said neutrally. ``I knew the arm had been broken, of course.
It was set well.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) pushed back from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) desk a little and crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) legs.
``If I may be frank, it's obvious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s been in no way abused since then.
Other than the stings, there's nothing on him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) but the normal bruises and scabs
that any kid has in abundance.''
``Of course not,'' Wendy said hotly. ``Jack didn't mean-- ''
``No, Wendy,'' Jack said. ``I meant to do it. I guess someplace inside I really
did mean to do that to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). Or something even worse.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) looked back at Edmonds
again. ``You know something, Doctor? This is the first time the word divorce has
been mentioned between us. And alcoholism. And child-beating. Three firsts in
five minutes.''
``That may be at the root of the problem,'' Edmonds said. ``I am not a
psychiatrist. If you want Danny to see a child psychiatrist, I can recommend a
good one who works out of the Mission Ridge Medical Center in Boulder. But I am
fairly confident of my diagnosis. Danny is an intelligent, imaginative,
perceptive boy. I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would have been as upset by your marital
problems as you believed. Small children are great accepters. They don't

<p/>understand shame, or the need to hide things.''
Jack was studying his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands. Wendy took one of them and squeezed it.
``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sensed the things that were wrong. Chief among them from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) point of
view was not the broken arm but the broken -- or breaking -- link between you two.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) mentioned divorce to me, but not the broken arm. When my nurse mentioned the
set to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) simply shrugged if off. It was no pressure thing. `It happened a
long time ago' is what I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) said.''
``That kid,'' Jack muttered. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) jaws were clamped together, the muscles in the
cheeks standing out. ``We don't deserve him (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>).''
``You have him (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>), all the same,'' Edmonds said dryly. ``At any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) retires
into a fantasy world from time to time. Nothing unusual about that; lots of kids
do. As I recall, I had my own invisible friend when I was Danny's age, a talking
rooster named Chug-Chug. Of course no one could see Chug-Chug but me. I had two
older brothers who often left me behind, and in such a situation Chug-Chug came
in mighty handy. And of course you two must understand why Danny's invisible
friend is named Tony instead of Mike or Hal or Dutch.''
``Yes,'' Wendy said.
``Have you ever pointed it out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>)?''
``No,'' Jack said. ``Should we?''
``Why bother? Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) realize it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) own time, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) own logic. You see,
Danny's fantasies were considerably deeper than those that grow around the
ordinary invisible friend syndrome, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) needed Tony that much more.
Tony would come and show him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) pleasant things. Sometimes amazing things. Always
good things. Once Tony showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) where Daddy's lost trunk was ... under the
stairs. Another time Tony showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) that Mommy and Daddy were going to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)
to an amusement park for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) birthday -- ''
``At Great Barrington!'' Wendy cried. ``But how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) know those things? It's
eerie, the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) comes out with sometimes. Almost as if -- ''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) had second sight?'' Edmonds asked, smiling.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) was born with a caul,'' Wendy said weakly.
Edmonds's smile became a good, hearty laugh. Jack and Wendy exchanged a glance
and then also smiled, both of them amazed at how easy it was. Danny's occasional
``lucky guesses'' about things was something else they had not discussed much.
``Next you'll be telling me he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) can levitate,'' Edmonds said, still smiling. ``No,
no, no, I'm afraid not. It's not extrasensory but good old human perception,
which in Danny's case is unusually keen. Mr. Torrance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) knew your trunk was
under the stairs because you had looked everywhere else. Process of elimination,
what? It's so simple Ellery Queen would laugh at it. Sooner or later you would
have thought of it yourself.
<div class="bookquote">``As for the amusement park at Great Barrington, whose idea was that
originally? Yours or his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>), of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said. <div class="bookquote">``They advertised on all the morning children's
programs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) was wild to go. But the thing is, Doctor, we couldn't afford to
take him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). And we had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then a men's magazine I'd sold a story to back in 1971 sent a check for fifty
dollars,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``They were reprinting the story in an annual, or something.
So we decided to spend it on Danny.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edmonds/Bill '' -RRB- Edmonds/Bill Edmonds</b></font>)</div>Edmonds shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``Wish fulfillment plus a lucky coincidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Goddammit, I bet that's just right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said.
Edmonds smiled a little. <div class="bookquote">``And Danny himself told me that Tony often showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)
things that never occurred. Visions based on faulty perception, that's all.
Danny is doing subconsciously what these so-called mystics and mind readers do
quite consciously and cynically. I admire him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) for it. If life doesn't cause him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
to retract his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) antennae, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'ll be quite a man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy nodded -- of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought Danny would be quite a man -- but the
doctor's explanation struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) as glib. It tasted more like margarine than
butter. Edmonds had not lived with them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) had not been there when Danny found
lost buttons, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) that maybe the TV Guide was under the bed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) better wear his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) rubbers to nursery school even though the sun was out
... and later that day they had walked home under her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) umbrella through the
pouring rain. Edmonds couldn't know of the curious way Danny had of preguessing
them both. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would decide to have an unusual evening cup of tea, go out in the
kitchen and find her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cup out with a tea bag in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would remember that the
books were due at the library and find them all neatly piled up on the hall
table, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) library card on top. Or Jack would take it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head to wax the
Volkswagen and find Danny already out there, listening to tinny top-forty music
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) crystal radio as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sat on the curb to watch.
Aloud she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Then why the nightmares now? Why did Tony tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) to lock
the bathroom door?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I believe it's because Tony has outlived his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) usefulness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmonds/Bill '' -RRB- Edmonds/Bill Edmonds</b></font>)</div>Edmonds said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)
was born -- Tony, not Danny -- at a time when you and your husband were straining to
keep your marriage together. Your husband was drinking too much. There was the
incident of the broken arm. The ominous quiet between you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Ominous quiet, yes, that phrase was the real thing, anyway. The stiff, tense
meals where the only conversation had been please pass the butter or Danny, eat
the rest of your carrots or may I be excused, please. The nights when Jack was
gone and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had lain down, dry-eyed, on the couch while Danny watched TV. The
mornings when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and Jack had stalked around each other like two angry cats
with a quivering, frightened mouse between them. It all rang true;
-LRB-dear God, do old scars ever stop hurting?-RRB-
horribly, horribly true.
Edmonds resumed, <div class="bookquote">``But things have changed. You know, schizoid behavior is a
pretty common thing in children. It's accepted, because all we adults have this
unspoken agreement that children are lunatics. They have invisible friends. They
may go and sit in the closet when they're depressed, withdrawing from the world.
They attach talismanic importance to a special blanket, or a teddy bear, or a
stuffed tiger. They suck their thumbs. When an adult sees things that aren't
there, we consider him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) ready for the rubber room. When a child says he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)'s seen a
troll in his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) bedroom or a vampire outside the window, we simply smile
indulgently. We have a one-sentence explanation that explains the whole range of
such phenomena in children -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edmonds/Bill '' -RRB- Edmonds/Bill Edmonds</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)'ll grow out of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said.
Edmonds blinked. <div class="bookquote">``My very words,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) said. ``Yes. Now I would guess that Danny
was in a pretty good position to develop a full-fledged psychosis. Unhappy home
life, a big imagination, the invisible friend who was so real to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
nearly became real to you. Instead of `growing out of' his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) childhood

<p/>schizophrenia, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might well have grown into it.''
``And become autistic?'' Wendy asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had read about autism. The word itself
frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>); it sounded like dread and white silence.
``Possible but not necessarily. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might simply have entered Tony's world
someday and never come back to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) calls `real things.' ''
``God,'' Jack said.
``But now the basic situation has changed drastically. Mr. Torrance no longer
drinks. You are in a new place where conditions have forced the three of you
into a tighter family unit than ever before -- certainly tighter than my own,
where my wife and kids may see me for only two or three hours a day. To my mind,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) is in the perfect healing situation. And I think the very fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) is
able to differentiate so sharply between Tony's world and `real things' says a
lot about the fundamentally healthy state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) says that you two are
no longer considering divorce. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) as right as I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) is?''
``Yes,'' Wendy said, and Jack squeezed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand tightly, almost painfully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
squeezed back.
Edmonds nodded. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) really doesn't need Tony anymore. Danny is flushing him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) system. Tony no longer brings pleasant visions but hostile nightmares
that are too frightening for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) to remember except fragmentarily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)
internalized Tony during a difficult -- desperate -- life situation, and Tony is not
leaving easily. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) is leaving. Your son is a little like a junkie kicking
the habit.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) stood up, and the Torrances stood also.
``As I said, I'm not a psychiatrist. If the nightmares are still continuing
when your job at the Overlook ends next spring, Mr. Torrance, I would strongly
urge you to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) to this man in Boulder.''
``I will.''
``Well, let's go out and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) can go home,'' Edmonds said.
``I want to thank you,'' Jack told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) painfully. ``I feel better about all this
than I have in a very long time.''
``So do I,'' Wendy said.
At the door, Edmonds paused and looked at Wendy. ``Do you or did you have a
sister, Mrs. Torrance? Named Aileen?''
Wendy looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>), surprised. ``Yes, I did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) was killed outside our home
in Somersworth, New Hampshire, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) was six and I was ten. She (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) chased a ball
into the street and was struck by a delivery van.''
``Does Danny know that?''
``I don't know. I don't think so.''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) says you were thinking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) in the waiting room.''
``I was,'' Wendy said slowly. ``For the first time in ... oh, I don't know how
long.''
``Does the word `redrum' mean anything to either of you?''
Wendy shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) head but Jack said, ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mentioned that word last night, just
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went to sleep. Red drum.''
``No, rum,'' Edmonds corrected. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was quite emphatic about that. Rum. As in
the drink. The alcoholic drink.''
``Oh,'' Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``It fits in, doesn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) handkerchief out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
back pocket and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) lips with it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does the phrase `the shining' mean anything to you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This time they both shook their heads.
<div class="bookquote">``Doesn't matter, I guess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmonds/Bill '' -RRB- Edmonds/Bill Edmonds</b></font>)</div>Edmonds said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) opened the door into the waiting
room. <div class="bookquote">``Anybody here named Danny Torrance that would like to go home?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hi, Daddy! Hi, Mommy!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) stood up from the small table where he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) had been
leafing slowly through a copy of Where the Wild Things Are and muttering the
words he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) knew aloud.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) ran to Jack, who scooped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) up. Wendy ruffled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hair.
Edmonds peered at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If you don't love your mommy and daddy, you can stay
with good old Bill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said emphatically. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) slung one arm around Jack's neck, one
arm around Wendy's, and looked radiantly happy.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmonds/Bill '' -RRB- Edmonds/Bill Edmonds</b></font>)</div>Edmonds said, smiling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonds</b></font>) looked at Wendy. <div class="bookquote">``You call if you have any

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmonds/Bill '' -RRB- Edmonds/Bill Edmonds</b></font>)</div>Edmonds said, smiling.

THE SCRAPBOOK
Jack found the scrapbook on the first of November, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wife and son were
hiking up the rutted old road that ran from behind the roque court to a deserted
sawmill two miles further up. The fine weather still held, and all three of them
had acquired improbable autumn suntans.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had gone down in the basement to knock the press down on the boiler and
then, on impulse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had taken the flashlight from the shelf where the plumbing
schematics were and decided to look at some of the old papers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was also
looking for good places to set his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) traps, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) didn't plan to do that for
another month -- I want them all to be home from vacation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had told Wendy.
Shining the flashlight ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stepped past the elevator shaft -LRB-at
Wendy's insistence they hadn't used the elevator since they moved in-RRB- and
through the small stone arch. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) nose wrinkled at the smell of rotting paper.
Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) the boiler kicked on with a thundering whoosh, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) jump.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) flickered the light around, whistling tunelessly between his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) teeth. There
was a scale-model Andes range down here: dozens of boxes and crates stuffed with
papers, most of them white and shapeless with age and damp. Others had broken
open and spilled yellowed sheaves of paper onto the stone floor. There were
bales of newspaper tied up with hayrope. Some boxes contained what looked like
ledgers, and others contained invoices bound with rubber bands. Jack pulled one
out and put the flashlight beam on it.

Smiling, Jack let the paper drop back into the box.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) flashed the light above it and it speared a hanging lightbulb, almost
buried in cobwebs. There was no chain pull.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stood on tiptoe and tried screwing the bulb in. It lit weakly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) picked up
the toilet-paper invoice again and used it to wipe off some of the cobwebs. The
glow didn't brighten much.
Still using the flashlight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wandered through the boxes and bales of paper,
looking for rat spoor. They had been here, but not for quite a long time ...
maybe years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) found some droppings that were powdery with age, and several
nests of neatly shredded paper that were old and unused.
Jack pulled a newspaper from one of the bundles and glanced down at the
headline.
JOHNSON PROMISES ORDERLY TRANSITION
Says Work Begun by JFK Will Go Forward
in Coming Year
The paper was the Rocky Mountain News, dated December 19, 1963. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) dropped it
back onto its pile.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) was fascinated by that commonplace sense of history that anyone
can feel glancing through the fresh news of ten or twenty years ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) found
gaps in the piled newspapers and records; nothing from 1937 to 1945, from 1957
to 1960, from 1962 to 1963. Periods when the hotel had been closed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) guessed.
When it had been between suckers grabbing for the brass ring.
Ullman's explanations of the Overlook's checkered career still didn't ring
quite true to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>). It seemed that the Overlooks spectacular location alone
should have guaranteed its continuing success. There had always been an American
jetset, even before jets were invented, and it seemed to Jack that the Overlook
should have been one of the bases they touched in their migrations. It even
sounded right. The Waldorf in May, the Bar Harbor House in June and July, the
Overlook in August and early September, before moving on to Bermuda, Havana,
Rio, wherever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) found a pile of old desk registers and they bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) out.
Nelson Rockefeller in 1950. Henry Ford & Fam. in 1927. Jean Harlow in 1930.
Clark Gable and Carole Lombard. In 1956 the whole top floor had been taken for a
week by <div class="bookquote">``Darryl F. Zanuck & Party.''  (<font color='red'><b>Comstock</b></font>)</div>The money must have rolled down the
corridors and into the cash registers like a twentieth-century Comstock Lode.
The management must have been spectacularly bad.
There was history here, all right, and not just in newspaper headlines. It was
buried between the entries in these ledgers and account books and room-service
chits where you couldn't quite see it. In 1922 Warren G. Harding had ordered a

<p/>whole salmon at ten o'clock in the evening, and a case of Coors beer. But whom
had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) been eating and drinking with? Had it been a poker game? A strategy
session? What?
Jack glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) watch and was surprised to see that forty-five minutes had
somehow slipped by since he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had come down here. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands and arms were grimy,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) probably smelled bad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) decided to go up and take a shower before Wendy
and Danny got back.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) walked slowly between the mountains of paper, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind alive and ticking
over possibilities in a speedy way that was exhilarating. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hadn't felt this
way in years. It suddenly seemed that the book he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had semijokingly promised
himself might really happen. It might even be right here, buried in these untidy
heaps of paper. It could be a work of fiction, or history, or both -- a long book
exploding out of this central place in a hundred directions.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stood beneath the cobwebby light, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) handkerchief from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) back
pocket without thinking, and scrubbed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lips with it. And that was when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
saw the scrapbook.
A pile of five boxes stood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) left like some tottering Pisa. The one on
top was stuffed with more invoices and ledgers. Balanced on top of those,
keeping its angle of repose for who knew how many years, was a thick scrapbook
with white leather covers, its pages bound with two hanks of gold string that
bad been tied along the binding in gaudy bows.
Curious, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went over and took it down. The top cover was thick with dust. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
held it on a plane at lip level, blew the dust off in a cloud, and opened it. As
he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) did so a card fluttered out and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) grabbed it in mid-air before it could fall
to the stone floor. It was rich and creamy, dominated by a raised engraving of
the Overlook with every window alight. The lawn and playground were decorated
with glowing Japanese lanterns. It looked almost as though you could step right
into it, an Overlook Hotel that had existed thirty years ago.

their women. Tuxedos and glimmering starched shirts; evening gowns; the band

champagne corks. The war was over, or almost over. The future lay ahead, clean
and shining. America was the colossus of the world and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>colossus</b></font>) knew it and

POSH MOUNTAIN RESORT REOPENS WITH
STELLAR GUEST REGISTER
Derwent Says Overlook Will Be <div class="bookquote">``Showplace of the World''
 (<font color='red'><b>David</b></font>)</div>By David Felton, Features Editor
The Overlook Hotel has been opened and reopened in its thirty-eight-year
history, but rarely with such style and dash as that promised by Horace
Derwent, the mysterious California millionaire who is the latest owner of
the hostelry.
Derwent, who makes no secret of having sunk more than one million dollars
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) newest venture -- and some say the figure is closer to three
million -- says that <div class="bookquote">``The new Overlook will be one of the world's showplaces,
the kind of hotel you will remember overnighting in thirty years later.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Derwent/Horace Derwent</b></font>)</div>When Derwent, who is rumored to have substantial Las Vegas holdings, was
asked if his (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) purchase and refurbishing of the Overlook signaled the opening
gun in a battle to legalize casino-style gambling in Colorado, the
aircraft, movie, munitions, and shipping magnate denied it ... with a
smile. <div class="bookquote">``The Overlook would be cheapened by gambling,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>magnate</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and don't
think I'm knocking Vegas! They've got too many of my markers out there for
me to do that! I have no interest in lobbying for legalized gambling in
Colorado. It would be spitting into the wind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When the Overlook opens officially -LRB-there was a gigantic and hugely
successful party there some time ago when the actual work was finished-RRB-,
the newly painted, papered, and decorated rooms will be occupied by a
stellar guest list, ranging from Chic designer Corbat Stani to...

<p/>Smiling bemusedly, Jack turned the page. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was looking at a full-page ad
from the New York Sunday Times travel section. On the page after that a story on
Derwent himself, a balding man with eyes that pierced you even from an old
newsprint photo. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was wearing rimless spectacles and a forties-style pencilline mustache that did nothing at all to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look like Errol Flynn. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
face was that of an accountant. It was the eyes that made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look like someone
or something else.
Jack skimmed the article rapidly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knew most of the information from a
Newsweek story on Derwent the year before. Born poor in St. Paul, never finished
high school, joined the Navy instead. Rose rapidly, then left in a bitter
wrangle over the patent on a new type of propeller that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) had designed. In the
tug of war between the Navy and an unknown young man named Horace Derwent, Uncle
Sam came off the predictable winner. But Uncle Sam had never gotten another
patent, and there had been a lot of them.
In the late twenties and early thirties, Derwent turned to aviation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) bought
out a bankrupt cropdusting company, turned it into an airmail service, and
prospered. More patents followed: a new monoplane wing design, a bomb carriage

<p/>used on the Flying Fortresses that had rained fire on Hamburg and Dresden and
Berlin, a machine gun that was cooled by alcohol, a prototype of the ejection
seat later used in United States jets.
And along the line, the accountant who lived in the same skin as the inventor
kept piling up the investments. A piddling string of munition factories in New
York and New Jersey. Five textile mills in New England. Chemical factories in
the bankrupt and groaning South. At the end of the Depression his (<font color='blue'><b>inventor</b></font>) wealth had
been nothing but a handful of controlling interests, bought at abysmally low
prices, salable only at lower prices still. At one point Derwent boasted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>)
could liquidate completely and realize the price of a three-year-old Chevrolet.
There had been rumors, Jack recalled, that some of the means employed by
Derwent to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head above water were less than savory. Involvement with
bootlegging. Prostitution in the Midwest. Smuggling in the coastal areas of the
South where his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fertilizer factories were. Finally an association with the
nascent western gambling interests.
Probably Derwent's most famous investment was the purchase of the foundering
Top Mark Studios, which had not had a hit since their child star, Little Margery
Morris, had died of a heroin overdose in 1934. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) was fourteen. Little Margery,
who had specialized in sweet seven-year-olds who saved marriages and the lives
of dogs unjustly accused of killing chickens, had been given the biggest
Hollywood funeral in history by Top Mark -- the official story was that Little
Margery had contracted a <div class="bookquote">``wasting disease''  (<font color='red'><b>Margery</b></font>)</div>while entertaining at a New York
orphanage -- and some cynics suggested the studio had laid out all that long green
because it knew it was burying itself.
Derwent hired a keen businessman and raging sex maniac named Henry Finkel to
run Top Mark, and in the two years before Pearl Harbor the studio ground out
sixty movies, fifty-five of which glided right into the face of the Hayes Office
and spit on its large blue nose. The other five were government training films.
The feature films were huge successes. During one of them an unnamed costume
designer had juryrigged a strapless bra for the heroine to appear in during the
Grand Ball scene, where she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) revealed everything except possibly the birthmark
just below the cleft of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) buttocks. Derwent received credit for this invention
as well, and his (<font color='blue'><b>designer</b></font>) reputation -- or notoriety -- grew.
The war had made him (<font color='blue'><b>designer</b></font>) rich and he (<font color='blue'><b>designer</b></font>) was still rich. Living in Chicago, seldom
seen except for Derwent Enterprises board meetings -LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>designer</b></font>) ran with an iron
hand-RRB-, it was rumored that he (<font color='blue'><b>designer</b></font>) owned United Air Lines, Las Vegas -LRB-where he (<font color='blue'><b>designer</b></font>) was
known to have controlling interests in four hotel-casinos and some involvement
in at least six others-RRB-, Los Angeles, and the U.S.A. itself. Reputed to be a
friend of royalty, presidents, and underworld kingpins, it was supposed by many
that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was the richest man in the world.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had not been able to make a go of the Overlook, Jack thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) put
the scrapbook down for a moment and took the small notebook and mechanical
pencil he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) always kept with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) breast pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) jotted <div class="bookquote">``Look into H.
Derwent, Sidwndr lbry?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) put the notebook back and picked up the scrapbook
again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face was preoccupied, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes distant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mouth constantly
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) turned the pages.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) skimmed the material that followed, making a mental note to read it more
closely later. Press releases were pasted into many of the pages. So-and-so was

<p/>expected at the Overlook next week, thus-and-such would be entertaining in the
lounge -LRB-in Derwent's time it had been the Red-Eye Lounge-RRB-. Many of the
entertainers were Vegas names, and many of the guests were Top Mark executives
and stars.
Then, in a clipping marked February 1, 1952:
MILLIONAIRE EXEC TO SELL COLORADO
INVESTMENTS
Deal Made with California Investors on
Overlook, Other Investments, Derwent Reveals
By Rodney Conklin, Financial Editor
In a terse communique yesterday from the Chicago offices of the monolithic
Derwent Enterprises, it was revealed that millionaire -LRB-perhaps billionaire-RRB-
Horace Derwent has sold out of Colorado in a stunning financial power play
that will be completed by October 1, 1954. Derwent's investments include
natural gas, coal, hydroelectric power, and a land development company
called Colorado Sunshine, Inc., which owns or holds options on better than
500,000 acres of Colorado land.
The most famous Derwent holding in Colorado, the Overlook Hotel, has
already been sold, Derwent revealed in a rare interview yesterday. The
buyer was a California group of investors headed by Charles Grondin, a
former director of the California Land Development Corporation. While
Derwent refused to discuss price, informed sources ...

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) had sold out everything, lock, stock, and barrel. It wasn't just the
Overlook. But somehow.. . somehow...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) lips with his (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) hand and wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) had a drink. This would go
better with a drink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) turned more pages.
The California group had opened the hotel for two seasons, and then sold it to
a Colorado group called Mountainview Resorts. Mountainview went bankrupt in 1957
amid charges of corruption, nest-feathering, and cheating the stockholders. The
president of the company shot himself two days after being subpoenaed to appear
before a grand jury.
The hotel had been closed for the rest of the decade. There was a single story
about it, a Sunday feature headlined FORMER GRAND HOTEL SINKING INTO DECAY. The
accompanying photos wrenched at Jack's heart: the paint on the front porch
peeling, the lawn a bald and scabrous mess, windows broken by storms and stones.
This would be a part of the book, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) actually wrote it, too -- the phoenix going
down into the ashes to be reborn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) promised himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would take care of the
place, very good care. It seemed that before today he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had never really
understood the breadth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) responsibility to the Overlook. It was almost like
having a responsibility to history.
In 1961 four writers, two of them Pulitzer Prize winners, had leased the
Overlook and reopened it as a writers' school. That had lasted one year. One of
the students had gotten drunk in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) third-floor room, crashed out of the window
somehow, and fell to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) death on the cement terrace below. The paper hinted
that it might have been suicide.
Any big hotel have got scandals, Watson had said, just like every big hotel
has got a ghost. Why? Hell, people come and go...

<p/>Suddenly it seemed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) could almost feel the weight of the Overlook
bearing down on him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) from above, one hundred and ten guest rooms, the storage
rooms, kitchen, pantry, freezer, lounge, ballroom, dining room ...
-LRB-In the room the women come and go-RRB-
-LRB-... and the Red Death held sway over all.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) lips and turned to the next page in the scrapbook. He (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) was in the
last third of it now, and for the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) wondered consciously whose book
this was, left atop the highest pile of records in the cellar.
A new headline, this one dated April 10, 1963.
LAS VEGAS GROUP BUYS FAMED COLORADO HOTEL
Scenic Overlook to Become Key Club
Robert T. Leffing, spokesman for a group of investors going under the name
of High Country Investments, announced today in Las Vegas that High
Country has negotiated a deal for the famous Overlook Hotel, a resort
located high in the Rockies. Leffing declined to mention the names of
specific investors, but said the hotel would be turned into an exclusive
<div class="bookquote">``key club.''  (<font color='red'><b>investors</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>T.</b></font>) said that the group he (<font color='blue'><b>T.</b></font>) represents hopes to sell memberships
to high echelon executives in American and foreign companies.
High Country also owns hotels in Montana, Wyoming, and Utah.
The Overlook became world-known in the years 1946 to 1952 when it was
owned by elusive mega-millionaire Horace Derwent, who ...

<p/>The item on the next page was a mere squib, dated four months later. The
Overlook had opened under its new management. Apparently the paper hadn't been
able to find out or wasn't interested in who the key holders were, because no
name was mentioned but High Country Investments -- the most anonymous-sounding
company name Jack had ever heard except for a chain of bike and appliance shops
in western New England that went under the name of Business, Inc..
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) turned the page and blinked down at the clipping pasted there.
MILLIONAIRE DERWENT BACK IN COLORADO VIA BACK DOOR?
High Country Exec Revealed to be
Charles Grondin
By Rodney Conklin, Financial Editor
The Overlook Hotel, a scenic pleasure palace in the Colorado high country
and once the private plaything of millionaire Horace Derwent, is at the
center of a financial tangle which is only now beginning to come to light.
On April 10 of last year the hotel was purchased by a Las Vegas firm,
High Country Investments, as a key club for wealthy executives of both
foreign and domestic breeds. Now informed sources say that High Country is
headed by Charles Grondin, 53, who was the head of California Land
Development Corp. until 1959, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grondin</b></font>) resigned to take the position of
executive veep in the Chicago home office of Derwent Enterprises.
This has led to speculation that High Country Investments may be
controlled by Derwent, who may have acquired the Overlook for the second
time, and under decidedly peculiar circumstances.
Grondin, who was indicted and acquitted on charges of tax evasion in
1960, could not be reached for comment, and Horace Derwent, who guards his (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>)
own privacy jealously, had no comment when reached by telephone. State

<p/>Representative Dick Bows of Golden has called for a complete investigation
into ...

<p/>That clipping was dated July 27, 1964. The next was a column from a Sunday
paper that September. The byline belonged to Josh Brannigar, a muck-raking
investigator of the Jack Anderson breed. Jack vaguely recalled that Brannigar
had died in 1968 or '69.
MAFIA FREE-ZONE IN COLORADO?
By Josh Brannigar
It now seems possible that the newest r&r spot of Organization overlords in
the U.S. is located at an out-of-the-way hotel nestled in the center of the
Rockies. The Overlook Hotel, a white elephant that has been run lucklessly
by almost a dozen different groups and individuals since it first opened
its doors in 1910, is now being operated as a security-jacketed <div class="bookquote">``key club,''
 (<font color='red'><b>individuals</b></font>)</div>ostensibly for unwinding businessmen. The question is, what business are
the Overlook's key holders really in?
The members present during the week of August 16-23 may give us an idea.
The list below was obtained by a former employee of High Country
Investments, a company first believed to be a dummy company owned by
Derwent Enterprises. It now seems more likely that Derwent's interest in
High Country -LRB-if any-RRB- is outweighed by those of several Las Vegas gambling
barons. And these same gaming honchos have been linked in the past to both
suspected and convicted underworld kingpins.
Present at the Overlook during that sunny week in August were:
Charles Grondin, President of High Country Investments. When it became
known in July of this year that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grondin</b></font>) was running the High Country ship it was
announced -- considerably after the fact -- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grondin</b></font>) had resigned his (<font color='blue'><b>Grondin</b></font>) position in
Derwent Enterprises previously. The silver-maned Grondin, who refused to
talk to me for this column, has been tried once and acquitted on tax
evasion charges -LRB-1960-RRB- .
Charles <div class="bookquote">``Baby Charlie''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>Battaglia, a 60-year-old Vegas empressario
-LRB-controlling interests in The Greenback and The Lucky Bones on the Strip-RRB-.
Battaglia is a close personal friend of Grondin. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grondin</b></font>) arrest record
stretches back to 1932, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grondin</b></font>) was tried and acquitted in the
gangland-style murder of Jack <div class="bookquote">``Dutchy''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Morgan. Federal authorities suspect
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) involvement in the drug traffic, prostitution, and murder for hire, but
<div class="bookquote">``Baby Charlie''  (<font color='red'><b>Federal authorities</b></font>)</div>has only been behind bars once, for income tax evasion in
1955-56.
Richard Scarne, the principal stockholder of Fun Time Automatic Machines.
Fun Time makes slot machines for the Nevada crowd, pinball machines, and
jukeboxes -LRB-Melody-Coin-RRB- for the rest of the country. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) has done time for
assault with a deadly weapon -LRB-1940-RRB-, carrying a concealed weapon -LRB-1948-RRB-,
and conspiracy to commit tax fraud -LRB-1961-RRB- .
Peter Zeiss, a Miami-based importer, now nearing 70. For the last five
years Zeiss has been fighting deportation as an undesirable person. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) has
been convicted on charges of receiving and concealing stolen property
-LRB-1958-RRB-, and conspiracy to commit tax fraud -LRB-1954-RRB-. Charming, distinguished,
and courtly, Pete Zeiss is called <div class="bookquote">``Poppa''  (<font color='red'><b>Pete</b></font>)</div>by his (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) intimates and has been
tried on charges of murder and accessory to murder. A large stockholder in
Scarne's Fun Time company, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) also has known interests in four Las Vegas
casinos.
Vittorio Gienelli, also known as <div class="bookquote">``Vito the Chopper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gienelli/Vittorio Gienelli</b></font>)</div>tried twice for
gangland-style murders, one of them the ax-murder of Boston vice overlord

<p/>Frank Scoffy. Gienelli has been indicted twenty-three times, tried fourteen
times, and convicted only once, for shoplifting in 1940. It has been said
that in recent years Gienelli has become a power in the organization's
western operation, which is centered in Las Vegas.
Carl <div class="bookquote">``Jimmy-Ricks''  (<font color='red'><b>Carl</b></font>)</div>Prashkin, a San Francisco investor, reputed to be the
heir apparent of the power Gienelli now wields. Prashkin owns large blocks
of stock in Derwent Enterprises, High Country Investments, Fun Time
Automatic Machines, and three Vegas casinos. Prashkin is clean in America,
but was indicted in Mexico on fraud charges that were dropped quickly three
weeks after they were brought. It has been suggested that Prashkin may be
in charge of laundering money skimmed from Vegas casino operations and
funneling the big bucks back into the organization's legitimate western
operations. And such operations may now include the Overlook Hotel in
Colorado.
Other visitors during the current season include...

<p/>There was more but Jack only skimmed it, constantly wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) lips with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
hand. A banker with Las Vegas connections. Men from New York who were apparently
doing more in the Garment District than making clothes. Men reputed to be
involved with drugs, vice, robbery, murder.
God, what a story! And they had all been here, right above him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), in those empty
rooms. Screwing expensive whores on the third floor, maybe. Drinking magnums of
champagne. Making deals that would turn over millions of dollars, maybe in the
very suite of rooms where Presidents had stayed. There was a story, all right.
One hell of a story. A little frantically, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) notebook and jotted
down another memo to check all of these people out at the library in Denver when
the caretaking job was over. Every hotel has its ghost? The Overlook had a whole
coven of them. First suicide, then the Mafia, what next?
The next clipping was an angry denial of Brannigar's charges by Charles
Grondin. Jack smirked at it.
The clipping on the next page was so large that it had been folded. Jack
unfolded it and gasped harshly. The picture there seemed to leap out at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>): the
wallpaper had been changed since June of 1966, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knew that window and the
view perfectly well. It was the western exposure of the Presidential Suite.
Murder came next. The sitting room wall by the door leading into the bedroom was
splashed with blood and what could only be white flecks of brain matter. A
blank-faced cop was standing over a corpse hidden by a blanket. Jack stared,
fascinated, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes moved up to the headline.
GANGLAND-STYLE SHOOTING AT
COLORADO HOTEL
Reputed Crime Overlord Shot at Mountain Key Club
Two Others Dead
SIDEWINDER, COLO -LRB-UPI-RRB--Forty miles from this sleepy Colorado town, a
gangland-style execution has occurred in the heart of the Rocky Mountains.
The Overlook Hotel, purchased three years ago as an exclusive key club by a
Las Vegas firm, was the site of a triple shotgun slaying. Two of the men
were either the companions or bodyguards of Vittorio Gienelli, also known
as <div class="bookquote">``The Chopper''  (<font color='red'><b>Gienelli/Vittorio Gienelli</b></font>)</div>for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gienelli</b></font>) reputed involvement in a Boston slaying twenty
years ago.
Police were summoned by Robert Norman, manager of the Overlook, who said

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) heard shots and that some of the guests reported two men wearing
stockings on their faces and carrying guns had fled down the fire escape
and driven off in a late-model tan convertible.
State Trooper Benjamin Moorer discovered two dead men, later identified
as Victor T. Boorman and Roger Macassi, both of Las Vegas, outside the door
of the Presidential Suite where two American Presidents have stayed.
Inside, Moorer found the body of Gienelli sprawled on the floor. Gienelli
was apparently fleeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gienelli</b></font>) attackers when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gienelli</b></font>) was cut down. Moorer said
Gienelli had been shot with heavy-gauge shotguns at close range.
Charles Grondin, the representative of the company which now owns the
Overlook, could not be reached for...

<p/>Below the clipping, in heavy strokes of a ball-point pen, someone had written:
They took his (<font color='blue'><b>Grondin</b></font>) balls along with them. Jack stared at that for a long time,
feeling cold. Whose book was this?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) turned the page at last, swallowing a click in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) throat. Another column
from Josh Brannigar, this one dated early 1967. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) only read the headline:
NOTORIOUS HOTEL SOLD FOLLOWING MURDER OF UNDERWORLD FIGURE.
The sheets following that clipping were blank.
-LRB-They took his (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) balls along with them.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) flipped back to the beginning, looking for a name or address. Even a room
number. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) felt quite sure that whoever had kept this little book of
memories had stayed at the hotel. But there was nothing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) was getting ready to go through all the clippings, more closely this time,
when a voice called down the stairs: <div class="bookquote">``Jack? Hon?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Wendy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) started, almost guiltily, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) had been drinking secretly and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would
smell the fumes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>). Ridiculous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) scrubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) lips with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) hand and
called back, <div class="bookquote">``Yeah, babe. Lookin for rats.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was coming down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) on the stairs, then crossing the boiler
room. Quickly, without thinking why he (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) might be doing it, be stuffed the
scrapbook under a pile of bills and invoices. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) stood up as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) came through
the arch.
<div class="bookquote">``What in the world have you been doing down here? It's almost three o'clock!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Is it that late? I got rooting around through all this stuff.
Trying to find out where the bodies are buried, I guess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The words clanged back viciously in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) mind.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) came closer, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) unconsciously retreated a step, unable
to help himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was doing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was trying to smell liquor on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>). Probably she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wasn't even aware of it herself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) was, and it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>)
feel both guilty and angry.
<div class="bookquote">``Your mouth is bleeding,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said in a curiously flat tone.
<div class="bookquote">``Huh?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) lips and winced at the thin stinging. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) index
finger came away bloody. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) guilt increased.
<div class="bookquote">``You've been rubbing your mouth again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) looked down and shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I guess I have.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's been hell for you, hasn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, not so bad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Has it gotten any easier?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) feet start moving. Once they were actually in
motion it was easier. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) crossed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) wife and slipped an arm around her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
waist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) brushed aside a sheaf of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) blond hair and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) neck. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``Where's Danny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s around somewhere. It's started to cloud up outside. Hungry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) slipped a hand over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) taut, jeans-clad bottom with counterfeit lechery.
<div class="bookquote">``Like ze bear, madame.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Watch out, slugger. Don't start something you can't finish.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fig-fig, madame?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) asked, still rubbing. <div class="bookquote">``Dirty peeotures? Unnatural
positions?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As they went through the arch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) threw one glance back at the box
where the scrapbook
-LRB-whose?-RRB-
was hidden. With the light out it was only a shadow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) was relieved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>)
had gotten Wendy away. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>) lust became less acted, more natural, as they
approached the stairs.
<div class="bookquote">``Maybe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``After we get you a sandwich-yeek!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) twisted away from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brannigar</b></font>), giggling. <div class="bookquote">``That tickles!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It teekles nozzing like Jock Torrance would like to teekle you, madame.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lay off, Jock. How about a ham and cheese ... for the first course?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>They went up the stairs together, and Jack didn't look over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shoulder
again. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) thought of Watson's words:
Every big hotel has got a ghost. Why? Hell, people come and go...
Then Wendy shut the basement door behind them, closing it into darkness.

<p/><< 19 >>
OUTSIDE 217
Danny was remembering the words of someone else who had worked at the Overlook
during the season:
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)'d seen something in one of the rooms where ... a bad thing
happened. That was in Room 217 and I want you to promise me you won't go in
there, Danny ... steer right clear ...
It was a perfectly ordinary door, no different from any other door on the
first two floors of the hotel. It was dark gray, halfway down a corridor that
ran at right angles to the main second-floor hallway. The numbers on the door
looked no different from the house numbers on the Boulder apartment building
they had lived in. A 2, a 1, and a 7. Big deal. Just below them was a tiny glass
circle, a peephole. Danny had tried several of them. From the inside you got a
wide, fish-eye view of the corridor. From outside you could screw up your eye
seven ways to Sunday and still not see a thing. A dirty gyp:
-LRB-Why are you here?-RRB-

<p/>After the walk behind the Overlook, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and Mommy had come back and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mommy</b></font>) had
fixed him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) favorite lunch, a cheese and bologna sandwich plus Campbell's Bean
Soup. They ate in Dick's kitchen and talked. The radio was on, getting thin and
crackly music from the Estes Park station. The kitchen was his (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>) favorite place in
the hotel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>) guessed that Mommy and Daddy must feel the same way, because
after trying their meals in the dining room for three days or so, they had begun
eating in the kitchen by mutual consent, setting up chairs around Dick
Hallorann's butcher block, which was almost as big as their dining room table
back in Stovington, anyway. The dining room had been too depressing, even with
the lights on and the music playing from the tape cassette system in the office.
You were still just one of three people sitting at a table surrounded by dozens
of other tables, all empty, all covered with those transparent plastic
dustcloths. Mommy said it was like having dinner in the middle of a Horace
Walpole novel, and Daddy had laughed and agreed. Danny had no idea who Horace
Walpole was, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) did know that Mommy's cooking had begun to taste better as
soon as they began to eat it in the kitchen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) kept discovering little flashes
of Dick Hallorann's personality lying around, and they reassured him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) like a warm
touch.
Mommy had eaten half a sandwich, no soup. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said Daddy must have gone out
for a walk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) own since both the VW and the hotel truck were in the parking
lot. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was tired and might lie down for an hour or so, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) could amuse himself and not get into trouble. Danny told her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) around a

<div class="bookquote">``Why don't you go out into the playground?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I thought you'd
love that place, with a sandbox for your trucks and all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) swallowed and the food went down his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) throat in a lump that was dry and
hard. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said, turning to the radio and fiddling with it.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) guilelessly, a milk mustache on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lip. <div class="bookquote">``Uh-huh.''

his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) name faintly and from far away. Danny had squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes tightly shut
until Tony had gone.
<div class="bookquote">``You sure?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) seemed satisfied. <div class="bookquote">``How's your hand?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) flexed it for her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``All better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) nodded. Jack had taken the nest under the Pyrex bowl, full of frozen
wasps, out to the incinerator in back of the equipment shed and burned it. They
had seen no more wasps since. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had written to a lawyer in Boulder, enclosing

<p/>the snaps of Danny's hand, and the lawyer had called back two days ago -- that had
put Jack in a foul temper all afternoon. The lawyer doubted if the company that
had manufactured the bug bomb could be sued successfully because there was only
Jack to testify that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had followed directions printed on the package. Jack had
asked the lawyer if they couldn't purchase some others and test them for the
same defect. Yes, the lawyer said, but the results were highly doubtful even if
all the test bombs malfunctioned. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) told Jack of a case that involved an
extension ladder company and a man who had broken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back. Wendy had
commiserated with Jack, but privately she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had just been glad that Danny had
gotten off as cheaply as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had. It was best to leave lawsuits to people who
understood them, and that did not include the Torrances. And they had seen no
more wasps since.
<div class="bookquote">``Go and play, doc. Have fun.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hadn't had fun. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had wandered aimlessly around the hotel, poking into
the maids' closets and the janitor's rooms, looking for something interesting,
not finding it, a small boy padding along a dark blue carpet woven with twisting
black lines. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had tried a room door from time to time, but of course they were
all locked. The passkey was hanging down in the office, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew where, but Daddy
had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) shouldn't touch that. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) didn't want to. Did be?
-LRB-Why are you here?-RRB-
There was nothing aimless about it after all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) had been drawn to Room 217 by
a morbid kind of curiosity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) remembered a story Daddy had read to him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) once
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) was drunk. That had been a long time ago, but the story was just as
vivid now as when Daddy had read it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>). Mommy had scolded Daddy and asked
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) was doing, reading a three-year-old baby something so horrible. The name
of the story was Bluebeard. That was clear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) mind too, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) had
thought at first Daddy was saying Bluebird, and there were no bluebirds in the
story, or birds of any kind for that matter. Actually the story was about
Bluebeard's wife, a pretty lady that had corn-colored hair like Mommy. After
Bluebeard married her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), they lived in a big and ominous castle that was not
unlike the Overlook. And every day Bluebeard went off to work and every day he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>)
would tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) pretty little wife not to look in a certain room, although the
key to that room was hanging right on a hook, just like the passkey was hanging
on the office wall downstairs. Bluebeard's wife had gotten more and more curious
about the locked room. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tried to peep through the keyhole the way Danny had
tried to look through Room 217's peephole with similar unsatisfying results.
There was even a picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) getting down on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knees and trying to look
under the door, but the crack wasn't wide enough. The door swung wide and ...
The old fairy tale book had depicted her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) discovery in ghastly, loving detail.
The image was burned on Danny's mind. The severed heads of Bluebeard's seven
previous wives were in the room, each one on its own pedestal, the eyes turned
up to whites, the mouths unhinged and gaping in silent screams. They were
somehow balanced on necks ragged from the broadsword's decapitating swing, and
there was blood running down the pedestals.
Terrified, she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had turned to flee from the room and the castle, only to
discover Bluebeard standing in the doorway, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) terrible eyes blazing. <div class="bookquote">``I told
you not to enter this room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bluebeard</b></font>)</div>Bluebeard said, unsheathing his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sword. <div class="bookquote">``Alas, in
your curiosity you are like the other seven, and though I loved you best of all

<p/>your ending shall be as was theirs. Prepare to die, wretched woman!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It seemed vaguely to Danny that the story had bad a happy ending, but that had
paled to insignificance beside the two dominant images: the taunting, maddening
locked door with some great secret behind it, and the grisly secret itself,
repeated more than half a dozen times. The locked door and behind it the heads,
the severed beads.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand reached out and stroked the room's doorknob, almost furtively. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had
no idea how long be had been here, standing hypnotized before the bland gray
locked door.
-LRB-And maybe three times I've thought I've seen things ... nasty things ...-RRB-
But Mr. Hallorann -- Dick -- had also said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) didn't think those things could hurt
you. They were like scary pictures in a book, that was all. And maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>)
wouldn't see anything. On the other hand ...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) plunged his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) left hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) pocket and it came out holding the passkey.
It had been there all along, of course.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) held it by the square metal tab on the end which had OFFICE printed on it
in Magic Marker. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) twirled the key on its chain, watching it go around and
around. After several minutes of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) stopped and slipped the passkey into
the lock. It slid in smoothly, with no hitch, as if it had wanted to be there
all along.
-LRB-I've thought I've seen things ... nasty things ... promise me you won't
go in there.-RRB-
-LRB-I promise.-RRB-
And a promise was, of course, very important. Still, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) curiosity itched at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) as maddeningly as poison ivy in a place you aren't supposed to scratch. But
it was a dreadful kind of curiosity, the kind that makes you peek through your
fingers during the scariest parts of a scary movie. What was beyond that door
would be no movie.
-LRB-I don't think those things can hurt you ... like scary pictures in a book ...-RRB-
Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) reached out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) left hand, not sure of what it was going to
do until it had removed the passkey and stuffed it back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>)
stared at the door a moment longer, blue-gray eyes wide, then turned quickly and
walked back down the corridor toward the main hallway that ran at right angles
to the corridor he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) was in.
Something made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) pause there and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) wasn't sure what for a moment. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>)
remembered that directly around this corner, on the way back to the stairs,
there was one of those old-fashioned fire extinguishers curled up against the
wall. Curled there like a dozing snake.
They weren't chemical-type extinguishers at all, Daddy said, although there
were several of those in the kitchen. These were the forerunner of the modern
sprinkler systems. The long canvas hoses hooked directly into the Overlook's
plumbing system, and by turning a single valve you could become a one-man fire
department. Daddy said that the chemical extinguishers, which sprayed foam or
CO, were much better. The chemicals smothered fires, took away the oxygen they
needed to burn, while a high-pressure spray might just spread the flames around.
Daddy said that Mr. Ullman should replace the old-fashioned hoses right along
with the old-fashioned boiler, but Mr. Ullman would probably do neither because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) was a CHEAP PRICK. Danny knew that this was one of the worst epithets his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)

<p/>father could summon. It was applied to certain doctors, dentists, and appliance
repairmen, and also to the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) English Department at Stovington, who had
disallowed some of Daddy's book orders because he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said the books would put them
over budget. <div class="bookquote">``Over budget, hell,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had fumed to Wendy -- Danny had been listening
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bedroom where he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was supposed to be asleep. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'s just saving the last
five hundred bucks for himself, the CHEAP PRICK.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny looked around the corner.
The extinguisher was there, a fiat hose folded back a dozen times on itself,
the red tank attached to the wall. Above it was an ax in a glass case like a
museum exhibit, with white words printed on a red background: IN CASE OF
EMERGENCY, BREAK GLASS. Danny could read the word EMERGENCY, which was also the
name of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) favorite TV shows, but was unsure of the rest. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't
like the way the word was used in connection with that long fiat hose. EMERGENCY
was', fire, explosions, car crashes, hospitals, sometimes death. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't
like the way that hose hung so blandly on the wall. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) always
skittered past these extinguishers as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could. No particular reason. It
just felt better to go fast. It felt safer.
Now, heart thumping loudly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) chest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) came around the corner and looked
down the hall past the extinguisher to the stairs. Mommy was down there,
sleeping. And if Daddy was back from his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) walk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) would probably be sitting in
the kitchen, eating a sandwich and reading a book. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) would just walk right past
that old extinguisher and go downstairs.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) started toward it, moving closer to the far wall until his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) right arm was
brushing the expensive silk paper. Twenty steps away. Fifteen. A dozen.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) was ten steps away, the brass nozzle suddenly rolled off the fat loop
it had been lying
-LRB-sleeping?-RRB-
on and fell to the hall carpet with a dull thump. It lay there, the dark bore
of its muzzle pointing at Danny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stopped immediately, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shoulders twitching
forward with the suddenness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) scare. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) blood thumped thickly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ears
and temples. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth had gone dry and sour, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands curled into fists. Yet
the nozzle of the hose only lay there, its brass casing glowing mellowly, a loop
of flat canvas leading back up to the red-painted frame bolted to the wall.
So it had fallen off, so what? It was only a fire extinguisher, nothing else.
It was stupid to think that it looked like some poison snake from <div class="bookquote">``Wide World of
Animals''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>that had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and woken up. Even if the stitched canvas did look a
little bit like scales. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would just step over it and go down the hall to the
stairs, walking a little bit fast, maybe, to make sure it didn't snap out after
him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and curl around his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) foot...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lips with his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) left hand, in unconscious imitation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father,
and took a step forward. No movement from the hose. Another step. Nothing.
There, see how stupid you are? You got all worked up thinking about that dumb
room and that dumb Bluebeard story and that hose was probably ready to fall off
for the last five years. That's all.
Danny stared at the hose on the floor and thought of wasps.
Eight steps away, the nozzle of the hose gleamed peacefully at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) from the
rug as if to say: Don't worry. I'm just a hose, that's all. And even if that
isn't all, what I do to you won't be much worse than a bee sting. Or a wasp

<p/>sting. What would I want to do to a nice little boy like you ... except bite...
and bite ... and bite?
Danny took another step, and another. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) breath was dry and harsh in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
throat. Panic was close now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) began to wish the hose would move, then at last
he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would be sure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) took another step and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was within
striking distance. But it's not going to strike at you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thought hysterically.
How can it strike at you, bite at you, when it's just a hose?
Maybe it's full of wasps.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) internal temperature plummeted to ten below zero. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stared at the black
bore in the center of the nozzle, nearly hypnotized. Maybe it was full of wasps,
secret wasps, their brown bodies bloated with poison, so full of autumn poison
that it dripped from their stingers in clear drops of fluid.
Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was nearly frozen with terror; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) did not make his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
feet go now, they would become locked to the carpet and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would stay here,
staring at the black hole in the center of the brass nozzle like a bird staring
at a snake, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would stay here until his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy found him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and then what would
happen?
With a high moan, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) made himself run. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) reached the hose, some trick of
the light made the nozzle seem to move, to revolve as if to strike, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
leaped high in the air above it; in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) panicky state it seemed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) legs
pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) nearly all the way to the ceiling, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could feel the stiff back
hairs that formed his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) cowlick brushing the hallway's plaster ceiling, although
later he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knew that couldn't have been so.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) came down on the other side of the hose and ran, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) heard it
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), coming for him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), the soft dry whicker of that brass snake's head as
it slithered rapidly along the carpet after him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) like a rattlesnake moving
swiftly through a dry field of grass. It was coming for him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), and suddenly the
stairs seemed very far away; they seemed to retreat a running step into the
distance for each running step he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) took toward them.
Daddy! he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tried to scream, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) closed throat would not allow a word to
pass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) own. Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) the sound grew louder, the dry sliding sound
of the snake, slipping swiftly over the carpet's dry hackles. At his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) heels now,
perhaps rising up with the clear poison dribbling from its brass snout.
Danny reached the stairs and had to pinwheel his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) arms crazily for balance. For
one moment it seemed sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would cartwheel over and go head-for-heels to
the bottom.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) threw a glance back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shoulder.
The hose had not moved. It lay as it had lain, one loop off the frame, the
brass nozzle on the hall floor, the nozzle pointing disinterestedly away from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). You see, stupid? he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) berated himself. You made it all up, scaredy-cat. It
was all your imagination, scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) clung to the stairway railing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) legs trembling in reaction.
-LRB-It never chased you-RRB-
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind told him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), and seized on that thought, and played it back.
-LRB-never chased you, never chased you, never did, never did-RRB-
It was nothing to be afraid of. Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could go back and put that hose right
into its frame, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wanted to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would. Because
what if it had chased him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and had gone back when it saw that it couldn't ...

<p/>quite ... catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)?
The hose lay on the carpet, almost seeming to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would like to come
back and try again.
Panting, Danny ran downstairs.

TALKING TO MR. ULLMAN
The Sidewinder Public Library was a small, retiring building one block down
from the town's business area. It was a modest, vine-covered building, and the
wide concrete walk up to the door was lined with the corpses of last summer's
flowers. On the lawn was a large bronze statue of a Civil War general Jack had
never heard of, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been something of a Civil War buff in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
teenage years.
The newspaper files were kept downstairs. They consisted of the Sidewinder
Gazette that had gone bust in 1963, the Estes Park daily, and the Boulder
Camera. No Denver papers at all.
Sighing, Jack settled for the Camera.
When the files reached 1965, the actual newspapers were replaced by spools of
microfilm -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``A federal grant,''  (<font color='red'><b>the librarian</b></font>)</div>the librarian told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) brightly. <div class="bookquote">``We hope to do
1958 to '64 when the next check comes through, but they're so slow, aren't they?
You will be careful, won't you? I just know you will. Call if you need me.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-.
The only reading machine had a lens that had somehow gotten warped, and by the
time Wendy put her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shoulder some forty-five minutes after he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had
switched from the actual papers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had a juicy thumper of a headache.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny's in the park,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) outside too long. How
much longer do you think you'll be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ten minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said. Actually he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had traced down the last of the Overlook's
fascinating history ¯ the years between the gangland shooting and the takeover by
Stuart Ullman & Co.. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) felt the same reticence about telling Wendy.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you up to, anyway?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ruffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) hair as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said it,
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) voice was only half-teasing.
<div class="bookquote">``Looking up some old Overlook history,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Any particular reason?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) said, having to strive to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) voice pleasant now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was
prying, just the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had always pried and poked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) when they had been at
Stovington and Danny was still a crib-infant. Where are you going, Jack? When

<p/>will you be back? How much money do you have with you? Are you going to take the
car? Is Al going to be with you? Will one of you stay sober? On and on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had,
pardon the expression, driven him (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) to drink. Maybe that hadn't been the only
reason, but by Christ let's tell the truth here and admit it was one of them.
Nag and nag and nag until you wanted to clout her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) one just to shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) up and
stop the

endless flow of questions. It could give you a real
-LRB-headache? hangover?-RRB-
headache. The reader. The damned reader with its distorted print. That was why
he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had such a cunt of a headache.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack, are you all right? You look pale -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) head away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fingers. <div class="bookquote">``I am fine!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) recoiled from his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) hot eyes and tried on a smile that was a size too small.
<div class="bookquote">``Well ... if you are ... I'll just go and wait in the park with Danny ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was starting away now, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) smile dissolving into a bewildered expression of
hurt.
He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Wendy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked back from the foot of the stairs. <div class="bookquote">``What, Jack?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) got up and went over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, babe. I guess I'm really not all
right. That machine ... the lens is distorted. I've got a really bad headache.
Got any aspirin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) pawed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) purse and came up with a tin of Anacin. <div class="bookquote">``You keep
them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) took the tin. <div class="bookquote">``No Excedrin?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) saw the small recoil on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face and
understood. It had been a bitter sort of joke between them at first, before the
drinking had gotten too bad for jokes. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had claimed that Excedrin was the only
nonprescription drug ever invented that could stop a hangover dead in its
tracks. Absolutely the only one. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had begun to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) morning-after
thumpers as Excedrin Headache Number Vat 69.
<div class="bookquote">``No Excedrin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Sorry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``these'll do just fine.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But of course they wouldn't,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) should have known it, too. At times she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could be the stupidest bitch ...
<div class="bookquote">``Want some water?''  (<font color='red'><b>the bitch</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) asked brightly.
-LRB-No I just want you to GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!-RRB- .
<div class="bookquote">``I'll get some at the drinking fountain when I go up. Thanks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) started up the stairs, good legs moving gracefully under a short
tan wool skirt. <div class="bookquote">``We'll be in the park.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) slipped the tin of Anacin absently into his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) pocket, went back to
the reader, and turned it off. When he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) went upstairs
himself. God, but it was a lousy headache. If you were going to have a visegripper like this one, you ought to at least be allowed the pleasure of a few
drinks to balance it off.
He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) tried to put the thought from his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) mind, more ill tempered than ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
went to the main desk, fingering a matchbook cover with a telephone number on
it.
<div class="bookquote">``Ma'am, do you have a pay telephone?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, but you can use mine if it's local.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's long-distance, sorry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well then, I guess the drugstore would be your best bet. They have a booth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thanks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) went out and down the walk, past the anonymous Civil War general. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) began
to walk toward the business block, hands stuffed in his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) pockets, head thudding
like a leaden bell. The sky was also leaden; it was November 7, and with the new
month the weather had become threatening. There had been a number of snow
flurries. There had been snow in October too, but that had melted. The new
flurries had stayed, a light frosting over everything
it sparkled in the
sunlight like fine crystal. But there had been no sunlight today, and even as he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
reached the drugstore it began to spit snow again.
The phone booth was at the back of the building, and he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was halfway down an
aisle of patent medicines, jingling his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) change in his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) pocket, when his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) eyes fell
on the white boxes with their green print. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) took one of them to the cashier,
paid, and went back to the telephone booth. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) pulled the door closed, put his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
change and matchbook cover on the counter, and dialed O.
<div class="bookquote">``Your call, please?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fort Lauderdale, Florida, operator.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) the number there and the
number in the booth. When she (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) it would be a dollar ninety for the first
three minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) dropped eight quarters into the slot, wincing each time the
bell bonged in his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) ear.
Then, left in limbo with only the faraway clickings and gabblings of
connection-making, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) took the green-bottle of Excedrin out of its box, pried up
the white cap, and dropped the wad of cotton batting to the floor of the booth.
Cradling the phone receiver between his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) ear and shoulder, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) shook out three of
the white tablets and lined them up on the counter beside his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) remaining change.
He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) recapped the bottle and put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) pocket.
At the other end, the phone was picked up on the first ring.
<div class="bookquote">``Surf-Sand Resort, how may we help you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the perky female voice asked.
<div class="bookquote">``I'd like to speak with the manager, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean Mr. Trent or -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I mean Mr. Ullman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I believe Mr. Ullman is busy, but if you would like me to check -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I would. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) it's Jack Torrance calling from Colorado.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``One moment, please.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) put him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) on hold.
Jack's dislike for that cheap, self-important little prick Ullman came
flooding back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) took one of the Excedrins from the counter, regarded it for a
moment, then put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) mouth and began to chew it, slowly and with relish.
The taste flooded back like memory, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) saliva squirt in mingled pleasure
and unhappiness. A dry, bitter taste, but a compelling one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) swallowed with a
grimace. Chewing aspirin had been a habit with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) drinking days; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)
hadn't done it at all since then. But when your headache was bad enough, a
hangover headache or one like this one, chewing them seemed to make them get to
work quicker. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had read somewhere that chewing aspirin could become addictive.
Where had he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) read that, anyway? Frowning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) tried to think. And then Ullman
came on the line.
<div class="bookquote">``Torrance? What's the trouble?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) said. ``The boiler's okay and I haven't even gotten around to

<p/>murdering my wife yet. I'm saving that until after the holidays, when things get
dull.''
``Very funny. Why are you calling? I'm a busy -- ''
``Busy man, yes, I understand that. I'm calling about some things that you
didn't tell me during your history of the Overlooks great and honorable past.
Like how Horace Derwent sold it to a bunch of Las Vegas sharpies who dealt it
through so many dummy corporations that not even the IRS knew who really owned
it. About how they waited until the time was right and then turned it into a
playground for Mafia bigwigs, and about how it had to be shut down in 1966 when
one of them got a little bit dead. Along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) bodyguards, who were standing
outside the door to the Presidential Suite. Great place, the Overlook's
Presidential Suite. Wilson, Harding, Roosevelt, Nixon, and Vito the Chopper,
right?''
There was a moment of surprised silence on the other end of the line, and then
Ullman said quietly: ``I don't see how that can have any bearing on your job, Mr.
Torrance. It
''
``The best part happened after Gienelli was shot, though, don't you think? Two
more quick shuffles, now you see it and now you don't, and then the Overlook is
suddenly owned by a private citizen, a woman named Sylvia Hunter ... who just
happened to be Sylvia Hunter Derwent from 1942 to 1948.''
``Your three minutes are up,'' the operator said. ``Signal when through.''
``My dear Mr. Torrance, all of this is public knowledge ... and ancient
history.''
``It formed no part of my knowledge,'' Jack said. ``I doubt if many other people
know it, either. Not all of it. They remember the Gienelli shooting, maybe, but
I doubt if anybody has put together all the wondrous and strange shuffles the
Overlook has been through since 1945. And it always seems like Derwent or a
Derwent associate comes up with the door prize. What was Sylvia Hunter running
up there in '67 and '68, Mr. Ullman? It was a whorehouse, wasn't it?''
``Torrance!'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shock crackled across two thousand miles of telephone cable
without losing a thing.
Smiling, Jack popped another Excedrin into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mouth and chewed it.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sold out after a rather well known U.S. senator died of a heart attack up
there. There were rumors that he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) was found naked except for black nylon
stockings and a garter belt and a pair of high-heeled pumps. Patent-leather
pumps, as a matter of fact.''
``That's a vicious, damnable lie!'' Ullman cried.
``Is it?'' Jack asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was beginning to feel better. The headache was
draining away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) took the last Excedrin and chewed it up, enjoying the bitter,
powdery taste as the tablet shredded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mouth.
``It was a very unfortunate occurrence,'' Ullman said. ``Now what is the point,
Torrance? If you're planning to write some ugly smear article ... if this is
some illconceived, stupid blackmail idea...''
``Nothing of the sort,'' Jack said. ``I called because I didn't think you played
square with me. And because -- ''
``Didn't play square?'' Ullman cried. ``My God, did you think I was going to
share a large pile of dirty laundry with the hotel's caretaker? Who in heaven's
name do you think you are? And how could those old stories possibly affect you

<p/>anyway? Or do you think there are ghosts parading up and down the halls of the
west wing wearing bedsheets and crying `Woe!'?''
``No, I don't think there are any ghosts. But you raked up a lot of my personal
history before you gave me the job. You had me on the carpet, quizzing me about
my ability to take care of your hotel like a little boy in front of the
teacher's desk for peeing in the coatroom. You embarrassed me.''
``I just do not believe your cheek, your bloody damned impertinence,'' Ullman
said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) sounded as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) might be choking. ``I'd like to sack you. And perhaps I
will.''
``I think Al Shockley might object. Strenuously.''
``And I think you may have finally overestimated Mr. Shockley's commitment to
you, Mr. Torrance.''
For a moment Jack's headache came back in all its thudding glory, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes against the pain. As if from a distance away he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heard himself
ask: ``Who owns the Overlook now? Is it still Derwent Enterprises? Or are you too
smallfry to know?''
``I think that will do, Mr. Torrance. You are an employee of the hotel, no
different from a busboy or a kitchen pot scrubber. I have no intention of -- ''
``Okay, I'll write Al,'' Jack said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>)'ll know; after all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>)'s on the Board of
Directors. And I might just add a little P.S. to the effect that -- ''
``Derwent doesn't own it.''
``What? I couldn't quite make that out.''
``I said Derwent doesn't own it. The stockholders are all Easterners. Your
friend Mr. Shockley owns the largest block of stock himself, better than thirtyfive per cent. You would know better than I if he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) has any ties to Derwent.''
``Who else?''
``I have no intention of divulging the names of the other stockholders to you,
Mr. Torrance. I intend to bring this whole matter to the attention of -- ''
``One other question.''
``I am under no obligation to you.''
``Most of the Overlook's history -- savory and unsavory alike -- I found in a
scrapbook that was in the cellar. Big thing with white leather covers. Gold
thread for binding. Do you have any idea whose scrapbook that might be?''
``None at all.''
``Is it possible it could have belonged to Grady? The caretaker who killed
himself?''
``Mr. Torrance,'' Ullman said in tones of deepest frost, ``I am by no means sure
that Mr. Grady could read, let alone dig out the rotten apples you have been
wasting my time with.''
``I'm thinking of writing a book about the Overlook Hotel. I thought if I
actually got through it, the owner of the scrapbook would like to have an
acknowledgment at the front.''
``I think writing a book about the Overlook would be very unwise,'' Ullman said.
``Especially a book done from your ... uh, point of view.''
<div class="bookquote">``Your opinion doesn't surprise me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) headache was all gone now. There had
been that one flash of pain, and that was all. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) mind felt sharp and accurate,
all the way down to millimeters. It was the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) usually felt only when the
writing was going extremely well or when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had a threedrink buzz on. That was

<p/>another thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had forgotten about Excedrin; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) didn't know if it worked for
others, but for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) crunching three tablets was like an instant high.
Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``What you'd like is some sort of commissioned guidebook that you
could hand out free to the guests when they checked in. Something with a lot of
glossy photos of the mountains at sunrise and sunset and a lemon-meringue text
to go with it. Also a section on the colorful people who have stayed there, of
course excluding the really colorful ones like Gienelli and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gienelli</b></font>) friends.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If I felt I could fire you and be a hundred per cent certain of my own job
instead of just ninety-five per cent,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>UIIman said in clipped, strangled tones,
<div class="bookquote">``I would fire you right this minute, over the telephone. But since I feel that
five per cent of uncertainty, I intend to call Mr. Shockley the moment you're
off the line ... which will be soon, or so I devoutly hope.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said, <div class="bookquote">``There isn't going to be anything in the book that isn't true, you
know. There's no need to dress it up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Why are you baiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)? Do you want to be fired?-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``I don't care if Chapter Five is about the Pope of Rome screwing the shade of
the Virgin Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ullman/Mr. Ullman</b></font>)</div>Ullman said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) voice rising. <div class="bookquote">``I want you out of my hotel!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's not your hotel!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack screamed, and slammed the receiver into its
cradle.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) sat on the stool breathing hard, a little scared now,
-LRB-a little? hell, a lot-RRB-
wondering why in the name of God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had called Ullman in the first place.
-LRB-You lost your temper again, Jack.-RRB-
Yes. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had. No sense trying to deny it. And the hell of it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had
no idea how much influence that cheap little prick had over Al, no more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>)
knew how much bullshit Al would take from him (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) in the name of auld lang syne. If
Ullman was as good as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) claimed to be, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) gave Al a he-goes-or-I-go
ultimatum, might not Al be forced to take it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) eyes and tried to
imagine telling Wendy. Guess what, babe? I lost another job. This time I had to
go through two thousand miles of Bell Telephone cable to find someone to punch
out, but I managed it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) eyes and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) mouth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) handkerchief. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) wanted a
drink. Hell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) needed one. There was a cafe just down the street, surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) had
time for a quick beer on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) way up to the park, just one to lay the dust ...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) hands together helplessly.
The question recurred: Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) called Ullman in the first place? The number
of the Surf-Sand in Lauderdale had been written in a small notebook by the phone
and the CB radio in the office-plumbers' numbers, carpenters, glaziers,
electricians, others. Jack had copied it onto the matchbook cover shortly after
getting out of bed, the idea of calling Ullman fullblown and gleeful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)
mind. But to what purpose? Once, during the drinking phase, Wendy had accused
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) of desiring his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) own destruction but not possessing the necessary moral fiber
to support a full-blown deathwish. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) manufactured ways in which other people
could do it, lopping a piece at a time off himself and their family. Could it be
true? Was be afraid somewhere inside that the Overlook might be just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)
needed to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) play and generally collect tip his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) shit and get it
together? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) blowing the whistle on himself? Please God no, don't let it be
that way. Please.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes and an image immediately arose on the darkened screen of
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) inner lids: sticking his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand through that hole in the shingles to pull out
the rotted flashing, the sudden needling sting, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own agonized, startled cry
in the still and unheeding air: Oh you goddamn fucking son of a bitch ...
Replaced with an image two years earlier, himself stumbling into the house at
three in the morning, drunk, falling over a table and sprawling full-length on
the floor, cursing, waking Wendy up on the couch. Wendy turning on the light,
seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) clothes ripped and smeared from some cloudy parking-lot scuffle that
had occurred at a vaguely remembered honky-tonk just over the New Hampshire
border hours before, crusted blood under his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) nose, now looking up at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wife,
blinking stupidly in the light like a mole in the sunshine, and Wendy saying
dully, You son of a bitch, you woke Danny up. If you don't care about yourself,
can't you care a little bit about us? Oh, why do I even bother talking to you?
The telephone rang, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) jump. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) snatched it off the cradle,
illogically sure it must be either Ullman or Al Shockley. <div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) barked.
<div class="bookquote">``Your overtime, sir. Three dollars and fifty cents.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll have to break some ones,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) put the phone on the shelf, deposited his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) last six quarters, then went out
to the cashier to get more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) performed the transaction automatically, his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) mind
running in a single closed circle like a squirrel on an exercise wheel.
Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) called Ullman?
Because Ullman had embarrassed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had been embarrassed before, and by
real masters
the Grand Master, of course, being himself. Simply to crow at the
man, expose his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hypocrisy? Jack didn't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was that petty. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mind tried
to seize on the scrapbook as a valid reason, but that wouldn't hold water
either. The chances of Ullman knowing who the owner was were no more than two in
a thousand. At the interview, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had treated the cellar as another country
a
nasty underdeveloped one at that. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had really wanted to know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) would have
called Watson, whose winter number was also in the office notebook. Even Watson
would not have been a sure thing but surer than Ullman.
And telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) about the book idea, that had been another stupid thing.
Incredibly stupid. Besides jeopardizing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) job, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) could be closing off wide
channels of information once Ullman called around and told people to beware of
New Englanders bearing questions about the Overlook Hotel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) could have done
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) researches quietly, mailing off polite letters, perhaps even arranging some
interviews in the spring ... and then laughed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) sleeve at Ullman's rage
when the book came out and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) was safely away
The Masked Author Strikes Again.
Instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had made that damned senseless call, lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) temper, antagonized
Ullman, and brought out all of the hotel manager's Little Caesar tendencies.
Why? If it wasn't an effort to get himself thrown out of the good job Al had
snagged for him (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>), then what was it?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) deposited the rest of the money in the slots and hung up the phone. It
really was the senseless kind of thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) might have done if he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) had been drunk.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) had been sober; dead cold sober.
Walking out of the drugstore be crunched another Excedrin into his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) mouth,
grimacing yet relishing the bitter taste.
On the walk outside he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) met Wendy and Danny.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, we were just coming after you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said. <div class="bookquote">``Snowing, don't you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div><p/>Jack blinked up. <div class="bookquote">``So it is.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was snowing hard. Sidewinder's main street was
already heavily powdered, the center line obscured. Danny had his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head tilted up
to the white sky, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth open and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tongue out to catch some of the fat
flakes drifting down.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you think this is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy asked.
Jack shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I was hoping for another week or two of grace.
We still might get it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grace</b></font>)</div>Grace, that was it.
-LRB-I'm sorry, Al.. Grace, your mercy. For your mercy. One more chance. I am
heartily sorry -- -RRB-
How many times, over how many years, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) -- a grown man -- asked for the mercy
of another chance? He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was suddenly so sick of himself, so revolted, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
could have groaned aloud.
<div class="bookquote">``How's your headache?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) asked, studying him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) closely.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) put an arm around her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) and hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) tight. <div class="bookquote">``Better. Come on, you two,
let's go home while we still can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>They walked back to where the hotel truck was slantparked against the curb,
Jack in the middle, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) left arm around Wendy's shoulders, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) right hand
holding Danny's hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had called it home for the first time, for better or
worse.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) got behind the truck's wheel it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) that while he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was
fascinated by the Overlook, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) didn't much like it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wasn't sure it was good
for either his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wife or his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) son or himself. Maybe that was why he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had called
Ullman.
To be fired while there was still time.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) backed the truck out of its parking space and headed them out of town and
up into the mountains.

NIGHT THOUGHTS
It was ten o'clock. Their quarters were filled with counterfeit sleep.
Jack lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) side facing the wall, eyes open, listening to Wendy's slow and
regular breathing. The taste of dissolved aspirin was still on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) tongue,
making it feel rough and slightly numb. Al Shockley had called at quarter of
six, quarter of eight back East. Wendy had been downstairs with Danny, sitting
in front of the lobby fireplace and reading.
<div class="bookquote">``Person to person,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the operator said, <div class="bookquote">``for Mr. Jack Torrance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Speaking.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had switched the phone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) right hand, had dug his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
handkerchief out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) back pocket with his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) left, and had wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tender lips
with it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lit a cigarette.

<p/>Al's voice then, strong in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ear: <div class="bookquote">``Jacky-boy, what in the name of God are
you up to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Al</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hi, Al.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) snuffed the cigarette and groped for the Excedrin bottle.
<div class="bookquote">``What's going on, Jack? I got this weird phone call from Stuart Ullman this
afternoon. And when Stu Ullman calls long-distance out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) own pocket, you
know the shit has hit the fan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ullman has nothing to worry about, Al.. Neither do you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What exactly is the nothing we don't have to worry about? Stu made it sound
like a cross between blackmail and a National Enquirer feature on the Overlook.
Talk to me, boy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to poke him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``When I came up here to be
interviewed, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had to drag out all my dirty laundry. Drinking problem. Lost
your last job for racking over a student. Wonder if you're the right man for
this. Et cetera. The thing that bugged me was that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was bringing all this up
because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved the goddamn hotel so much. The beautiful Overlook. The
traditional Overlook. The bloody sacred Overlook. Well, I found a scrapbook in
the basement. Somebody had put together all the less savory aspects of Ullman's
cathedral, and it looked to me like a little black mass had been going on after
hours.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hope that's metaphorical, Jack.''  (<font color='red'><b>Al</b></font>)</div>Al's voice sounded frighteningly cold.
<div class="bookquote">``It is. But I did find out -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know the hotel's history.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack ran a hand through his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hair. <div class="bookquote">``So I called him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) up and poked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) with it. I
admit it wasn't very bright, and I sure wouldn't do it again. End of story.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stu says you're planning to do a little dirty-laundry-airing yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stu is an asshole!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) barked into the phone. <div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Stu</b></font>) I had an idea of
writing about the Overlook, yes. I do. I think this place forms an index of the
whole post-World War II American character. That sounds like an inflated claim,
stated so baldly ... I know it does ... but it's all here, Al! My God, it
could be a great book. But it's far in the future, I can promise you that, I've
got more on my plate right now than I can eat, and -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jack, that's not good enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) found himself gaping at the black receiver of the phone, unable to believe
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had surely heard. <div class="bookquote">``What? Al, did you say -- ?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I said what I said. How long is far in the future, Jack? For you it may be
two years, maybe five. For me it's thirty or forty, because I expect to be
associated with the Overlook for a long time. The thought of you doing some sort
of a scum-job on my hotel and passing it off as a great piece of American
writing, that makes me sick.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack was speechless.
<div class="bookquote">``I tried to help you, Jacky-boy. We went through the war together, and I
thought I owed you some help. You remember the war?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I remember it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) muttered, but the coals of resentment had begun to glow
around his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heart. First Ullman, then Wendy, now Al.. What was this? National
Let's Pick Jack Torrance Apart Week? He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) clamped his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) lips more tightly together,
reached for his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) cigarettes, and knocked them off onto the floor. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) ever
liked this cheap prick talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) mahogany-lined den in Vermont?
Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) really?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Before you hit that Hatfield kid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Al</b></font>)</div>Al was saying, <div class="bookquote">``I had talked the Board out
of letting you go and even had them swung around to considering tenure. You blew
that one for yourself. I got you this hotel thing, a nice quiet place for you to
get yourself together, finish your play, and wait it out until Harry Effinger
and I could convince the rest of those guys that they made a big mistake. Now it
looks like you want to chew my arm off on your way to a bigger killing. Is that
the way you say thanks to your friends, Jack?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Al</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) whispered.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) didn't dare say more. His (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) head was throbbing with the hot, acid-etched
words that wanted to get out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) tried desperately to think of Danny and Wendy,
depending on him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), Danny and Wendy sitting peacefully downstairs in front of the
fire and working on the first of the second-grade reading primers, thinking
everything was A-OK. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lost this job, what then? Off to California in that
tired old VW with the distintegrating fuel pump like a family of dustbowl Okies?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) told himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would get down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knees and beg Al before he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) let that
happen, but still the words struggled to pour out, and the hand holding the hot
wires of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) rage felt greased.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Al</b></font>)</div>Al said sharply.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That is not the way I treat my friends. And you know it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How do I know it? At the worst, you're planning to smear my hotel by digging
up bodies that were decently buried years ago. At the best, you call up my
temperamental but extremely competent hotel manager and work him (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) into a frenzy
as part of some ... some stupid kid's game.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was more than a game, Al.. It's easier for you. You don't have to take some
rich friend's charity. You don't need a friend in court because you are the
court. The fact that you were one step from a brown-bag lush goes pretty much
unmentioned, doesn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Al</b></font>)</div>Al said. His (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) voice had dropped a notch and he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) sounded
tired of the whole thing. <div class="bookquote">``But Jack, Jack ... I can't help that. I can't
change that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said emptily. <div class="bookquote">``Am I fired? I guess you better tell me if I am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not if you'll do two things for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hadn't you better hear the conditions before you accept them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. Give me your deal and I'll take it. There's Wendy and Danny to think
about. If you want my balls, I'll send them airmail.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure selfpity is a luxury you can afford, Jack?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes and slid an Excedrin between his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) dry lips. <div class="bookquote">``At this
point I feel it's the only one I can afford. Fire away ... no pun intended.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Al</b></font>)</div>Al was silent for a moment. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``First, no more calls to Ullman. Not
even if the place burns down. If that happens, call the maintenance man, that
guy who swears all the time, you know who I mean ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Watson.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay. Done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Second, you promise me, Jack. Word of honor. No book about a famous Colorado
mountain hotel with a history.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>For a moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) rage was so great that be literally could not speak. The

<p/>blood beat loudly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) ears. It was like getting a call from some twentiethcentury Medici prince ... no portraits of my family with their warts showing,
please, or back to the rabble you'll go. I subsidize no pictures but pretty
pictures. When you paint the daughter of my good friend and business partner,
please omit birthmark or back to the rabble you'll go. Of course we're friends...
we are both civilized men aren't we? We've shared bed and board and bottle.
We'll always be friends, and the dog collar I have on you will always be ignored
by mutual consent, and I'll take good and benevolent care of you. All I ask in
return is your soul. Small item. We can even ignore the fact that you've handed
it over, the way we ignore the dog collar. Remember, my talented friend, there
are Michelangelos begging everywhere in the streets of Rome ...
<div class="bookquote">``Jack? You there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) made a strangled noise that was intended to be the word yes.
Al's voice was firm and very sure of itself. <div class="bookquote">``I really don't think I'm asking
so much, Jack. And there will be other books. You just can't expect me to
subsidize you while you ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right, agreed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to think I'm trying to control your artistic life, Jack. You
know me better than that. It's just that
''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is Derwent still involved with the Overlook? Somehow?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how that can possibly be any concern of yours, Jack.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) said distantly. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose it isn't. Listen, Al, I think I hear Wendy
calling me for something. I'll get back to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure thing, Jacky-boy. We'll have a good talk. How are things? Dry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>ALL</b></font>)</div>YOU'VE GOT YOUR POUND OF FLESH BLOOD AND ALL NOW CAN'T YOU LEAVE
ME ALONE?-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``As a bone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Here too. I'm actually beginning to enjoy sobriety. If -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll get back, Al.. Wendy -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure. Okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) had hung up and that was when the cramps had come, hitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) like
lightning bolts, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) curl up in front of the telephone like a penitent,
hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) belly, head throbbing like a monstrous bladder.
The moving wasp, having stung moves on ...
It had passed a little when Wendy came upstairs and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) who had been on
the phone.
<div class="bookquote">``Al,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) called to ask how things were going. I said they were
fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jack, you look terrible. Are you sick?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Headache's back. I'm going to bed early. No sense trying to write.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can I get you some warm milk?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) smiled wanly. <div class="bookquote">``That would be nice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) lay beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) warm and sleeping thigh against his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>)
own. Thinking of the conversation with Al, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) had groveled, still made him (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>)
hot and cold by turns. Someday there would be a reckoning. Someday there would
be a book, not the soft and thoughtful thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) had first considered, but a gemhard work of research, photo section and all, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) would pull apart the entire

<p/>Overlook history, nasty, incestuous ownership deals and all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) would spread it
all out for the reader like a dissected crayfish. And if Al Shockley had
connections with the Derwent empire, then God help him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
Strung up like piano wire, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lay staring into the dark, knowing it might be
hours yet before he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could sleep.
***
Wendy Torrance lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) back, eyes closed, listening to the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>)
husband's slumber -- the long inhale, the brief hold, the slightly guttural
exhale. Where did he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) go when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) slept, she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) wondered. To some amusement park, a
Great Barrington of dreams where all the rides were free and there was no wifemother along to tell them they'd had enough hotdogs or that they'd better be
going if they wanted to get home by dark? Or was it some fathoms-deep bar where
the drinking never stopped and the batwings were always propped open and all the
old companions were gathered around the electronic hockey game, glasses in hand,
Al Shockley prominent among them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) tie loosened and the top button of his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>)
shirt undone? A place where both she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) and Danny were excluded and the boogie went
on endlessly?
Wendy was worried about him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), the old, helpless worry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had hoped was
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) forever in Vermont, as if worry could somehow not cross state lines.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) didn't like what the Overlook seemed to be doing to Jack and Danny.
The most frightening thing, vaporous and unmentioned, perhaps unmentionable,
was that all of Jack's drinking symptoms had come back, one by one ... all but
the drink itself. The constant wiping of the lips with hand or handkerchief, as
if to rid them of excess moisture. Long pauses at the typewriter, more balls of
paper in the wastebasket. There had been a bottle of Excedrin on the telephone
table tonight after Al had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>), but no water glass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) had been chewing
them again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) got irritated over little things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) would unconsciously start
snapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) fingers in a nervous rhythm when things got too quiet. Increased
profanity. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had begun to worry about his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) temper, too. It would almost come as
a relief if he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) would lose it, blow off steam, in much the same way that he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) went
down to the basement first thing in the morning and last thing at night to dump
the press on the boiler. It would almost be good to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) curse and kick a
chair across the room or slam a door. But those things, always an integral part
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) temperament, had almost wholly ceased. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had the feeling that Jack
was more and more often angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) or Danny, but was refusing to let it out.
The boiler had a pressure gauge: old, cracked, clotted with grease, but still
workable. Jack had none. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had never been able to read him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) very well. Danny
could, but Danny wasn't talking.
And the call from Al.. At about the same time it had come, Danny had lost all
interest in the story they had been reading. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) to sit by the fire and
crossed to the main desk where Jack had constructed a roadway for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) matchbox
cars and trucks. The Violent Violet Volkswagen was there and Danny had begun to
push it rapidly back and forth. Pretending to read her (<font color='blue'><b>Violet</b></font>) own book but actually
looking at Danny over the top of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Violet</b></font>) had seen an odd amalgam of the ways she (<font color='blue'><b>Violet</b></font>)
and Jack expressed anxiety. The wiping of the lips. Running both hands nervously
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hair, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Violet</b></font>) had done while waiting for Jack to come home from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)

<p/>round of the bars. She (<font color='blue'><b>Violet</b></font>) couldn't believe Al had called just to <div class="bookquote">``ask how things
were going.''  (<font color='red'><b>Al/Uncle Al</b></font>)</div>If you wanted to shoot the bull, you called Al.. When Al called you,
that was business.
Later, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Violet</b></font>) had come back downstairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Violet</b></font>) had found Danny curled up by the
fire again, reading the second-grade-primer adventures of Joe and Rachel at the
circus with their daddy in complete, absorbed attention. The fidgety distraction
had completely disappeared. Watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) had been struck again by the eerie
certainty that Danny knew more and understood more than there was room for in
Dr. -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Just call me Bill'' (<font color='red'><b>Dr.</b></font>)</div>-RRB- Edmonds's philosophy.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, time for bed, doc,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>)'d said.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) marked his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) place in the book and stood up.
<div class="bookquote">``Wash up and brush your teeth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't forget to use the floss.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I won't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They stood side by side for a moment, watching the wax and wane of the coals
of the fire. Most of the lobby was chilly and drafty, but this circle around the
fireplace was magically warm, and hard to leave.
<div class="bookquote">``It was Uncle Al on the phone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) said casually.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh yeah?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Totally unsurprised.
<div class="bookquote">``I wonder if Uncle Al was mad at Daddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) said, still casually.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) sure was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said, still watching the fire. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) didn't want
Daddy to write the book.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What book, Danny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``About the hotel.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The question framed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) lips was one she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) and Jack had asked Danny a
thousand times: How do you know that? She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) hadn't asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) didn't want to
upset him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) before bed, or make him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) aware that they were casually discussing his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
knowledge of things he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had no way of knowing at all. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) did know, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) was
convinced of that. Dr. Edmonds's patter about inductive reasoning and
subconscious logic was just that: patter. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) sister ... how had Danny known
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) was thinking about Aileen in the waiting room that day? And
-LRB-I dreamed Daddy had an accident.-RRB-
She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) head, as if to clear it. <div class="bookquote">``Go wash up, doc.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ran up the stairs toward their quarters. Frowning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) had gone
into the kitchen to warm Jack's milk in a saucepan.
And now, lying wakeful in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) bed and listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) husband's breathing and
the wind outside -LRB-miraculously, they'd had only another flurry that afternoon;
still no heavy snow-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) mind turn fully to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) lovely, troubling son,
born with a caul over his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) face, a simple tissue of membrane that doctors saw
perhaps once in every seven hundred births, a tissue that the old wives' tales
said betokened the second sight.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) decided that it was time to talk to Danny about the Overlook ... and
high time she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) tried to get Danny to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>). Tomorrow. For sure. The two of
them would be going down to the Sidewinder Public Library to see if they could
get him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) some second-grade-level books on an extended loan through the winter,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) would talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). And frankly. With that thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) felt a little
easier, and at last began to drift toward sleep.

<p/>***
Danny lay awake in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bedroom, eyes open, left arm encircling his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) aged and
slightly worse-for-wear Pooh -LRB-Pooh had lost one shoe-button eye and was oozing
stuffing from half a dozen sprung seams-RRB-, listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pooh</b></font>) parents sleep in
their bedroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pooh</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pooh</b></font>) were standing unwilling guard over them. The
nights were the worst of all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pooh</b></font>) hated the nights and the constant howl of the
wind around the west side of the hotel.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Pooh</b></font>) glider floated overhead from a string. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Pooh</b></font>) bureau the VW model, brought
up from the roadway setup downstairs, glowed a dimly fluorescent purple. His (<font color='blue'><b>Pooh</b></font>)
books were in the bookcase, his (<font color='blue'><b>Pooh</b></font>) coloring books on the desk. A place for
everything and everything in its place. Mommy said. Then you know where it is
when you want it. But now things had been misplaced. Things were missing. Worse
still, things had been added, things you couldn't quite see, like in one of
those pictures that said CAN YOU SEE THE INDIANS? And if you strained and
squinted, you could see some of them
the thing you had taken for a cactus at
first glance was really a brave with a knife clamped in his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) teeth, and there
were others hiding in the rocks, and you could even see one of their evil,
merciless faces peering through the spokes of a covered wagon wheel. But you
could never see all of them, and that was what made you uneasy. Because it was
the ones you couldn't see that would sneak up behind you, a tomahawk in one hand
and a scalping knife in the other ...
He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) shifted uneasily in his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) bed, his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) eyes searching out the comforting glow of
the night light. Things were worse here. He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) knew that much for sure. At first
they hadn't been so bad, but little by little ... his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) daddy thought about
drinking a lot more. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was angry at Mommy and didn't know why. He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)
went around wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) lips with his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) handkerchief and his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) eyes were far away and
cloudy. Mommy was worried about him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) and Danny, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't have to shine into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) to know that; it had been in the anxious way she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) on the
day the fire hose had seemed to turn into a snake. Mr. Hallorann said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) thought
all mothers could shine a little bit, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had known on that day that
something had happened. But not what.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) had almost told her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), but a couple of things had held him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) knew that
the doctor in Sidewinder had dismissed Tony and the things that Tony showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)
as perfectly
-LRB-well almost-RRB-
normal. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) mother might not believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) about the hose. Worse,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) in the wrong way, might think he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) was LOSING HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) MARBLES.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) understood a little about LOSING YOUR MARBLES, not as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) did about
GETTING A BABY, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) mommy had explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) the year before at some
length, but enough.
Once, at nursery school, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) friend Scott had pointed out a boy named Robin
Stenger, who was moping around the swings with a face almost long enough to step
on. Robin's father taught arithmetic at Daddy's school, and Scott's daddy taught
history there. Most of the kids at the nursery school were associated either
with Stovington Prep or with the small IBM plant just outside of town. The prep
kids chummed in one group, the IBM kids in another. There were cross-

<p/>friendships, of course, but it was natural enough for the kids whose fathers
knew each other to more or less stick together. When there was an adult scandal
in one group, it almost always filtered down to the children in some wildly
mutated form or other, but it rarely jumped to the other group.
He (<font color='blue'><b>IBM</b></font>) and Scotty were sitting in the play rocketship when Scotty jerked his (<font color='blue'><b>Scotty</b></font>) thumb
at Robin and said: <div class="bookquote">``You know that kid?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Robin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said.
Scott leaned forward. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) dad LOST HIS (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) MARBLES last night. They took him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>)
away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah? Just for losing some marbles?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Scotty</b></font>)</div>Scotty looked disgusted. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) went crazy. You know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Scott/miss Scott</b></font>)</div>Scott crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Scotty</b></font>) eyes,
flopped out his (<font color='blue'><b>Scotty</b></font>) tongue, and twirled his (<font color='blue'><b>Scotty</b></font>) index fingers in large elliptical orbits
around his (<font color='blue'><b>Scotty</b></font>) ears. <div class="bookquote">``They took him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) to THE BUGHOUSE.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. <div class="bookquote">``When will they let him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) come back?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never-never-never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Scotty</b></font>)</div>Scotty said darkly.
In the course of that day and the next, Danny heard that
a.-RRB- Mr. Stenger had tried to kill everybody in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) family, including Robin,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) World War II souvenir pistol;
b.-RRB- Mr. Stenger ripped the house to pieces while he (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) was STINKO;
c.-RRB- Mr. Stenger had been discovered eating a bowl of dead bugs and grass like
they were cereal and milk and crying while he (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) did it;
d.-RRB- Mr. Stenger had tried to strangle his (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) wife with a stocking when the Red
Sox lost a big ball game.
Finally, too troubled to keep it to himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) had asked Daddy about Mr.
Stenger. His (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) daddy had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) lap and had explained that Mr. Stenger
had been under a great deal of strain, some of it about his (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) family and some
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) job and some of it about things that nobody but doctors could
understand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) had been having crying fits, and three nights ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) had gotten
crying and couldn't stop it and had broken a lot of things in the Stenger home.
It wasn't LOSING YOUR MARBLES, Daddy said, it was HAVING A BREAKDOWN, and Mr.
Stenger wasn't in a BUGHOUSE but in a SANNY-TARIUM. But despite Daddy's careful
explanations, Danny was scared. There didn't seem to be any difference at all
between LOSING YOUR MARBLES and HAVING A BREAKDOWN, and whether you called it
a BUGHOUSE or a SANNYTARIUM, there were still bars on the windows and they
wouldn't let you out if you wanted to go. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father, quite innocently, had
confirmed another of Scotty's phrases unchanged, one that filled Danny with a
vague and unformed dread. In the place where Mr. Stenger now lived, there were
THE MEN IN THE WHITE COATS. They came to get you in a truck with no windows, a
truck that was gravestone gray. It rolled up to the curb in front of your house
and THE MEN IN THE WHITE COATS got out and took you away from your family and
made you live in a room with soft walls. And if you wanted to write home, you
had to do it with Crayolas.
<div class="bookquote">``When will they let him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) come back?''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father.
<div class="bookquote">``Just as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>)'s better, doc.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But when will that be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny had persisted.
<div class="bookquote">``Dan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said, <div class="bookquote">``NO ONE KNOWS.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>And that was the worst of all. It was another way of saying never-never-never.
A month later, Robin's mother took him (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) out of nursery school and they moved away

<p/>from Stovington without Mr. Stenger.
That had been over a year ago, after Daddy stopped taking the Bad Stuff but
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) job. Danny still thought about it often. Sometimes when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fell down or bumped his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head or had a bellyache, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would begin to cry and
the memory would flash over him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), accompanied by the fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would not be
able to stop crying, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would just go on and on, weeping and wailing, until
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy went to the phone, dialed it, and said: <div class="bookquote">``Hello? This is Jack Torrance
at 149 Mapleline Way. My son here can't stop crying. Please send THE MEN IN THE
WHITE COATS to take him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to the SANNY-TARIUM. That's right, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s LOST HIS (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
MARBLES. Thank you.''  (<font color='red'><b>daddy</b></font>)</div>And the gray truck with no windows would come rolling up to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) door, they would load him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) in, still weeping hysterically, and take him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) away.
When would he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) see his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mommy and daddy again? NO ONE KNOWS.
It was this fear that had kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) silent. A year older, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was quite sure
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy and mommy wouldn't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) be taken away for thinking a fire hose
was a snake, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) rational mind was sure of that, but still, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thought of
telling them, that old memory rose up like a stone filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth and
blocking words. It wasn't like Tony; Tony had always seemed perfectly natural
-LRB-until the bad dreams, of course-RRB-, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) parents had also seemed to accept
Tony as a more or less natural phenomenon. Things like Tony came from being
BRIGHT, which they both assumed he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) was -LRB-the same way they assumed they were
BRIGHT-RRB-, but a fire hose that turned into a snake, or seeing blood and brains on
the wall of the Presidential Sweet when no one else could, those things would
not be natural. They had already taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) to see a regular doctor. Was it not
reasonable to assume that THE MEN IN THE WHITE COATS might come next?
Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) might have told them except he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) was sure, sooner or later, that they
would want to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) away from the hotel. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) wanted desperately to get
away from the Overlook. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) also knew that this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) daddy's last chance,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) was here at the Overlook to do more than take care of the place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) was
here to work on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) papers. To get over losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) job. To love Mommy/Wendy. And
until very recently, it had seemed that all those things were happening. It was
only lately that Daddy had begun to have trouble. Since he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) found those papers.
-LRB-This inhuman place makes human monsters.-RRB-
What did that mean? He (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) had prayed to God, but God hadn't told him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). And what
would Daddy do if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stopped working here? He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had tried to find out from Daddy's
mind, and had become more and more convinced that Daddy didn't know. The
strongest proof had come earlier this evening when Uncle Al had called his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) daddy
up on the phone and said mean things and Daddy didn't dare say anything back
because Uncle Al could fire him (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) from this job just the way that Mr. Crommert,
the Stovington headmaster, and the Board of Directors had fired him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
schoolteaching job. And Daddy was scared to death of that, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) and Mommy as
well as himself.
So he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) didn't dare say anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) could only watch helplessly and hope that
there really weren't any Indians at all, or if there were that they would be
content to wait for bigger game and let their little three-wagon train pass
unmolested.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) couldn't believe it, no matter how hard he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) tried.
Things were worse at the Overlook now.
The snow was coming, and when it did, any prior options he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had would be

<p/>abrogated. And after the snow, what? What then, when they were shut in and at
the mercy of whatever might have only been toying with them before?
-LRB-Come out here and take your medicine!-RRB-
What then? REDRUM.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) shivered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) bed and turned over again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) could read more now. Tomorrow
maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) would try to call Tony, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) would try to make Tony show him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) exactly what
REDRUM was and if there was any way he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) could prevent it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) would risk the
nightmares. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) had to know.
Danny was still awake long after his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) parents' false sleep had become the real
thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) rolled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bed, twisting the sheets, grappling with a problem years
too big for him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), awake in the night like a single sentinel on picket. And
sometime after midnight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) slept too and then only the wind was awake, prying
at the hotel and hooting in its gables under the bright gimlet gaze of the
stars.

<p/><< 22 >>
IN THE TRUCK
I see a bad moon a-rising.
I see trouble on the way.
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see bad times today.
Don't go `round tonight,
It's bound to take your life,
There's a bad moon on the rise.*
Someone had added a very old Buick car radio under the hotel truck's
dashboard, and now, tinny and choked with static, the distinctive sound of John
Fogerty's Creedence Clearwater Revival band came out of the speaker. Wendy and
Danny were on their way down to Sidewinder. The day was clear and bright. Danny
was turning Jack's orange library card over and over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands and seemed
cheerful enough, but Wendy thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked drawn and tired, as if be hadn't
been sleeping enough and was going on nervous energy alone.
The song ended and the disc jockey came on. ``Yeah, that's Creedence. And
speakin of bad moon, it looks like it may be risin over the KMTX listening area
before long, hard as it is to believe with the beautiful, springlike weather
we've enjoyed for the last couple-three days. The KMTX Fearless Forecaster says
high pressure will give way by one o'clock this afternoon to a widespread lowpressure area which is just gonna grind to a stop in our KMTX area, up where the
air is rare. Temperatures will fall rapidly, and precipitation should start

<p/>around dusk. Elevations under seven thousand feet, including the metro-Denver
area, can expect a mixture of sleet and snow, perhaps freezing on some roads,
and nothin but snow up here, cuz. We're lookin at one to three inches below
seven thousand and possible accumulations of six to ten inches in Central
Colorado and on the Slope. The Highway Advisory Board says that if you're
plannin to tour the mountains in your car this afternoon or tonight, you should
remember that the chain law will be in effect. And don't go nowhere unless you
have to. Remember,'' the announcer added jocularly, ``that's how the Donners got
into trouble. They just weren't as close to the nearest Seven-Eleven as they
thought.''
A Clairol commercial came on, and Wendy reached down and snapped the radio
off. ``You mind?''
``Huh-uh, that's okay.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>announcer</b></font>) glanced out at the sky, which was bright blue.
``Guess Daddy picked just the right day to trim those hedge animals, didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''
``I guess he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did,'' Wendy said.
``Sure doesn't look much like snow, though,'' Danny added hopefully.
``Getting cold feet?'' Wendy asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was still thinking about that crack the
disc jockey had made about the Donner Party.
``Nah, I guess not.''
Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought, this is the time. If you're going to bring it up, do it now
or forever hold your peace.
``Danny,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) voice as casual as possible, ``would you be
happier if we went away from the Overlook? If we didn't stay the winter?''
Danny looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands. ``I guess so,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. ``Yeah. But it's Daddy's
job.''
``Sometimes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said carefully, ``I get the idea that Daddy might be happier
away from the Overlook, too.'' They passed a sign which read SIDEWINDER 18 mi.
and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) took the truck cautiously around a hairpin and shifted up into
second. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) took no chances on these downgrades; they scared her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) silly.
``Do you really think so?'' Danny asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) with interest for a
moment and then shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head. ``No, I don't think so.''
``Why not?''
``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s worried about us,'' Danny said, choosing his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) words carefully. It
was hard to explain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) understood so little of it himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) found himself
harking back to an incident he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had told Mr. Hallorann about, the big kid looking
at department store TV sets and wanting to steal one. That had been distressing,
but at least it had been clear what was going on, even to Danny, then little
more than an infant. But grownups were always in a turmoil, every possible
action muddied over by thoughts of the consequences, by self-doubt, by
selfimage, by feelings of love and responsibility. Every possible choice seemed
to have drawbacks, and sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't understand why the drawbacks were
drawbacks. It was very hard.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thinks ...'' Danny began again, and then looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother quickly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was watching the road, not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could go on.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thinks maybe we'll be lonely. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thinks that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) likes it here and
it's a good place for us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) loves us and doesn't want us to be lonely ... or
sad ... but he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thinks even if we are, it might be okay in the LONGRUN. Do you
know LONGRUN?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear. I do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s worried that if we left he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) couldn't get another job. That we'd have to
beg, or something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that all?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, but the rest is all mixed up. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s different now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, almost sighing. The grade eased a little and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shifted
cautiously back to third gear.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not making this up, Mommy. Honest to God.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, and smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Did Tony tell you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I just know. That doctor didn't believe in Tony, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never mind that doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I believe in Tony. I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)
is or who he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) is, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)'s a part of you that's special or if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) comes from ...
somewhere outside, but I do believe in him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>), Danny. And if you ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ...
think we should go, we will. The two of us will go and be together with Daddy
again in the spring.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with sharp hope. <div class="bookquote">``Where? A motel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hon, we couldn't afford a motel. It would have to be at my mother's.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>The hope in Danny's face died out. <div class="bookquote">``I know -- ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said, and stopped.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) muttered.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shifted back to second as the grade steepened again. <div class="bookquote">``No, doc, please
don't say that. This talk is something we should have had weeks ago, I think. So
please. What is it you know? I won't be mad. I can't be mad, because this is too
important. Talk straight to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know how you feel about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said, and sighed.
<div class="bookquote">``How do I feel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said, and then rhyming, singsong, frightening her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Bad. Sad.
Mad. It's like she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wasn't your mommy at all. Like she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wanted to eat you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), frightened. <div class="bookquote">``And I don't like it there. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s always thinking
about how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be better for me than you. And how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could get me away
from you. Mommy, I don't want to go there. I'd rather be at the Overlook than
there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy was shaken. Was it that bad between her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and hermother? God, what hell
for the boy if it was and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could really read their thoughts for each other.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) suddenly felt more naked than naked, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had been caught in an obscene
act.
<div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``All right, Danny.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're mad at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said in a small, near-to-tears voice.
<div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not. Really I'm not. I'm just sort of shook up.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They were passing a
SIDEWINDER 15 mi. sign, and Wendy relaxed a little. From here on in the road was
better.
<div class="bookquote">``I want to ask you one more question, Danny. I want you to answer it as
truthfully as you can. Will you do that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mommy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, almost whispering.
<div class="bookquote">``Has your daddy been drinking again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, and smothered the two words that rose behind his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lips after
that simple negative: Not yet.
Wendy relaxed a little more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) put a hand on Danny's jeans-clad leg and

<p/>squeezed it. <div class="bookquote">``Your daddy has tried very hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said softly. <div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>)
loves us. And we love him (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>), don't we?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) nodded gravely.
Speaking almost to herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) went on: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>)'s not a perfect man, but he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) has
tried ... Danny, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s tried so hard! When he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ... stopped ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went
through a kind of hell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s still going through it. I think if it hadn't been
for us, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would have just let go. I want to do what's right. And I don't know.
Should we go? Stay? It's like a choice between the fat and the fire.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Would you do something for me, doc?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Try to make Tony come. Right now. Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) if we're safe at the Overlook.''

tears.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, alarmed. <div class="bookquote">``Honey, don't do that. Please

across the double yellow line and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) pulled it back, scared.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't take me to Gramma's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said through his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tears. <div class="bookquote">``Please, Mommy, I

IN THE PLAYGROUND
Jack came out onto the porch, tugging the tab of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) zipper up under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) chin,
blinking into the bright air. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) left hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was holding a battery-powered
hedge-clipper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) tugged a fresh handkerchief out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) back pocket with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
right hand, wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) lips with it, and tucked it away. Snow, they had said on
the radio. It was hard to believe, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) could see the clouds building
up on the far horizon.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) started down the path to the topiary, switching the hedge-clipper over to
the other hand. It wouldn't be a long job, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) thought; a little touch-up would
do it. The cold nights had surely stunted their growth. The rabbit's ears looked
a little fuzzy, and two of the dog's legs had grown fuzzy green bonespurs, but

<p/>the lions and the buffalo looked fine. Just a little haircut would do the trick,
and then let the snow come.
The concrete path ended as abruptly as a diving board. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) stepped off it and
walked past the drained pool to the gravel path which wound through the hedge
sculptures and into the playground itself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) walked over to the rabbit and
pushed the button on the handle of the clippers. It hummed into quiet life.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi, Br`er Rabbit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``How are you today? A little off the top and
get some of the extra off your ears? Fine. Say, did you hear the one about the
traveling salesman and the old lady with a pet poodle?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) voice sounded unnatural and stupid in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ears, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stopped. It
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) didn't care much for these hedge animals. It had always
seemed slightly perverted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to clip and torture a plain old hedge into
something that it wasn't. Along one of the highways in Vermont there had been a
hedge billboard on a high slope overlooking the road, advertising some kind of
ice cream. Making nature peddle ice cream, that was just wrong. It was
grotesque.
-LRB-You weren't hired to philosophize, Torrance.-RRB-
Ah, that was true. So true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) clipped along the rabbit's ears, brushing a
small litter of sticks and twigs off onto the grass. The hedge-clipper hummed in
that low and rather disgustingly metallic way that all battery-powered
appliances seem to have. The sun was brilliant but it held no warmth, and now it
wasn't so hard to believe that snow was coming.
Working quickly, knowing that to stop and think when you were at this kind of
a task usually meant making a mistake, Jack touched up the rabbit's <div class="bookquote">``face''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>-LRB-up
this close it didn't look like a face at all, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knew that at a distance of
twenty paces or so light and shadow would seem to suggest one; that, and the
viewer's imagination-RRB- and then zipped the clippers along its belly.
That done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shut the clippers off, walked down toward the playground, and
then turned back abruptly to get it all at once, the entire rabbit. Yes, it
looked all right. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would do the dog next.
<div class="bookquote">``But if it was my hotel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'd cut the whole damn bunch of you down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would, too. Just cut them down and resod the lawn where they'd been and put
in half a dozen small metal tables with gaily colored umbrellas. People could
have cocktails on the Overlook's lawn in the summer sun. Sloe gin fizzes and
margaritas and pink ladies and all those sweet tourist drinks. A rum and tonic,
maybe. Jack took his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) handkerchief out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) back pocket and slowly rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
lips with it.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on, come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said softly. That was nothing to be thinking about.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was going to start back, and then some impulse made him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) change his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mind and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went down to the playground instead. It was funny how you never knew kids, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and Wendy had expected Danny would love the playground; it had
everything a kid could want. But Jack didn't think the boy had been down half a
dozen times, if that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) supposed if there had been another kid to play with, it
would have been different.
The gate squeaked slightly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) let himself in, and then there was crushed
gravel crunching under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went first to the playhouse, the perfect
scale model of the Overlook itself. It came up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) lower thigh, just about
Danny's height when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was standing up. Jack hunkered down and looked in the

<p/>third-floor windows.
<div class="bookquote">``The giant has come to eat you all up in your beds,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said hollowly. <div class="bookquote">``Kiss
your Triple A rating goodbye.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But that wasn't funny, either. You could open the
house simply by pulling it apart -- it opened on a hidden hinge. The inside was a
disappointment. The walls were painted, but the place was mostly hollow. But of
course it would have to be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) told himself, or how else could the kids get
inside? What play furniture might go with the place in the summer was gone,
probably packed away in the equipment shed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) closed it up and heard the small
click as the latch closed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) walked over to the slide, set the hedge-clipper down, and after a glance
back at the driveway to make sure Wendy and Danny hadn't returned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) climbed to
the top and sat down. This was the big kids' slide, but the fit was still
uncomfortably tight for his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) grownup ass. How long had it been since he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been
on a slide? Twenty years? It didn't seem possible it could be that long, it
didn't feel that long, but it had to be that, or more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) old
man taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) to the park in Berlin when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been Danny's age, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had
done the whole bit
slide, swings, teeter-totters, everything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and the old man
would have a hotdog lunch and buy peanuts from the man with the cart afterward.
They would sit on a bench to eat them and dusky clouds of pigeons would flock
around their feet.
<div class="bookquote">``Goddam scavenger birds,''  (<font color='red'><b>dad</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dad would say, <div class="bookquote">``don't you feed them, Jacky.''  (<font color='red'><b>dad</b></font>)</div>But
they would both end up feeding them, and giggling at the way they ran after the
nuts, the greedy way they ran after the nuts. Jack didn't think the old man had
ever taken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brothers to the park. Jack had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) favorite, and even so
Jack had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) lumps when the old man was drunk, which was a lot of the
time. But Jack had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) for as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was able, long after the rest of
the family could only hate and fear him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pushed off with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands and went to the bottom, but the trip was
unsatisfying. The slide, unused, had too much friction and no really pleasant
speed could be built up. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ass was just too big. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) adult feet thumped
into the slight dip where thousands of children's feet had landed before him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
stood up, brushed at the seat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pants, and looked at the hedge-clipper. But
instead of going back to it he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went to the swings, which were also a
disappointment. The chains had built up rust since the close of the season, and
they squealed like things in pain. Jack promised himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would oil them in
the spring.
You better stop it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) advised himself. You're not a kid anymore. You don't
need this place to prove it.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went on to the cement rings
they were too small for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) passed
them up
and then to the security fence which marked the edge of the grounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
curled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fingers through the links and looked through, the sun crosshatching
shadow-lines on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face like a man behind bars. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) recognized the similarity
himself and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shook the chain link, put a harried expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face, and
whispered: <div class="bookquote">``Lemme outta here! Lemme outta here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But for the third time, not
funny. It was time to get back to work.
That was when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heard the sound behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) turned around quickly, frowning, embarrassed, wondering if someone had seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fooling around down here in kiddie country. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes ticked off the slides,

<p/>the opposing angles of the seesaws, the swings in which only the wind sat.
Beyond all that to the gate and the low fence that divided the playground from
the lawn and the topiary
the lions gathered protectively around the path, the
rabbit bent over as if to crop grass, the buffalo ready to charge, the crouching
dog. Beyond them, the putting green and the hotel itself. From here he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could
even see the raised lip of the roque court on the Overlook's western side.
Everything was just as it had been. So why had the flesh of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face and hands
begun to creep, and why had the hair along the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) neck begun to stand
up, as if the flesh back there had suddenly tightened?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) squinted up at the hotel again, but that was no answer. It simply stood
there, its windows dark, a tiny thread of smoke curling from the chimney, coming
from the banked fire in the lobby.
-LRB-Buster, you better get going or they're going to come back and wonder if you
were doing anything all the while.-RRB-
Sure, get going. Because the snow was coming and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buster</b></font>) had to get the damn hedges
trimmed. It was part of the agreement. Besides, they wouldn't dare
-LRB-Who wouldn't? What wouldn't? Dare do what?-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Buster</b></font>) began to walk back toward the hedge-clipper at the foot of the big kids'
slide, and the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buster</b></font>) feet crunching on the crushed stone seemed
abnormally loud. Now the flesh on his (<font color='blue'><b>Buster</b></font>) testicles had begun to creep too, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buster</b></font>)
buttocks felt hard and heavy, like stone.
-LRB-Jesus, what is this?-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) stopped by the hedge-clipper, but made no move to pick it up. Yes, there
was something different. In the topiary. And it was so simple, so easy to see,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) just wasn't picking it up. Come on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) scolded himself, you just trimmed
the fucking rabbit, so what's the
-LRB-that's it-RRB-
His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) breath stopped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) throat.
The rabbit was down on all fours, cropping grass. Its belly was against the
ground. But not ten minutes ago it had been up on its hind legs, of course it
had been, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) had trimmed its ears ... and its belly.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) eyes darted to the dog. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) had come down the path it had been sitting
up, as if begging for a sweet. Now it was crouched, head tilted, the clipped
wedge of mouth seeming to snarl silently. And the lions --
-LRB-oh no, baby, oh no, uh-uh, no way-RRB-
the lions were closer to the path. The two on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) right had subtly changed
positions, had drawn closer together. The tail of the one on the left now almost
jutted out over the path. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) had come past them and through the gate, that
lion had been on the right and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was quite sure its tail had been curled around
it.
They were no longer protecting the path; they were blocking it.
Jack put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hand suddenly over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes and then took it away. The picture
didn't change. A soft sigh, too quiet to be a groan, escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). In his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
drinking days he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had always been afraid of something like this happening. But
when you were a heavy drinker you called it the DTs -- good old Ray Milland in
Lost Weekend, seeing the bugs coming out of the walls.
What did you call it when you were cold sober?
The question was meant to be rhetorical, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) mind answered it

<p/>-LRB-you call it insanity-RRB-
nevertheless.
Staring at the hedge animals, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) realized something had changed while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) had
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) eyes. The dog had moved closer. No longer crouching, it seemed
to be in a running posture, haunches flexed, one front leg forward, the other
back. The hedge mouth yawned wider, the pruned sticks looked sharp and vicious.
And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) could see faint eye indentations in the greenery as well.
Looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>).
Why do they have to be trimmed? he (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) thought hysterically. They're perfect.
Another soft sound. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) involuntarily backed up a step when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>) looked at the
lions. One of the two on the right seemed to have drawn slightly ahead of the
other. Its head was lowered. One paw had stolen almost all the way to the low
fence. Dear God, what next?
-LRB-next it leaps over and gobbles you up like something in an evil nursery
fable-RRB-
It was like that game they had played when they were kids, red light. One
person was <div class="bookquote">``it,''  (<font color='red'><b>person</b></font>)</div>and while he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) back and counted to ten, the other
players crept forward. When <div class="bookquote">``it''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>got to ten, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) whirled around and if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) caught
anyone moving, they were out of the game. The others remained frozen in statue
postures until <div class="bookquote">``it''  (<font color='red'><b>The others</b></font>)</div>turned his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) back and counted again. They got closer and
closer, and at last, somewhere between five and ten, you would feel a hand on
your back...
Gravel rattled on the path.
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) jerked his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head around to look at the dog and it was halfway down the
pathway, just behind the lions now, its mouth wide and yawning. Before, it had
only been a hedge clipped in the general shape of a dog, something that lost all
definition when you got up close to it. But now Jack could see that it had been
clipped to look like a German shepherd, and shepherds could be mean. You could
train shepherds to kill.
A low rustling sound.
The lion on the left had advanced all the way to the fence now; its muzzle was
touching the boards. It seemed to be grinning at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). Jack backed up another two
steps. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head was thudding crazily and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could feel the dry rasp of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
breath in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) throat. Now the buffalo had moved, circling to the right, behind
and around the rabbit. The head was lowered, the green hedge horns pointing at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). The thing was, you couldn't watch all of them. Not all at once.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) began to make a whining sound, unaware in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) locked concentration that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
was making any sound at all. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes darted from one hedge creature to the
next, trying to see them move. The wind gusted, making a hungry rattling sound
in the close-matted branches. What kind of sound would there be if they got him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)?
But of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knew. A snapping, rending, breaking sound. It would be
-LRB-no no NO NO I WILL NOT BELIEVE THIS NOT AT ALL!-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes, clutching at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) forehead, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
throbbing temples. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stood like that for a long time, dread building until
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could stand it no longer and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands away with a cry.
By the putting green the dog was sitting up, as if begging for a scrap. The
buffalo was gazing with disinterest back toward the roque court, as it had been
when Jack had come down with the clippers. The rabbit stood on its hind legs,

<p/>ears up to catch the faintest sound, freshly clipped belly exposed. The lions,
rooted into place, stood beside the path.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stood frozen for a long time, the harsh breath in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) throat finally
slowing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) reached for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) cigarettes and shook four of them out onto the
gravel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stooped down and picked them up, groped for them, never taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
eyes from the topiary for fear the animals would begin to move again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) picked
them up, stuffed three carelessly back into the pack, and lit the fourth. After
two deep drags he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) dropped it and crushed it out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went to the hedge-clipper
and picked it up.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm very tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>be said, and now it seemed okay to talk out loud. It didn't
seem crazy at all. <div class="bookquote">``I've been under a strain. The wasps ... the play ... Al
calling me like that. But it's all right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) began to trudge back up to the hotel. Part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mind tugged fretfully at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), tried to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) detour around the hedge animals, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went directly up
the gravel path, through them. A faint breeze rattled through them, that was
all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had imagined the whole thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had had a bad scare but it was over
now.
In the Overlook's kitchen he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) paused to take two Excedrin and then went
downstairs and looked at papers until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heard the dim sound of the hotel truck
rattling into the driveway. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went up to meet them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) felt all right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) saw
no need to mention his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hallucination. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'d had a bad scare but it was over now.

<p/><< 24 >>
SNOW
It was dusk.
They stood on the porch in the fading light, Jack in the middle, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) left arm
around Danny's shoulders and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) right arm around Wendy's waist. Together they
watched as the decision was taken out of their hands.
The sky had been completely clouded over by two-thirty and it had begun to
snow an hour later, and this time you didn't need a weatherman to tell you it
was serious snow, no flurry that was going to melt or blow away when the evening
wind started to whoop. At first it had fallen in perfectly straight lines,
building up a snowcover that coated everything evenly, but now, an hour after it
had started, the wind had begun to blow from the northwest and the snow had
begun to drift against the porch and the sides of the Overlook's driveway.
Beyond the grounds the highway had disappeared under an even blanket of white.
The hedge animals were also gone, but when Wendy and Danny had gotten home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
had commended him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) on the good job he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had done. Do you think so? he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had asked,
and said no more. Now the hedges were buried under amorphous white cloaks.
Curiously, all of them were thinking different thoughts but feeling the same

<p/>emotion: relief. The bridge had been crossed.
<div class="bookquote">``Will it ever be spring?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy murmured.
Jack squeezed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) tighter. <div class="bookquote">``Before you know it. What do you say we go in and
have some supper? It's cold out here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) smiled. All afternoon Jack had seemed distant and ... well, odd. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
sounded more like his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) normal self. <div class="bookquote">``Fine by me. How about you, Danny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the scream</b></font>)</div>So they went in together, leaving the wind to build to the low-pitched scream
that would go on all night
a sound they would get to know well. Flakes of snow
swirled and danced across the porch. The Overlook faced it as it had for nearly
three quarters of a century, its darkened windows now bearded with snow,
indifferent to the fact that it was now cut off from the world. Or possibly it
was pleased with the prospect. Inside its shell the three of them went about
their early evening routine, like microbes trapped in the intestine of a
monster.

<p/><< 25 >>
INSIDE 217
A week and a half later two feet of snow lay white and crisp and even on the
grounds of the Overlook Hotel. The hedge menagerie was buried up to its
haunches; the rabbit, frozen on its hind legs, seemed to be rising from a white
pool. Some of the drifts were over five feet deep. The wind was constantly
changing them, sculpting them into sinuous, dunelike shapes. Twice Jack had
snowshoed clumsily around to the equipment shed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shovel to clear the
porch, the third time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shrugged, simply cleared a path through the towering
drift lying against the door, and let Danny amuse himself by sledding to the
right and left of the path. The truly heroic drifts lay against the Overlook's
west side; some of them towered to a height of twenty feet, and beyond them the
ground was scoured bare to the grass by the constant windflow. The first-floor
windows were covered, and the view from the dining room which Jack had so
admired on closing day was now no more exciting than a view of a blank movie
screen. Their phone had been out for the last eight days, and the CB radio in
Ullman's office was now their only communications link with the outside world.
It snowed every day now, sometimes only brief flurries that powdered the
glittering snow crust, sometimes for real, the low whistle of the wind cranking
up to a womanish shriek that made the old hotel rock and groan alarmingly even
in its deep cradle of snow. Night temperatures had not gotten above 10°, and
although the thermometer by the kitchen service entrance sometimes got as high
as 25° in the early afternoons, the steady knife edge of the wind made it
uncomfortable to go out without a ski mask. But they all did go out on the days

<p/>when the sun shone, usually wearing two sets of clothing and mittens on over
their gloves. Getting out was almost a compulsive thing; the hotel was circled
with the double track of Danny's Flexible Flyer. The permutations were nearly
endless: Danny riding while his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) parents pulled; Daddy riding and laughing while
Wendy and Danny tried to pull -LRB-it was just possible for them to pull him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) on the
icy crust, and flatly impossible when powder covered it-RRB-; Danny and Mommy
riding; Wendy riding by herself while her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) menfolk pulled and puffed white vapor
like drayhorses, pretending she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was heavier than she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was. They laughed a great
deal on these sled excursions around the house, but the whooping and impersonal
voice of the wind, so huge and hollowly sincere, made their laughter seem tinny
and forced.
They had seen caribou tracks in the snow and once the caribou themselves, a
group of five standing motionlessly below the security fence. They had all taken
turns with Jack's Zeiss-Ikon binoculars to see them better, and looking at them
had given Wendy a weird, unreal feeling: they were standing leg-deep in the snow
that covered the highway, and it came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) that between now and the spring
thaw, the road belonged more to the caribou than it did to them. Now the things
that men had made up here were neutralized. The caribou understood that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
believed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had put the binoculars down and had said something about starting
lunch and in the kitchen she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had cried a little, trying to rid herself of the
awful pent-up feeling that sometimes fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) like a large, pressing hand
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought of the caribou. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought of the wasps Jack had
put out on the service entrance platform, under the Pyrex bowl, to freeze.
There were plenty of snowshoes hung from nails in the equipment shed, and Jack
found a pair to fit each of them, although Danny's pair was quite a bit
outsized. Jack did well with them. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had not snowshoed since his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
boyhood in Berlin, New Hampshire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) retaught himself quickly. Wendy didn't care
much for it -- even fifteen minutes of tramping around on the outsized laced
paddles made her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) legs and ankles ache outrageously
but Danny was intrigued and
working hard to pick up the knack. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) still fell often, but Jack was pleased
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) progress. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said that by February Danny would be skipping circles
around both of them.
***
This day was overcast, and by noon the sky had already begun to spit snow. The
radio was promising another eight to twelve inches and chanting hosannas to
Precipitation, that great god of Colorado skiers. Wendy, sitting in the bedroom
and knitting a scarf, thought to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knew exactly what the skiers
could do with all that snow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knew exactly where they could put it.
Jack was in the cellar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had gone down to check the furnace and boiler -- such
checks had become a ritual with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) since the snow had closed them in -- and after
satisfying himself that everything was going well he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had wandered through the
arch, screwed the lightbulb on, and had seated himself in an old and cobwebby
camp chair he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had found. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was leafing through the old records and papers,
constantly wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mouth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) handkerchief as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did so. Confinement had
leached his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) skin of its autumn tan, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) sat hunched over the yellowed,
crackling sheets, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) reddish-blond hair tumbling untidily over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) forehead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)

<p/>looked slightly lunatic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had found some odd things tucked in among the
invoices, bills of lading, receipts. Disquieting things. A bloody strip of
sheeting. A dismembered teddy bear that seemed to have been slashed to pieces. A
crumpled sheet of violet ladies' stationery, a ghost of perfume still clinging
to it beneath the musk of age, a note begun and left unfinished in faded blue
ink: <div class="bookquote">``Dearest Tommy, I can't think so well up here as I'd hoped, about us I
mean, of course, who else? Ha. Ha. Things keep getting in the way. I've had
strange dreams about things going bump in the night, can you believe that and''
 (<font color='red'><b>a ghost</b></font>)</div>That was all. The note was dated June 27, 1934. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) found a hand puppet that
seemed to be either a witch or a warlock ... something with long teeth and a
pointy hat, at any rate. It had been improbably tucked between a bundle of
natural-gas receipts and a bundle of receipts for Vichy water. And something
that seemed to be a poem, scribbled on the back of a menu in dark pencil:
<div class="bookquote">``Medoc/are you here?/I've been sleepwalking again, my dear./The plants are
moving under the rug.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No date on the menu, and no name on the poem, if it was a
poem. Elusive, but fascinating. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) that these things were like
pieces in a jigsaw, things that would eventually fit together if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could find
the right linking pieces. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) kept looking, jumping and wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) lips
every time the furnace roared into life behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).
***
Danny was standing outside Room 217 again.
The passkey was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was staring at the door with a kind of
drugged avidity, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) upper body seemed to twitch and jiggle beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
flannel shirt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was humming softly and tunelessly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hadn't wanted to come here, not after the fire hose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was scared to come
here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was scared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had taken the passkey again, disobeying his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had wanted to come here. Curiosity
-LRB-killed the cat; satisfaction brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) back-RRB-
was like a constant fishhook in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) brain, a kind of nagging siren song that
would not be appeased. And hadn't Mr. Hallorann said, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think there's
anything here that can hurt you'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>?
-LRB-You promised.-RRB-
-LRB-Promises were made to be broken.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) jumped at that. It was as if that thought had come from outside, insectile,
buzzing, softly cajoling.
-LRB-Promises were made to be broken my dear redrum, to be broken. splintered.
shattered. hammered apart. FORE!-RRB-
His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) nervous humming broke into low, atonal song: <div class="bookquote">``Lou, Lou, skip to m' Lou,
skip to m' Lou my daaarlin...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hadn't Mr. Hallorann been right? Hadn't that been, in the end, the reason why
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) had kept silent and allowed the snow to close them in?
Just close your eyes and it will be gone.
What he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) had seen in the Presidential Sweet had gone away. And the snake had
only been a fire hose that had fallen onto the rug. Yes, even the blood in the
Presidential Sweet had been harmless, something old, something that had happened
long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) was born or even thought of, something that was done with. Like a

<p/>movie that only he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) could see. There was nothing, really nothing, in this hotel
that could hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>), and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) had to prove that to himself by going into this
room, shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) do so?
<div class="bookquote">``Lou, Lou, skip to m`Lou ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>the cat</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Curiosity killed the cat my dear redrum, redrum my dear, satisfaction brought
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) back safe and sound, from toes to crown; from head to ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) was safe and
sound. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) knew that those things-RRB-
-LRB-are like scary pictures, they can't hurt you, but oh my god-RRB-
-LRB-what big teeth you have grandma and is that a wolf in a BLUEBEARD suit or a
BLUEBEARD in a wolf suit and i'm so-RRB-
-LRB-glad you asked because curiosity killed that cat and it was the HOPE of
satisfaction that brought him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>)-RRB-
up the hall, treading softly over the blue and twisting jungle carpet. He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) had
stopped by the fire extinguisher, had put the brass nozzle back in the frame,
and then had poked it repeatedly with his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) finger, heart thumping, whispering:
<div class="bookquote">``Come on and hurt me. Come on and hurt me, you cheap prick. Can't do it, can
you? Huh? You're nothing but a cheap fire hose. Can't do nothin but lie there.
Come on, come on!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) had felt insane with bravado. And nothing had happened. It
was only a hose after all, only canvas and brass, you could hack it to pieces
and it would never complain, never twist and jerk and bleed green slime all over
the blue carpet, because it was only a hose, not a nose and not a rose, not
glass buttons or satin bows, not a snake in a sleepy doze ... and he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) had
hurried on, had hurried on because he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) was
-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``late, I'm late,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the white rabbit.-RRB-
the white rabbit. Yes. Now there was a white rabbit out by the playground,
once it had been green but now it was white, as if something had shocked it
repeatedly on the snowy, windy nights and turned it old ...
Danny took the passkey from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pocket and slid it into the lock.
<div class="bookquote">``Lou, Lou ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>a croquet party</b></font>)</div>-LRB-the white rabbit had been on its way to a croquet party to the Red Queen's
croquet party storks for mallets hedgehogs for balls-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) touched the key, let his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fingers wander over it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head felt dry and
sick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) turned the key and the tumblers thumped back smoothly.
-LRB-OFF WITH HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) HEAD! OFF WITH HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) HEAD! OFF WITH HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) HEAD!-RRB-
-LRB-this game isn't croquet though the mallets are too short this game is-RRB-
-LRB-WHACK-BOOM! Straight through the wicket.-RRB-
-LRB-OFF WITH HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) HEEEEEAAAAAAAD ---RRB-
Danny pushed the door open. It swung smoothly, without a creak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was
standing just outside a large combination bedsitting room, and although the snow
had not reached up this far
the highest drifts were still a foot below the
second-floor windows
the room was dark because Daddy had closed all the shutters
on the western exposure two weeks ago.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stood in the doorway, fumbled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) right, and found the switch plate. Two
bulbs in an overhead cut-glass fixture came on. Danny stepped further in and
looked around. The rug was deep and soft, a quiet rose color. Soothing. A double
bed with a white coverlet. A writing desk
-LRB-Pray tell me: Why is a raven like a writing desk?-RRB-
by the large shuttered window. During the season the Constant Writer

<p/>-LRB-having a wonderful time, wish you were fear-RRB-
would have a pretty view of the mountains to describe to the folks back home.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Writer</b></font>) stepped further in. Nothing here, nothing at all. Only an empty room, cold
because Daddy was heating the east wing today. A bureau. A closet, its door open
to reveal a clutch of hotel hangers, the kind you can't steal. A Gideon Bible on
an endtable. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Gideon</b></font>) left was the bathroom door, a full-length mirror on it
reflecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gideon</b></font>) own white-faced image. That door was ajar and --
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gideon</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Gideon</b></font>) double nod slowly.
Yes, that's where it was, whatever it was. In there. In the bathroom. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gideon</b></font>)
double walked forward, as if to escape the glass. It put its hand out, pressed
it against his (<font color='blue'><b>Gideon</b></font>) own. Then it fell away at an angle as the bathroom door swung
open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gideon</b></font>) looked in.
A long room, old-fashioned, like a Pullman car. Tiny white hexagonal tiles on
the floor. At the far end, a toilet with the lid up. At the right, a washbasin
and another mirror above it, the kind that hides a medicine cabinet. To the
left, a huge white tub on claw feet, the shower curtain pulled closed. Danny
stepped into the bathroom and walked toward the tub dreamily, as if propelled
from outside himself, as if this whole thing were one of the dreams Tony had
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) would perhaps see something nice when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) pulled the shower
curtain back, something Daddy had forgotten or Mommy had lost, something that
would make them both happy --
So he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) pulled the shower curtain back.
The woman in the tub had been dead for a long time. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was bloated and
purple, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gas-filled belly rising out of the cold, ice-rimmed water like some
fleshy island. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes were fixed on Danny's, glassy and huge, like marbles.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was grinning, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) purple lips pulled back in a grimace. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breasts lolled.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pubic hair floated. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands were frozen on the knurled porcelain sides of
the tub like crab claws.
Danny shrieked. But the sound never escaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lips; turning inward and
inward, it fell down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) darkness like a stone in a well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) took a single
blundering step backward, hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) heels clack on the white hexagonal tiles,
and at the same moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) urine broke, spilling effortlessly out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).
The woman was sitting up.
Still grinning, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) huge marble eyes fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was sitting up. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
dead palms made squittering noises on the porcelain. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breasts swayed like
ancient cracked punching bags. There was the minute sound of breaking ice
shards. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not breathing. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a corpse, and dead long years.
Danny turned and ran. Bolting through the bathroom door, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes starting
from their sockets, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hair on end like the hair of a hedgehog about to be
turned into a sacrificial
-LRB-croquet? or roque?-RRB-
ball, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth open and soundless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ran full-tilt into the outside door of
217, which was now closed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) began hammering on it, far beyond realizing that
it was unlocked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had only to turn the knob to let himself out. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth
pealed forth deafening screams that were beyond human auditory range. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could
only hammer on the door and hear the dead woman coming for him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), bloated belly,
dry hair, outstretched hands
something that had lain slain in that tub for
perhaps years, embalmed there in magic.

<p/>The door would not open, would not, would not, would not.
And then the voice of Dick Hallorann came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>), so sudden and unexpected, so
calm, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) locked vocal cords opened and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) began to cry weakly
not with
fear but with blessed relief.
-LRB-I don't think they can hurt you ... they're like pictures in a book ...
close your eyes and they'll be gone.-RRB-
His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) eyelids snapped down. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) hands curled into balls. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) shoulders hunched
with the effort of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) concentration:
-LRB-Nothing there nothing there not there at all NOTHING
THERE THERE IS NOTHING!-RRB-
Time passed. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) was just beginning to relax, just beginning to realize
that the door must be unlocked and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) could go, when the years-damp, bloated,
fish-smelling hands closed softly around his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) throat and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) was turned implacably
around to stare into that dead and purple face.

DREAMLAND
Knitting made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) sleepy. Today even Bartok would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) sleepy, and it
wasn't Bartok on the little phonograph, it was Bach. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) hands grew slower and
slower, and at the time her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) son was making the acquaintance of Room 217's longterm resident, Wendy was asleep with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knitting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lap. The yarn and
needles rose in the slow time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breathing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sleep was deep and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) did
not dream.

<p/>***
Jack Torrance had fallen asleep too, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) sleep was light and uneasy,
populated by dreams that seemed too vivid to be mere dreams -- they were certainly
more vivid than any dreams he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had ever had before.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) eyes had begun to get heavy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) leafed through packets of milk bills, a
hundred to a packet, seemingly tens of thousands all together. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) gave each
one a cursory glance, afraid that by not being thorough he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) might miss exactly
the piece of Overlookiana he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) needed to make the mystic connection that he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) was
sure must be here somewhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) felt like a man with a power cord in one hand,
groping around a dark and unfamiliar room for a socket. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) could find it he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>)
would be rewarded with a view of wonders.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had come to grips with Al Shockley's phone call and his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) request; his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>)
strange experience in the playground had helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) to do that. That had been
too damned close to some kind of breakdown, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) was convinced that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>)
mind in revolt against Al's high-goddam-handed request that he (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) chuck his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) book
project. It had maybe been a signal that his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) own sense of self-respect could
only be pushed so far before disintegrating entirely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) would write the book.
If it meant the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) association with Al Shockley, that would have to be.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) would write the hotel's biography, write it straight from the shoulder, and
the introduction would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) hallucination that the topiary animals had moved.
The title would be uninspired but workable: Strange Resort, The Story of the
Overlook Hotel. Straight from the shoulder, yes, but it would not be written
vindictively, in any effort to get back at Al or Stuart Ullman or George
Hatfield or his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) father -LRB-miserable, bullying drunk that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) had been-RRB- or anyone
else, for that matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) would write it because the Overlook had enchanted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) -- could any other explanation be so simple or so true? He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) would write it for
the reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) felt that all great literature, fiction and nonfiction, was
written: truth comes out, in the end it always comes out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) would write it
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) had to.
Five hundred gals whole milk. One hundred gals skim milk. Pd. Billed to acc`t.
Three hundred pts orange juice. Pd.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) slipped down further in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) chair, still holding a clutch of the receipts,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) eyes no longer looking at what was printed there. They had come
unfocused. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) lids were slow and heavy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) mind had slipped from the Overlook
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) father, who had been a male nurse at the Berlin Community Hospital. Big
man. A fat man who had towered to six feet two inches, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been taller than
Jack even when Jack got his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) full growth of six feet even -- not that the old man
had still been around then. <div class="bookquote">``Runt of the litter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would say, and then cuff
Jack lovingly and laugh. There had been two other brothers, both taller than
their father, and Becky, who at five-ten had only been two inches shorter than
Jack and taller than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) for most of their childhood.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) relationship with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) father had been like the unfurling of some flower of
beautiful potential, which, when wholly opened, turned out to be blighted
inside. Until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been seven he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had loved the tall, big-bellied man
uncritically and strongly in spite of the spankings, the black-and-blues, the
occasional black eye.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could remember velvet summer nights, the house quiet, oldest brother Brett

<p/>out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) girl, middle brother Mike studying something, Becky and their
mother in the living room, watching something on the balky old TV; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) would
sit in the hall dressed in a pajama singlet and nothing else, ostensibly playing
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) trucks, actually waiting for the moment when the silence would be
broken by the door swinging open with a large bang, the bellow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) father's
welcome when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) saw Jacky was waiting, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) own happy squeal in answer as this
big man came down the hall, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) pink scalp glowing beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) crewcut in the
glow of the hall light. In that light he (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) always looked like some soft and
flapping oversized ghost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) hospital whites, the shirt always untucked -LRB-and
sometimes bloody-RRB-, the pants cuffs drooping down over the black shoes.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) father would sweep him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arms and Jacky would be propelled
deliriously upward, so fast it seemed he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could feel air pressure settling
against his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) skull like a cap made out of lead, up and up, both of them crying
<div class="bookquote">``Elevator! Elevator!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and there had been nights when his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
drunkenness had not stopped the upward lift of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) slabmuscled arms soon enough
and Jacky had gone right over his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father's flattopped head like a human
projectile to crash-land on the hall floor behind his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dad. But on other nights
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father would only sweep him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) into a giggling ecstasy, through the zone of air
where beer hung around his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father's face like a mist of raindrops, to be twisted
and turned and shaken like a laughing rag, and finally to be set down on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
feet, hiccupping with reaction.
The receipts slipped from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) relaxing hand and seesawed down through the air
to land lazily on the floor; his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyelids, which had settled shut with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
father's image tattooed on their backs like stereopticon images, opened a little
bit and then slipped back down again. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) twitched a little. Consciousness, like
the receipts, like autumn aspen leaves, seesawed lazily downward.
That had been the first phase of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) relationship with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father, and as it
was drawing to its end he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had become aware that Becky and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brothers, all of
them older, hated the father and that their mother, a nondescript woman who
rarely spoke above a mutter, only suffered him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) because her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) Catholic upbringing
said that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must. In those days it had not seemed strange to Jack that the
father won all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arguments with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) children by use of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fists, and it had
not seemed strange that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own love should go hand-in-hand with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fear: fear
of the elevator game which might end in a splintering crash on any given night;
fear that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father's bearish good humor on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) day off might suddenly change
to boarish bellowing and the smack of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``good right hand'' (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>; and sometimes, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
remembered, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had even been afraid that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father's shadow might fall over him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was at play. It was near the end of this phase that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) began to notice
that Brett never brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) dates home, or Mike and Becky their chums.
Love began to curdle at nine, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) father put his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother into the hospital
with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cane. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had begun to carry the cane a year earlier, when a car
accident had left him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lame. After that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was never without it, long and black
and thick and gold-headed. Now, dozing, Jack's body twitched in a remembered
cringe at the sound it made in the air, a murderous swish, and its heavy crack
against the wall ... or against flesh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had beaten their mother for no good
reason at all, suddenly and without warning. They had been at the supper table.
The cane had been standing by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) chair. It was a Sunday night, the end of a
three-day weekend for Daddy, a weekend which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had boozed away in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) usual

<p/>inimitable style. Roast chicken. Peas. Mashed potatoes. Daddy at the head of the
table, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) plate heaped high, snoozing or nearly snoozing. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mother passing
plates. And suddenly Daddy had been wide awake, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes set deeply into their
fat eyesockets, glittering with a kind of stupid, evil petulance. They flickered
from one member of the family to the next, and the vein in the center of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>)
forehead was standing out prominently, always a bad sign. One of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) large
freckled hands had dropped to the gold knob of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) cane, caressing it. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) said
something about coffee ¯ to this day Jack was sure it had been <div class="bookquote">``coffee''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
father said. Momma had opened her (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) mouth to answer and then the cane was
whickering through the air, smashing against her (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) face. Blood spurted from her (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>)
nose. Becky screamed. Momma's spectacles dropped into her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) gravy. The cane had
been drawn back, had come down again, this time on top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) head, splitting
the scalp. Momma had dropped to the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been out of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chair and
around to where she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) lay dazed on the carpet, brandishing the cane, moving with a
fat man's grotesque speed and agility, little eyes flashing, jowls quivering as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had always spoken to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children during such
outbursts. <div class="bookquote">``Now. Now by Christ. I guess you'll take your medicine now. Goddam
puppy. Whelp. Come on and take your medicine.''  (<font color='red'><b>Brett</b></font>)</div>The cane had gone up and down on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) seven more times before Brett and Mike got hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>), dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) away,
wrestled the cane out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) hand. Jack
-LRB-little Jacky now he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was little Jacky now dozing and mumbling on a cobwebby
camp chair while the furnace roared into hollow life behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)-RRB-
knew exactly how many blows it had been because each soft whump against his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
mother's body had been engraved on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) memory like the irrational swipe of a
chisel on stone. Seven whumps. No more, no less. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and Becky crying,
unbelieving, looking at their mother's spectacles lying in her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) mashed potatoes,
one cracked lens smeared with gravy. Brett shouting at Daddy from the back hall,
telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>)'d kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) moved. And Daddy saying over and over: <div class="bookquote">``Damn
little puppy. Damn little whelp. Give me my cane, you damn little pup. Give it
to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Brett</b></font>)</div>Brett brandishing it hysterically, saying yes, yes, I'll give it to you,
just you move a little bit and I'll give you all you want and two extra. I'll
give you plenty. Momma getting slowly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) feet, dazed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) face already
puffed and swelling like an old tire with too much air in it, bleeding in four
or five different places, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had said a terrible thing, perhaps the only
thing Momma had ever said which Jacky could recall word for word: <div class="bookquote">``Who's got the
newspaper? Your daddy wants the funnies. Is it raining yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacky</b></font>)</div>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) sank
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) knees again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) hair hanging in her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) puffed and bleeding face. Mike
calling the doctor, babbling into the phone. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) come right away? It was
their mother. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) couldn't say what the trouble was, not over the phone, not
over a party line he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) couldn't. Just come. The doctor came and took Momma away to
the hospital where Daddy had worked all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) adult life. Daddy, sobered up
some -LRB-or perhaps only with the stupid cunning of any hardpressed animal-RRB-, told
the doctor she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had fallen downstairs. There was blood on the tablecloth because
he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had tried to wipe her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dear face with it. Had her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) glasses flown all the way
through the living room and into the dining room to land in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mashed potatoes
and gravy? the doctor asked with a kind of horrid, grinning sarcasm. Is that
what happened, Mark? I have heard of folks who can get a radio station on their
gold fillings and I have seen a man get shot between the eyes and live to tell

<p/>about it, but that is a new one on me. Daddy had merely shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head and said
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't know; they must have fallen off her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) through
the dining room. The four children had been stunned to silence by the calm
stupendousness of the lie. Four days later Brett quit his (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) job in the mill and
joined the Army. Jack had always felt it was not just the sudden and irrational
beating his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) father had administered at the dinner table but the fact that, in
the hospital, their mother had corroborated their father's story while holding
the hand of the parish priest. Revolted, Brett had left them to whatever might
come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) had been killed in Dong Ho province in 1965, the year when Jack
Torrance, undergraduate, had joined the active college agitation to end the war.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) brother's bloody shirt at rallies that were increasingly well
attended, but it was not Brett's face that hung before his (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) eyes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) spoke
it
was the face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) mother, a dazed, uncomprehending face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) mother saying:
<div class="bookquote">``Who's got the newspaper?''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Mike escaped three years later when Jack was twelve
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went to UNH on a hefty
Merit Scholarship. A year after that their father died of a sudden, massive
stroke which occurred while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was prepping a patient for surgery. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
collapsed in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) flapping and untucked hospital whites, dead possibly even
before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hit the industrial black-and-red hospital tiles, and three days later
the man who had dominated Jacky's life, the irrational white ghost-god, was
under ground.
The stone read Mark Anthony Torrance, Loving Father. To that Jack would have
added one line: He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) Knew How to Play Elevator.
There had been a great lot of insurance money. There are people who collect
insurance as compulsively as others collect coins and stamps, and Mark Torrance
had been that type. The insurance money came in at the same time the monthly
policy payments and liquor bills stopped. For five years they had been rich.
Nearly rich ...
In his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) shallow, uneasy sleep his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) face rose before him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) as if in a glass, his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>)
face but not his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) face, the wide eyes and innocent bowed mouth of a boy sitting
in the ball with his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) trucks, waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) daddy, waiting for the white ghostgod, waiting for the elevator to rise up with dizzying, exhilarating speed
through the salt-and-sawdust mist of exhaled taverns, waiting perhaps for it to
go crashing down, spilling old clocksprings out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) ears while his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) daddy
roared with laughter, and it
-LRB-transformed into Danny's face, so much like his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) own had been, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes had
been light blue while Danny's were cloudy gray, but the lips still made a bow
and the complexion was fair; Danny in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) study, wearing training pants, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
papers soggy and the fine misty smell of beer rising ... a dreadful batter all
in ferment, rising on the wings of yeast, the breath of taverns ... snap of
bone ... his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) own voice, mewling drunkenly Danny, you okay doc? ... Oh God oh
God your poor sweet arm ... and that face transformed into-RRB-
-LRB-momma's dazed face rising up from below the table, punched and bleeding, and
momma was saying-RRB-
-LRB-<div class="bookquote">'' -- from your father. I repeat, an enormously important announcement from your
father. Please stay tuned or tune immediately to the Happy Jack frequency.

A slow dissolve. Disembodied voices echoing up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) as if along an endless,

<p/>cloudy hallway.

-LRB-Medoc, are you here? I've been sleepwalking again, my dear. It's the inhuman

and the big two-way radio on its shelf.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) snapped it on. CB transmissions coming in short, crackly bursts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)
switched the band and dialed across bursts of music, news, a preacher haranguing
a softly moaning congregation, a weather report. And another voice which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)
dialed back to. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) father's voice.
<div class="bookquote">'' -- kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>). You have to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>), Jacky, and her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), too. Because a real artist

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's voice, going up higher and higher, becoming something maddening,
not human at all, something squealing and petulant and maddening, the voice of
the Ghost-God, the Pig-God, coming dead at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of the radio and
<div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) screamed back. <div class="bookquote">``You're dead, you're in your grave, you're not in me

England town where his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father had lived and died.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) raised the radio up and brought it down, and it smashed on the floor
spilling old clocksprings and tubes like the result of some crazy elevator game
gone awry, making his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's voice gone, leaving only his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice, Jack's voice,
Jacky's voice, chanting in the cold reality of the office:
<div class="bookquote">'' -- dead, you're dead, you're dead!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jacky</b></font>)</div>And the startled sound of Wendy's feet hitting the floor over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and
Wendy's startled, frightened voice: <div class="bookquote">``Jack? Jack!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood, blinking down at the shattered radio. Now there was only the
snowmobile in the equipment shed to link them to the outside world.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes and clutched at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) temples. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was getting a
headache.

<p/><< 27 >>

<p/>CATATONIC
Wendy ran down the hall in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stocking feet and ran down the main stairs to
the lobby two at a time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) didn't look up at the carpeted flight that led to
the second floor, but if she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would have seen Danny standing at the top
of them, still and silent, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) unfocused eyes directed out into indifferent
space, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thumb in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth, the collar and shoulders of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shirt damp. There
were puffy bruises on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) neck and just below his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) chin.
Jack's cries had ceased, but that did nothing to ease her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fear. Ripped out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sleep by his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) voice, raised in that old hectoring pitch she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) remembered so
well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) still felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was dreaming -- but another part knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was awake,
and that terrified her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) half-expected to burst into the office and find
him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) standing over Danny's sprawled-out body, drunk and confused.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) pushed through the door and Jack was standing there, rubbing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
temples with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fingers. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face was ghostwhite. The two-way CB radio lay at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) feet in a sprinkling of broken glass.
<div class="bookquote">``Wendy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) asked uncertainly. <div class="bookquote">``Wendy -- ?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The bewilderment seemed to grow and for a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) true face, the
one he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ordinarily kept so well hidden, and it was a face of desperate
unhappiness, the face of an animal caught in a snare beyond its ability to
decipher and render harmless. Then the muscles began to work, began to writhe
under the skin, the mouth began to tremble infirmly, the Adam's apple began to
rise and fall.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) own bewilderment and surprise were overlaid by shock: he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was going to cry.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) cry before, but never since he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) stopped drinking ... and never
in those days unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was very drunk and pathetically remorseful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was a
tight man, drum-tight, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) loss of control frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) all over again.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) came toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), the tears brimming over his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) lower lids now, his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) head
shaking involuntarily as if in a fruitless effort to ward off this emotional
storm, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) chest drew in a convulsive gasp that was expelled in a huge,
racking sob. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) feet, clad in Hush Puppies, stumbled over the wreck of the
radio and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) almost fell into her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arms, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stagger back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) weight.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) breath blew into her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face and there was no smell of liquor on it. Of course
not; there was no liquor up here.
<div class="bookquote">``What's wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) held him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) as best she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could. <div class="bookquote">``Jack, what is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could do nothing at first but sob, clinging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), almost crushing the
wind from her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) head turning on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shoulder in that helpless, shaking,
warding-off gesture. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) sobs were heavy and fierce. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was shuddering all over,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) muscles jerking beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) plaid shirt and jeans.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack? What? Tell me what's wrong!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>At last the sobs began to change themselves into words, most of them
incoherent at first, but coming clearer as his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) tears began to spend themselves.
''... dream, I guess it was a dream, but it was so real, I...
it was my mother saying that Daddy was going to be on the radio and I ...

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) was ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) was telling me to ... I don't know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) was yelling at me ...
and so I broke the radio ... to shut him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) up. To shut him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>)'s dead. I
don't even want to dream about him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>)'s dead. My God, Wendy, my God. I never
had a nightmare like that. I never want to have another one. Christ! It was
awful.''
``You just fell asleep in the office?''
``No ... not here. Downstairs.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was straightening a little now, his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) weight
coming off her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), and the steady back-and-forth motion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) head first slowed and
then stopped.
``I was looking through those old papers. Sitting on a chair I set up down
there. Milk receipts. Dull stuff. And I guess I just drowsed off. That's when I
started to dream. I must have sleepwalked up here.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) essayed a shaky little
laugh against her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) neck. ``Another first.''
``Where is Danny, Jack?''
``I don't know. Isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) with you?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wasn't ... downstairs with you?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) shoulder and his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) face tightened at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) saw on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face.
``Never going to let me forget that, are you, Wendy?''
``Jack -- ''
``When I'm on my deathbed you'll lean over and say, `It serves you right,
remember the time you broke Danny's arm?' ''
``Jack!''
``Jack what?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) asked hotly, and jumped to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) feet. ``Are you denying that's
what you're thinking? That I hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)? That I hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) once before and I could
hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) again?''
``I want to know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is, that's all!''
``Go ahead, yell your fucking head off, that'll make everything okay, won't it? ''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) turned and walked out the door.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) go, frozen for a moment, a blotter covered with fragments of
broken glass in one hand. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) dropped it into the wastebasket, went after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), and caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) by the lobby desk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shoulders and
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) around. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face was carefully set.
``Wendy, I'm sorry. It was the dream. I'm upset. Forgive?''
``Of course,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face not changing expression. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wooden shoulders
slipped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) walked to the middle of the lobby and called:
``Hey, doc! Where are you?''
Silence came back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) walked toward the double lobby doors, opened one of
them, and stepped out onto the path Jack had shoveled. It was more like a
trench; the packed and drifted snow through which the path was cut came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
shoulders. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breath coming out in a white plume. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) came back in she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had begun to look scared.
Controlling his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) irritation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said reasonably: ``Are you sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s
not sleeping in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) room?''
``I told you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was playing somewhere when I was knitting. I could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
downstairs.''
``Did you fall asleep?''
``What's that got to do with it? Yes. Danny?''
<div class="bookquote">``Did you look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) room when you came downstairs just now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>``I -- ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stopped.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) nodded. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't really think so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) started up the stairs without waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), halfrunning, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was taking the risers two at a time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) almost crashed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
back when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) came to a dead stop on the first-floor landing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was rooted
there, looking up, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes wide.
<div class="bookquote">``What -- ?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) began, and followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) gaze.
Danny still stood there, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes blank, sucking his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thumb. The marks on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
throat were cruelly visible in the light of the hall's electric flambeaux.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shrieked.
It broke Jack's paralysis and they rushed up the stairs together to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
stood. Wendy fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knees beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and swept the boy into her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arms. Danny
came pliantly enough, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) did not hug her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) back. It was like hugging a padded
stick, and the sweet taste of horror flooded her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) only sucked his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thumb
and stared with indifferent blankness out into the stairwell beyond both of
them.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny, what happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hand to touch the puffy
side of Danny's neck. <div class="bookquote">``Who did this to -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't you touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy hissed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) clutched Danny in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arms, lifted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), and had retreated halfway down the stairs before Jack could do more than
stand up, confused.
<div class="bookquote">``What? Wendy, what the hell are you t -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't you touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)! I'll kill you if you lay your hands on him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) again!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wendy -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You bastard!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) turned and ran down the rest of the stairs to the first floor. Danny's
head jounced mildly up and down as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ran. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thumb was lodged securely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
mouth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes were soaped windows. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) turned right at the foot of the stairs,
and Jack heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) feet retreat to the end of it. Their bedroom door slammed.
The bolt was run home. The lock turned. Brief silence. Then the soft, muttered
sounds of comforting.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stood for an unknown length of time, literally paralyzed by all that had
happened in such a short space of time. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) dream was still with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), painting
everything a slightly unreal shade. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had taken a very mild
mescaline hit. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) maybe hurt Danny as Wendy thought? Tried to strangle his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
son at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) dead father's request? No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would never hurt Danny.
-LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fell down the stairs, Doctor.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would never hurt Danny now.
-LRB-How could I know the bug bomb was defective?-RRB-
Never in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) life had he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) been willfully vicious when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was sober.
-LRB-Except when you almost killed George Hatfield.-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) cried into the darkness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) brought both fists crashing down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>)
legs, again and again and again.
***
Wendy sat in the overstuffed chair by the window with Danny on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lap,
holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), crooning the old meaningless words, the ones you never remember

<p/>afterward no matter how a thing turns out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had folded onto her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lap with
neither protest nor gladness, like a paper cutout of himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes
didn't even shift toward the door when Jack cried out <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>somewhere in the
hallway.
The confusion had receded a little bit in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mind, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) now discovered
something even worse behind it. Panic.
Jack had done this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had no doubt of it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) denials meant nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought it was perfectly possible that Jack had tried to throttle Danny in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sleep just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had smashed the CB radio in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was having a
breakdown of some kind. But what was she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) going to do about it? She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) couldn't stay
locked in here forever. They would have to eat.
There was really only one question, and it was asked in a mental voice of
utter coldness and pragmatism, the voice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) maternity, a cold and
passionless voice once it was directed away from the closed circle of mother and
child and out toward Jack. It was a voice that spoke of self-preservation only
after son-preservation and its question was:
-LRB-Exactly how dangerous is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)?-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had denied doing it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been horrified at the bruises, at Danny's soft
and implacable disconnection. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had done it, a separate section of himself
had been responsible. The fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had done it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was asleep was
in a
terrible, twisted way
encouraging. Wasn't it possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could be trusted
to get them out of here? To get them down and away. And after that ...
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could see no further than she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and Danny arriving safe at Dr. Edmonds's
office in Sidewinder. She (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had no particular need to see further. The present
crisis was more than enough to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) occupied.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) crooned to Danny, rocking him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) breasts. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fingers, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
shoulder, had noticed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) T-shirt was damp, but they had not bothered
reporting the information to her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) brain in more than a cursory way. If it had
been reported, she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) might have remembered that Jack's hands, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
in the office and sobbed against her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) neck, bad been dry. It might have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
pause. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind was still on other things. The decision had to be made -- to
approach Jack or not?
Actually it was not much of a decision. There was nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could do alone,
not even carry Danny down to the office and call for help on the CB radio. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
had suffered a great shock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ought to be taken out quickly before any
permanent damage could be done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) refused to let herself believe that
permanent damage might already have been done.
And still she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) agonized over it, looking for another alternative. She (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) did not
want to put Danny back within Jack's reach. She (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was aware now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had made
one bad decision when she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had gone against her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) feelings -LRB-and Danny's-RRB- and
allowed the snow to close them in ... for Jack's sake. Another bad decision
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had shelved the idea of divorce. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was nearly paralyzed by the
idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) might be making another mistake, one she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would regret every minute
of every day of the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) life.
There was not a gun in the place. There were knives hanging from the
magnetized runners in the kitchen, but Jack was between her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and them.
In her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) striving to make the right decision, to find the alternative, the
bitter irony of her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thoughts did not occur: an hour ago she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been asleep,

<p/>firmly convinced that things were all right and soon would be even better. Now
she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was considering the possibility of using a butcher knife on her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) husband if
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tried to interfere with her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) son.
At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stood up with Danny in her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) arms, her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) legs trembling. There was no
other way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would have to assume that Jack awake was Jack sane, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
would help her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) get Danny down to Sidewinder and Dr. Edmonds. And if Jack tried
to do anything but help, God help him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went to the door and unlocked it. Shifting Danny up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shoulder, she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
opened it and went out into the hall.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) called nervously, and got no answer.
With growing trepidation she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) walked down to the stairwell, but Jack was not
there. And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stood there on the landing, wondering what to do next, the
singing came up from below, rich, angry, bitterly satiric:
<div class="bookquote">``Roll me over
In the clo-ho-ver,
Roll me over, lay me down and do it again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was frightened even more by the sound of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
silence, but there was still no alternative. She (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) started down the stairs.

<p/><< 28 >>
<div class="bookquote">``IT WAS HER!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack had stood on the stairs, listening to the crooning, comforting sounds
coming muffled through the locked door, and slowly his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) confusion had given way
to anger. Things had never really changed. Not to Wendy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could be off the
juice for twenty years and still when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) came home at night and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
at the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would see/ sense that little flare of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) nostrils as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) tried
to divine scotch or gin fumes riding the outbound train of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) exhalation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
was always going to assume the worst; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and Danny got in a car accident with
a drunken blindman who had had a stroke just before the collision, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would
silently blame Danny's injuries on him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and turn away.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had snatched Danny away
it rose up before him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) suddenly
wanted to wipe the anger that had been on it out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fist.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had no goddam right!
Yes, maybe at first. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been a lush, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had done terrible things. Breaking
Danny's arm had been a terrible thing. But if a man reforms, doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) deserve
to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) reformation credited sooner or later? And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) doesn't get it,
doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) deserve the game to go with the name? If a father constantly accuses
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) virginal daughter of screwing every boy in junior high, must she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) not at last

<p/>grow weary -LRB-enough-RRB- of it to earn her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) scoldings? And if a wife secretly-and not
so secretly-continues to believe that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) teetotaling husband is a drunk ...
He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) got up, walked slowly down to the first-floor landing, and stood there for
a moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) handkerchief from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) back pocket, wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lips with it,
and considered going down and pounding on the bedroom door, demanding to be let
in so he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could see his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) son. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had no right to be so goddam highhanded.
Well, sooner or later she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'d have to come out, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) planned a radical
sort of diet for the two of them. A rather ugly grin touched his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lips at the
thought. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) come to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would in time.
He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went downstairs to the ground floor, stood aimlessly by the lobby desk for
a moment, then turned right. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went into the dining room and stood just inside
the door. The empty tables, their white linen cloths neatly cleaned and pressed
beneath their clear plastic covers, glimmered up at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). All was deserted now
but
-LRB-Dinner Will Be Served at 8 P.M.
Un-Masking and Dancing At Midnight-RRB-
Jack walked among the tables, momentarily forgetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wife and son
upstairs, forgetting the dream, the smashed radio, the bruises. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) trailed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
fingers over the slick plastic dustcovers, trying to imagine how it must have
been on that hot August night in 1945, the war won, the future stretching ahead so various
and new, like a land of dreams. The bright and particolored Japanese lanterns
hung the whole length of the circular drive, the golden-yellow light spilling
from these high windows that were now drifted over with snow. Men
and women in costume, here a glittering princess, there a high-booted
cavalier, flashing jewelry and flashing wit every
where, dancing, liquor flowing freely, first wine and then cocktails and then
perhaps boilermakers the level of conversation going up and up and up until the jolly cry rang out
from the bandmaster's podium, the cry of <div class="bookquote">``Unmask! Unmask!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the bandmaster</b></font>)</div>-LRB-And the Red Death held sway ...-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) found himself standing on the other side of the dining room, just outside
the stylized batwing doors of the Colorado Lounge where, on that night in 1945,
all the booze would have been free.
-LRB-Belly up to the bar, pardner, the drinks're on the house.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) stepped through the batwings and into the deep, folded shadows of the bar.
And a strange thing occurred. He (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had been in here before, once to check the
inventory sheet Ullman had left, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) knew the place had been stripped clean.
The shelves were totally bare. But now, lit only murkily by the light which
filtered through from the dining room -LRB-which was itself only dimly lit because
of the snow blocking the windows-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) saw ranks and ranks of bottles
twinkling mutedly behind the bar, and syphons, and even beer dripping from the
spigots of all three highly polished taps. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) could even smell beer, that
damp and fermented and yeasty odor, no different from the smell that had hung
finely misted around his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) father's face every night when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) came home from work.
Eyes widening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) fumbled for the wall switch, and the low, intimate barlighting came on, circles of twenty-watt bulbs emplanted on the tops of the
three wagon-wheel chandeliers overhead.

<p/>The shelves were all empty. They had not even as yet gathered a good coat of
dust. The beer taps were dry, as were the chrome drains beneath them. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)
left and right, the velvet-upholstered booths stood like men with high backs,
each one designed to give a maximum of privacy to the couple inside. Straight
ahead, across the red-carpeted floor, forty barstools stood around the
horseshoe-shaped bar. Each stool was upholstered in leather and embossed with
cattle brands -- Circle H, Bar D Bar -LRB-that was fitting-RRB-, Rocking W, Lazy B.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) approached it, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) head a little shake of bewilderment as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) did so.
It was like that day on the playground when ... but there was no sense in
thinking about that. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) could have sworn he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had seen those bottles,
vaguely, it was true, the way you see the darkened shapes of furniture in a room
where the curtains have been drawn. Mild glints on glass. The only thing that
remained was that smell of beer, and Jack knew that was a smell that faded into
the woodwork of every bar in the world after a certain period of time, not to be
eradicated by any cleaner invented. Yet the smell here seemed sharp ... almost
fresh.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) sat down on one of the stools and propped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) elbows on the bar's leathercushioned edge. At his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) left hand was a bowl for peanuts
now empty, of course.
The first bar he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'d been in for nineteen months and the damned thing was dry
just
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) luck. All the same, a bitterly powerful wave of nostalgia swept over him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>),
and the physical craving for a drink seemed to work itself up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) belly to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) throat to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mouth and nose, shriveling and wrinkling the tissues as it
went, making them cry out for something wet and long and cold.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) glanced at the shelves again in wild, irrational hope but the shelves were
just as empty as before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) grinned in pain and frustration. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fists,
clenching slowly, made minute scratchings on the bar's leather-padded edge.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi, Lloyd,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``A little slow tonight, isn't it?''

<div class="bookquote">``Now I'm really glad you asked me that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said, <div class="bookquote">``really glad. Because I
happen to have two twenties and two tens in my wallet and I was afraid they'd be
sitting there until sometime next April. There isn't a Seven-Eleven around here,
would you believe it? And I thought they had Seven-Elevens on the fucking moon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Lloyd sympathized.
<div class="bookquote">``So here's what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``You set me up an even twenty martinis. An even
twenty, just like that, kazang. One for every month I've been on the wagon and
one to grow on. You can do that, can't you? You aren't too busy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lloyd</b></font>)</div>Lloyd said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) wasn't busy at all.
<div class="bookquote">``Good man. You line those martians up right along the bar and I'm going to
take them down, one by one. White man's burden, Lloyd my man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lloyd</b></font>)</div>Lloyd turned to do the job. Jack reached into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pocket for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) money clip
and came out with an Excedrin bottle instead. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) money clip was on the bedroom
bureau, and of course his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) skinny-shanks wife had locked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) out of the bedroom.
Nice going, Wendy. You bleeding bitch.
<div class="bookquote">``I seem to be momentarily light,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``How's my credit in this joint,
anyhow?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lloyd</b></font>)</div>Lloyd said his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) credit was fine.
``That's super. I like you, Lloyd. You were always the best of them. Best
damned barkeep between Barre and Portland, Maine. Portland, Oregon, for that

<p/>matter.''
Lloyd thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) for saying so.
Jack thumped the cap from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) Excedrin bottle, shook two tablets out, and
flipped them into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mouth. The familiar acid-compelling taste flooded in.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had a sudden sensation that people were watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), curiously and with
some contempt. The booths behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) were full
there were graying, distinguished
men and beautiful young girls, all of them in costume, watching this sad
exercise in the dramatic arts with cold amusement.
Jack whirled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stool.
The booths were all empty, stretching away from the lounge door to the left
and right, the line on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) left cornering to flank the bar's horseshoe curve
down the short length of the room. Padded leather seats and backs. Gleaming dark
Formica tables, an ashtray on each one, a book of matches in each ashtray, the
words Colorado Lounge stamped on each in gold leaf above the batwing-door logo.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) turned back, swallowing the rest of the dissolving Excedrin with a grimace.
``Lloyd, you're a wonder,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said. ``Set up already. Your speed is only
exceeded by the soulful beauty of your Neapolitan eyes. Salud.''
Jack contemplated the twenty imaginary drinks, the martini glasses blushing
droplets of condensation, each with a swizzle poked through a plump green olive.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could almost smell gin on the air.
``The wagon,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said. ``Have you ever been acquainted with a gentleman who has
hopped up on the wagon?''
Lloyd allowed as how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) had met such men from time to time.
``Have you ever renewed acquaintances with such a man after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hopped back off?''
Lloyd could not, in all honesty, recall.
``You never did, then,'' Jack said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) curled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hand around the first drink,
carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fist to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mouth, which was open, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fist up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
swallowed and then tossed the imaginary glass over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shoulder. The people were
back again, fresh from their costume ball, studying him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), laughing behind their
hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could feel them. If the backbar had featured a mirror instead of those
damn stupid empty shelves, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could have seen them. Let them stare. Fuck them.
Let anybody stare who wanted to stare.
``No, you never did,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) told Lloyd. <div class="bookquote">``Few men ever return from the fabled
Wagon, but those who do come with a fearful tale to tell. When you jump on, it
seems like the brightest, cleanest Wagon you ever saw, with ten-foot wheels to
keep the bed of it high out of the gutter where all the drunks are laying around
with their brown bags and their Thunderbird and their Granddad Flash's Popskull
Bourbon. You're away from all the people who throw you nasty looks and tell you
to clean up your act or go put it on in another town. From the gutter, that's
the finest-lookin Wagon you ever saw, Lloyd my boy. All hung with bunting and a
brass band in front and three majorettes to each side, twirling their batons and
flashing their panties at you. Man, you got to get on that Wagon and away from
the juicers that are straining canned heat and smelling their own puke to get
high again and poking along the gutter for butts with half an inch left below
the filter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) drained two more imaginary drinks and tossed the glasses back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>)
shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) could almost hear them smashing on the floor. And goddam if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>)
wasn't starting to feel high. It was the Excedrin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you climb up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) told Lloyd. <div class="bookquote">``and ain't you glad to be there. My God yes,
that's affirmative. That Wagon is the biggest and best float in the whole
parade, and everybody is lining the streets and clapping and cheering and
waving, all for you. Except for the winos passed out in the gutter. Those guys
used to be your friends, but that's all behind you now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) empty fist to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) mouth and sluiced down another -- four down,
sixteen to go. Making excellent progress. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) swayed a little on the stool. Let
em stare, if that was how they got off. Take a picture, folks, it'll last
longer.
<div class="bookquote">``Then you start to see things, Lloydy-my-boy. Things you missed from the
gutter. Like how the floor of the Wagon is nothing but straight pine boards, so
fresh they're still bleeding sap, and if you took your shoes off you'd be sure
to get a splinter. Like how the only furniture in the Wagon is these long
benches with high backs and no cushions to sit on, and in fact they are nothing
but pews with a songbook every five feet or so. Like how all the people sitting
in the pews on the Wagon are these flatchested el birdos in long dresses with a
little lace around the collar and their hair pulled back into buns until it's so
tight you can almost hear it screaming. And every face is flat and pale and
shiny, and they're all singing `Shall we gather at the riiiiver, the beautiful,
the beautiful, the riiiiiver,' and up front there's this reekin bitch with blond
hair playing the organ and tellin em to sing louder, sing louder. And somebody
slams a songbook into your hands and says, `Sing it out, brother. If you expect
to stay on this Wagon, you got to sing morning, noon, and night. Especially at
night.' And that's when you realize what the Wagon really is, Lloyd. It's a
church with bars on the windows, a church for women and a prison for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) stopped. Lloyd was gone. Worse still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) had never been there. The drinks
had never been there. Only the people in the booths, the people from the costume
party, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) could almost hear their muffled laughter as they held their hands
to their mouths and pointed, their eyes sparkling with cruel pinpoints of light.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) whirled around again. <div class="bookquote">``Leave me -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-alone?-RRB-
All the booths were empty. The sound of laughter had died like a stir of
autumn leaves. Jack stared at the empty lounge for a tick of time, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes wide
and dark. A pulse beat noticeably in the center of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) forehead. In the very
center of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) a cold certainty was forming and the certainty was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was
losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) felt an urge to pick up the bar stool next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), reverse
it, and go through the place like an avenging whirlwind. Instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) whirled back
around to the bar and began to bellow:
<div class="bookquote">``Roll me over
In the clo-ho-ver,
Roll me over, lay me down and do it again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Danny's face rose before him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), not Danny's normal face, lively and alert, the
eyes sparkling and open, but the catatonic, zombielike face of a stranger, the
eyes dull and opaque, the mouth pursed babyishly around his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) thumb. What was he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
doing, sitting here and talking to himself like a sulky teen-ager when his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) son
was upstairs, someplace, acting like something that belonged in a padded room,

<p/>acting the way Wally Hollis said Vic Stenger had been before the men in the
white coats had to come and take him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollis</b></font>) away?
-LRB-But I never put a hand on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollis</b></font>)! Goddammit, I didn't!-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``Jack?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The voice was timid, hesitant.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hollis</b></font>) was so startled he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollis</b></font>) almost fell off the stool whirling it around. Wendy was
standing just inside the batwing doors, Danny cradled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arms like some
waxen horror show dummy. The three of them made a tableau that Jack felt very
strongly; it was just before the curtain of Act II in some oldtime temperance
play, one so poorly mounted that the prop man had forgotten to stock the shelves
of the Den of Iniquity.
<div class="bookquote">``I never touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said thickly. <div class="bookquote">``I never have since the night I
broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) arm. Not even to spank him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jack, that doesn't matter now. What matters is
''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This matters!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shouted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) brought one fist crashing down on the bar, hard
enough to make the empty peanut dishes jump. <div class="bookquote">``It matters, goddammit, it matters!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jack, we have to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) off the mountain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s
''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny began to stir in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arms. The slack, empty expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face had
begun to break up like a thick matte of ice over some buried surface. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lips
twisted, as if at some weird taste. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes widened. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands came up as if to
cover them and then dropped back.
Abruptly he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stiffened in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arms. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) back arched into a bow, making Wendy
stagger. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) suddenly began to shriek, mad sounds that escaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) straining
throat in bolt after crazy, echoing bolt. The sound seemed to fill the empty
downstairs and come back at them like banshees. There might have been a hundred
Dannys, all screaming at once.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cried in terror. <div class="bookquote">``Oh God Jack what's wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) came off the stool, numb from the waist down, more frightened than he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had
ever been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) life. What hole had his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) son poked through and into? What dark
nest? And what had been in there to sting him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)?
<div class="bookquote">``Danny!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) roared. <div class="bookquote">``Danny!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother's grip with a sudden, fierce strength that
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) no chance to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stumbled back against one of the booths and
nearly fell into it.
<div class="bookquote">``Daddy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) screamed, running to Jack, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes huge and affrighted. <div class="bookquote">``Oh Daddy
Daddy, it was her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)! Her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)! Her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)! Oh Daaaaahdeee -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) slammed into Jack's arms like a blunt arrow, making Jack rock on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) feet.
Danny clutched at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) furiously, at first seeming to pummel him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) like a fighter,
then clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) belt and sobbing against his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shirt. Jack could feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) son's
face, hot and working, against his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) belly.
Daddy, it was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
Jack looked slowly up into Wendy's face. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes were like small silver
coins.
<div class="bookquote">``Wendy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Voice soft, nearly purring. <div class="bookquote">``Wendy, what did you do to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy stared back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) in stunned disbelief, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face pallid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
head.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh Jack, you must know -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Outside it had begun to snow again.

KITCHEN TALK
Jack carried Danny into the kitchen. The boy was still sobbing wildly,
refusing to look up from Jack's chest. In the kitchen he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) gave Danny back to
Wendy, who still seemed stunned and disbelieving.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack, I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s talking about. Please, you must believe that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had to admit to himself that it gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) a certain amount of pleasure to see the shoe switched to the other foot with
such dazzling, unexpected speed. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) anger at Wendy had been only a passing
gut twitch. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knew Wendy would pour a can of gasoline over herself
and strike a match before harming Danny.
The large tea kettle was on the back burner, poking along on low heat. Jack
dropped a teabag into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own large ceramic cup and poured hot water halfway.
<div class="bookquote">``Got cooking sherry, don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) asked Wendy.
<div class="bookquote">``What? ... oh, sure. Two or three bottles of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Which cupboard?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) pointed, and Jack took one of the bottles down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) poured a hefty dollop
into the teacup, put the sherry back, and filled the last quarter of the cup
with milk. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) added three tablespoons of sugar and stirred. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) brought it
to Danny, whose sobs had tapered off to snifflings and hitchings. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was
trembling all over, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes were wide and starey.
<div class="bookquote">``Want you to drink this, doc,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``It's going to taste frigging awful,
but it'll make you feel better. Can you drink it for your daddy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny nodded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could and took the cup. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) drank a little, grimaced, and
looked questioningly at Jack. Jack nodded and Danny drank again. Wendy felt the
familiar twist of jealousy somewhere in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) middle, knowing the boy would not
have drunk it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
On the heels of that came an uncomfortable, even startling thought: Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
wanted to think Jack was to blame? Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) that jealous? It was the way her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
mother would have thought, that was the really horrible thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could
remember a Sunday when her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) Dad had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) to the park and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had toppled
from the second tier of the jungle gym, cutting both knees. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) father
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) home, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother had shrieked at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>): What did you do? Why weren't
you watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)? What kind of a father are you?
-LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had hounded him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grave; by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) divorced her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) it was too
late.-RRB-
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had never even given Jack the benefit of the doubt. Not the smallest.
Wendy felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face burn yet knew with a kind of helpless finality that if the
whole thing were to be played over again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would do and think the same way.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) carried part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) always, for good or bad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jack -- ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) began, not sure if she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) meant to apologize or justify. Either, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
knew, would be useless.
<div class="bookquote">``Not now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said.
It took Danny fifteen minutes to drink half of the big cup's contents, and by
that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had calmed visibly. The shakes were almost gone.
Jack put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands solemnly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) son's shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``Danny, do you think you
can tell us exactly what happened to you? It's very important.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny looked from Jack to Wendy, then back again. In the silent pause, their
setting and situation made themselves known: the whoop of the wind outside,
driving fresh snow down from the northwest; the creaking and groaning of the old
hotel as it settled into another storm. The fact of their disconnect came to
Wendy with unexpected force as it sometimes did, like a blow under the heart.
<div class="bookquote">``I want ... to tell you everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I had before.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
picked up the cup and held it, as if comforted by the warmth.
<div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you, son?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack brushed Danny's sweaty, tumbled hair back gently
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) brow.
<div class="bookquote">``Because Uncle Al got you the job. And I couldn't figure out how it was good
for you here and bad for you here at the same time. It was ...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) looked at
them for help. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did not have the necessary word.
<div class="bookquote">``A dilemma?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy asked gently. <div class="bookquote">``When neither choice seems any good?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) nodded, relieved.
Wendy said: <div class="bookquote">``The day that you trimmed the hedges, Danny and I had a talk in
the truck. The day the first real snow came. Remember?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack nodded. The day he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had trimmed the hedges was very clear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mind.
Wendy sighed. <div class="bookquote">``I guess we didn't talk enough. Did we, doc?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny, the picture of woe, shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Exactly what did you talk about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack asked. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure how much I like
my wife and son -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">'' -- discussing how much they love you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whatever it was, I don't understand it. I feel like I came into a movie just

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We were discussing you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said quietly. <div class="bookquote">``And maybe we didn't say it all

just understands things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack was silent.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny said it just right. The place seemed good for you. You were away from
all the pressures that made you so unhappy at Stovington. You were your own

was working, because it's patched directly into the outside line. You told me so
yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then how could you know what Al told me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Danny told me. Danny knew. The same way he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sometimes knows when things are
misplaced, or when people are thinking about divorce.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The doctor said -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) head impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``The doctor was full of shit and we both know
it. We've known it all the time. Remember when Danny said he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wanted to see the

afraid ...''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked at the bruises on Danny's neck.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you really know Uncle Al had called me, Danny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny nodded. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was really mad, Daddy. Because you called Mr. Ullman and Mr.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jesus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said again. <div class="bookquote">``The bruises, Danny. Who tried to strangle you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny's face went dark. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The woman in that room.

Jack and Wendy exchanged a scared look over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) bowed head.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you know anything about this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Danny?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) raised the boy's frightened face. <div class="bookquote">``Try, son. We're right here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I knew it was bad here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``Ever since we were in

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What dreams?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't remember everything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) showed me the Overlook at night, with a skull

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's that, doc?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy asked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Rum, like yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack asked.
Danny shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head again. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Then we got here, and Mr. Hallorann

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny made a sweeping, all-encompassing gesture with his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands.
<div class="bookquote">``It's being able to understand things. To know things. Sometimes you see things.

pride he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hallorann said I had the best shine of anyone he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) ever met.
We could talk back and forth to each other without hardly opening our mouths.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) parents looked at each other again, frankly stunned.
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hallorann got me alone because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) was worried,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny went on. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) said

something, too; Right after I talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>). When Mr. Ullman was taking us
around.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack asked.
<div class="bookquote">``In the Presidential Sweet. On the wall by the door going into the bedroom. A

gushy stuff must have been brains.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh my God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said.
Wendy was now very pale, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lips nearly gray.
<div class="bookquote">``This place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``Some pretty bad types owned it awhile back.
Organization people from Las Vegas.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Crooks?''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, crooks.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked at Wendy. <div class="bookquote">``In 1966 a big-time hood named Vito
Gienelli got killed up there, along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gienelli</b></font>) two bodyguards. There was a picture
in the newspaper. Danny just described the picture.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hallorann said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) saw some other stuff,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny told them. <div class="bookquote">``Once about the
playground. And once it was something bad in that room. 217. A maid saw it and
lost her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) job because she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) talked about it. So Mr. Hallorann went up and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) saw it
too. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) didn't talk about it because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) didn't want to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) job. Except
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) told me never to go in there. But I did. Because I believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) said
the things you saw here couldn't hurt you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>This last was nearly whispered in a
low, husky voice, and Danny touched the puffed circle of bruises on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) neck.
<div class="bookquote">``What about the playground?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack asked in a strange, casual voice.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know. The playground, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) said. And the hedge animals.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack jumped a little, and Wendy looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) curiously.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you seen anything down there, Jack?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said again, more calmly. And that was true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been the
victim of an hallucination. And that was all.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny, we have to hear about the woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said gently.
So Danny told them, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) words came in cyclic bursts, sometimes almost
verging on incomprehensible garble in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hurry to spit it out and be free of
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pushed tighter and tighter against his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother's breasts as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) talked.
<div class="bookquote">``I went in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I stole the passkey and went in. It was like I couldn't
help myself. I had to know. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ... the lady ... was in the tub. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
dead. All swelled up. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was nuh-nuh ... didn't have no clothes on.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
looked miserably at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) started to get up and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted me. I
know she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did because I could feel it. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wasn't even thinking, not the way you

wasps that night in my room! Only wanting to hurt. Like the wasps.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) swallowed and there was silence for a moment, all quiet while the image of

<p/>the wasps sank into them.
<div class="bookquote">``So I ran,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. <div class="bookquote">``I ran but the door was closed. I left it open but it

there ... she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would go away. But it didn't work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) voice began to rise hysterically.

 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stop now, shhh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said, alarmed. <div class="bookquote">``Stop, Danny. It's all right. It -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was getting ready to go into her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) croon again. The Wendy Torrance Allpurpose Croon. Pat. Pending.
<div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) finish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said curtly.
<div class="bookquote">``There isn't any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. <div class="bookquote">``I passed out. Either because she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was

sweater and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) began to cry with horrible weakness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands lying limp and
spent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lap.
Jack got up. <div class="bookquote">``Take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face was full of dread.

(<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shrieked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). Spittle flew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
lips with the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cry.
Jack said: <div class="bookquote">``Wendy, that's a remarkable imitation of your mom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) burst into tears then, unable to cover her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face because Danny was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
lap.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``But I have to, you know. I'm the goddam caretaker.

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) only cried harder and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) that way, going out of the kitchen,
rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mouth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) handkerchief as the door swung shut behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Don't worry, mommy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>)'ll be all right. He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) doesn't shine.

217 REVISITED

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) took the elevator up and it was strange, because none of them had used the
elevator since they moved in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) threw the brass handle over and it wheezed
vibratoriously up the shaft, the brass grate rattling madly. Wendy had a true
claustrophobe's horror of the elevator, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) envisioned the three of
them trapped in it between floors while the winter storms raged outside, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
could see them growing thinner and weaker, starving to death. Or perhaps dining
on each other, the way those Rugby players had. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) remembered a bumper sticker
he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had seen in Boulder, RUGBY PLAYERS EAT THEIR OWN DEAD. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could think of
others. YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT. Or menu items. Welcome to the Overlook Dining
Room, Pride of the Rockies. Eat in Splendor at the Roof of the World. Human
Haunch Broiled Over Matches La Specialite de la Maison. The contemptuous smile
flicked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) features again. As the number 2 rose on the shaft wall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
threw the brass handle back to the home position and the elevator car creaked to
a stop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) Excedrin from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pocket, shook three of them into his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand,
and opened the elevator door. Nothing in the Overlook frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) felt
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and it were simpatico.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) walked up the hall flipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) Excedrin into his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth and chewing them
one by one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) rounded the corner into the short corridor off the main hall. The
door to Room 217 was ajar, and the passkey hung from the lock on its white
paddle.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) frowned, feeling a wave of irritation and even real anger. Whatever had
come of it, the boy had been trespassing. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been told, and told bluntly,
that certain areas of the hotel were off limits: the equipment shed, the
basement, and all of the guest rooms. He (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) would talk to Danny about that just as
soon as the boy was over his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fright. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) reasonably but
sternly. There were plenty of fathers who would have done more than just talk.
They would have administered a good shaking, and perhaps that was what Danny
needed. If the boy had gotten a scare, wasn't that at least his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) just deserts?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) walked down to the door, removed the passkey, dropped it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pocket,
and stepped inside. The overhead light was on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) glanced at the bed, saw it was
not rumpled, and then walked directly across to the bathroom door. A curious
certainty had grown in him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). Although Watson had mentioned no names or room
numbers, Jack felt sure that this was the room the lawyer's wife and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stud
had shared, that this was the bathroom where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been found dead, full of
barbiturates and Colorado Lounge booze.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pushed the mirror-backed bathroom door open and stepped through. The light
in here was off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) turned it on and observed the long, Pullman-car room,
furnished in the distinctive early nineteen-hundreds-remodeled-in-the-twenties
style that seemed common to all Overlook bathrooms, except for the ones on the
third floor -- those were properly Byzantine, as befitted the royalty, politicians,
movie stars, and capos who had stayed there over the years.
The shower curtain, a pallid pastel pink, was drawn protectively around the
long claw-footed tub.
-LRB-nevertheless they did move-RRB-
And for the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) new sense of sureness -LRB-almost cockiness-RRB-
that had come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) when Danny ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shouting It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)! It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)!

<p/>deserting him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). A chilled finger pressed gently against the base of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) spine,
cooling him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) off ten degrees. It was joined by others and they suddenly rippled
all the way up his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) medulla oblongata, playing his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) spine like a
jungle instrument.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) anger at Danny evaporated, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stepped forward and pushed the shower
curtain back his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth was dry and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) felt only sympathy for his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) son and terror
for himself.
The tub was dry and empty.
Relief and irritation vented in a sudden <div class="bookquote">``Pah!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sound that escaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
compressed lips like a very small explosive. The tub had been scrubbed clean at
the end of the season; except for the rust stain under the twin faucets, it
sparkled. There was a faint but definable smell of cleanser, the kind that can
irritate your nose with the smell of its own righteousness for weeks, even
months, after it has been used.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bent down and ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fingertips along the bottom of the tub. Dry as a
bone. Not even a hint of moisture. The boy had been either hallucinating or
outright lying. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) felt angry again. That was when the bathmat on the floor
caught his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) frowned down at it. What was a bathmat doing in here?
It should be down in the linen cupboard at the end of the wing with the rest of
the sheets and towels and pillow slips. All the linen was supposed to be there.
Not even the beds were really made up in these guest rooms; the mattresses had
been zipped into clear plastic and then covered with bedspreads. He (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) supposed
Danny might have gone down and gotten it -- the passkey would open the linen
cupboard -- but why? He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) brushed the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fingers back and forth across it.
The bathmat was bone dry.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went back to the bathroom door and stood in it. Everything was all right.
The boy had been dreaming. There was not a thing out of place. It was a little
puzzling about the bathmat, granted, but the logical explanation was that some
chambermaid, hurrying like mad on the last day of the season, had just forgotten
to pick it up. Other than that, everything was --
His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nostrils flared a little. Disinfectant, that self-righteous smell,
cleaner-than-thou. And --
Soap?
Surely not. But once the smell had been identified, it was too clear to
dismiss. Soap. And not one of those postcard-size bars of Ivory they provide you
with in hotels and motels, either. This scent was light and perfumed, a lady's
soap. It had a pink sort of smell. Camay or Lowila, the brand that Wendy had
always used in Stovington.
-LRB-It's nothing. It's your imagination.-RRB-
-LRB-yes like the hedges nevertheless they did move-RRB-
-LRB-They did not move!-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) crossed jerkily to the door which gave on the hall, feeling the irregular
thump of a headache beginning at his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) temples. Too much had happened today, too
much by far. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wouldn't spank the boy or shake him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), just talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), but by
God, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wasn't going to add Room 217 to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) problems. Not on the basis of a dry
bathmat and a faint smell of Lowila soap. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) --
There was a sudden rattling, metallic sound behind him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). It came just as his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
hand closed around the doorknob, and an observer might have thought the brushed

<p/>steel of the knob carried an electric charge. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) jerked convulsively, eyes
widening, other facial features drawing in, grimacing.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had control of himself, a little, anyway, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) let go of the
doorknob and turned carefully around. His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) joints creaked. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) began to walk back
to the bathroom door, step by leaden step.
The shower curtain, which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had pushed back to look into the tub, was now
drawn. The metallic rattle, which had sounded to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) like a stir of bones in a
crypt, had been the curtain rings on the overhead bar. Jack stared at the
curtain. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face felt as if it had been heavily waxed, all dead skin on the
outside, live, hot rivulets of fear on the inside. The way he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had felt on the
playground.
There was something behind the pink plastic shower curtain. There was
something in the tub.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could see it, ill defined and obscure through the plastic, a nearly
amorphous shape. It could have been anything. A trick of the light. The shadow
of the shower attachment. A woman long dead and reclining in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bath, a bar of
Lowila in one stiffening hand as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) waited patiently for whatever lover might
come.
Jack told himself to step forward boldly and rake the shower curtain back. To
expose whatever might be there. Instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) turned with jerky, marionette
strides, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heart whamming frightfully in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) chest, and went back into the
bed/sitting room.
The door to the hall was shut.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stared at it for a long, immobile second. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could taste his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) terror now. It
was in the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) throat like a taste of gone-over cherries.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) walked to the door with that same jerky stride and forced his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fingers to
curl around the knob.
-LRB-It won't open.-RRB-
But it did.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) turned off the light with a fumbling gesture, stepped out into the hall,
and pulled the door shut without looking back. From inside, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) seemed to hear an
odd wet thumping sound, far off, dim, as if something had just scrambled
belatedly out of the tub, as if to greet a caller, as if it had realized the
caller was leaving before the social amenities had been completed and so it was
now rushing to the door, all purple and grinning, to invite the caller back
inside. Perhaps forever.
Footsteps approaching the door or only the heartbeat in his (<font color='blue'><b>caller</b></font>) ears?
He (<font color='blue'><b>caller</b></font>) fumbled at the passkey. It seemed sludgy, unwilling to turn in the lock. He (<font color='blue'><b>caller</b></font>)
attacked the passkey. The tumblers suddenly fell and he (<font color='blue'><b>caller</b></font>) stepped back against the
corridor's far wall, a little groan of relief escaping him (<font color='blue'><b>caller</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>caller</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>caller</b></font>) eyes
and all the old phrases began to parade through his (<font color='blue'><b>caller</b></font>) mind, it seemed there must
be hundreds of them,
-LRB-cracking up not playing with a full deck lost ya marbles guy just went loony
tunes he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) went up and over the high side went bananas lost his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) football crackers
nuts half a seabag-RRB-
all meaning the same thing: losing your mind.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) whimpered, hardly aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) had been reduced to this, whimpering
with his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) eyes shut like a child. <div class="bookquote">``Oh no, God. Please, God, no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But below the tumble of his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) chaotic thoughts, below the triphammer beat of his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>)
heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) could hear the soft and futile sound of the doorknob being turned to
and fro as something locked in tried helplessly to get out, something that
wanted to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>), something that would like to be introduced to his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) family as
the storm shrieked around them and white daylight became black night. If he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>)
opened his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) eyes and saw that doorknob moving he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) would go mad. So he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) kept them
shut, and after an unknowable time, there was stillness.
Jack forced himself to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes, half-convinced that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did, she (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>)
would be standing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). But the hall was empty.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) felt watched just the same.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) looked at the peephole in the center of the door and wondered what would
happen if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) approached it, stared into it. What would he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) be eyeball to eyeball
with?
His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) feet were moving
-LRB-feets don't fail me now-RRB-
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) realized it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) turned them away from the door and walked down to
the main hall, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) feet whispering on the blue-black jungle carpet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stopped
halfway to the stairs and looked at the fire extinguisher. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) thought that the
folds of canvas were arranged in a slightly different manner. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was quite
sure that the brass nozzle had been pointing toward the elevator when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) came up
the hall. Now it was pointing the other way.
<div class="bookquote">``I didn't see that at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack Torrance said quite clearly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) face was
white and haggard and his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) mouth kept trying to grin.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) didn't take the elevator back down. It was too much like an open mouth.
Too much by half. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) took the stairs.

<p/><< 31 >>
THE VERDICT
He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) stepped into the kitchen and looked at them, bouncing the passkey a few
inches up off his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) left hand, making the chain on the white metal tongue jingle,
then catching it again. Danny was pallid and worn out. Wendy had been crying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
saw; her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) eyes were red and darkly circled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) felt a sudden burst of gladness at
this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wasn't suffering alone, that was sure.
They looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) without speaking.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said, astounded by the heartiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``Not a
thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bounced the passkey up and down, up and down, smiling reassuringly at them,
watching the relief spread over their faces, and thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had never in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
life wanted a drink so badly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) did right now.

THE BEDROOM
Late that afternoon Jack got a cot from the first-floor storage room and put
it in the corner of their bedroom. Wendy had expected that the boy would be half
the night getting to sleep, but Danny was nodding before <div class="bookquote">``The Waltons''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>was half
over, and fifteen minutes after they had tucked him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) in he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was far down in
sleep, moveless, one hand tucked under his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) cheek. Wendy sat watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>),
holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) place in a fat paperback copy of Cashelmara with one finger. Jack
sat at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) desk, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) play.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh shit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said.
Wendy looked up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) contemplation of Danny. <div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked down at the play with smoldering ill-temper. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) have
thought it was good? It was puerile. It had been done a thousand times. Worse,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had no idea how to finish it. Once it had seemed simple enough. Denker, in a
fit of rage, seizes the poker from beside the fireplace and beats saintly Gary
to death. Then, standing spread-legged over the body, the bloody poker in one
hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gary</b></font>) screams at the audience: <div class="bookquote">``It's here somewhere and I will find it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the audience</b></font>)</div>Then, as the lights dim and the curtain is slowly drawn, the audience sees
Gary's body face down on the forestage as Denker strides to the upstage bookcase
and feverishly begins pulling books from the shelves, looking at them, throwing
them aside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denker</b></font>) had thought it was something old enough to be new, a play whose
novelty alone might be enough to see it through a successful Broadway run: a
tragedy in five acts.
But, in addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Denker</b></font>) sudden diversion of interest to the Overlooks
history, something else had happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denker</b></font>) had developed opposing feelings about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denker</b></font>) characters. This was something quite new. Ordinarily he (<font color='blue'><b>Denker</b></font>) liked all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denker</b></font>)
characters, the good and the bad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denker</b></font>) was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Denker</b></font>) did. It allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Denker</b></font>) to try to
see all of their sides and understand their motivations more clearly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Denker</b></font>)
favorite story, sold to a small southern Maine magazine called Contraband for
copies, had been a piece called <div class="bookquote">``The Monkey Is Here, Paul DeLong.''  (<font color='red'><b>child</b></font>)</div>It had been
about a child molester about to commit suicide in his (<font color='blue'><b>molester</b></font>) furnished room. The child
molester's name had been Paul DeLong, Monkey to his (<font color='blue'><b>Monkey</b></font>) friends. Jack had liked
Monkey very much. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) sympathized with Monkey's bizarre needs, knowing that
Monkey was not the only one to blame for the three rape-murders in his (<font color='blue'><b>Monkey</b></font>) past.
There had been bad parents, the father a beater as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own father had been, the
mother a limp and silent dishrag as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother had been. A homosexual experience
in grammar school. Public humiliation. Worse experiences in high school and
college. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been arrested and sent to an institution after exposing himself
to a pair of little girls getting off a school bus. Worst of all, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been

<p/>dismissed from the institution, let back out onto the streets, because the man
in charge had decided he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was all right. This man's name had been Grimmer.
Grimmer had known that Monkey DeLong was exhibiting deviant symptoms, but he (<font color='blue'><b>DeLong</b></font>) had
written the good, hopeful report and had let him (<font color='blue'><b>DeLong</b></font>) go anyway. Jack liked and
sympathized with Grimmer, too. Grimmer had to run an understaffed and
underfunded institution and try to keep the whole thing together with spit,
baling wire, and nickle-and-dime appropriations from a state legislature who had
to go back and face the voters. Grimmer knew that Monkey could interact with
other people, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did not soil his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pants or try to stab his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fellow inmates
with the scissors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was Napoleon. The staff psychiatrist in
charge of Monkey's case thought there was a better-than-even chance that Monkey
could make it on the street, and they both knew that the longer a man is in an
institution the more he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes to need that closed environment, like a junkie
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smack. And meanwhile, people were knocking down the doors. Paranoids,
schizoids, cycloids, semicatatonics, men who claimed to have gone to heaven in
flying saucers, women who had burned their children's sex organs off with Bic
lighters, alcoholics, pyromaniacs, kleptomaniacs, manic-depressives, suicidals.
Tough old world, baby. If you're not bolted together tightly, you're gonna
shake, rattle, and roll before you turn thirty. Jack could sympathize with
Grimmer's problem. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could sympathize with the parents of the murder victims.
With the murdered children themselves, of course. And with Monkey DeLong. Let
the reader lay blame. In those days he (<font color='blue'><b>DeLong</b></font>) hadn't wanted to judge. The cloak of the
moralist sat badly on his (<font color='blue'><b>DeLong</b></font>) shoulders.
He (<font color='blue'><b>DeLong</b></font>) had started The Little School in the same optimistic vein. But lately he (<font color='blue'><b>DeLong</b></font>)
had begun to choose up sides, and worse still, he (<font color='blue'><b>DeLong</b></font>) had come to loathe his (<font color='blue'><b>DeLong</b></font>) hero,
Gary Benson. Originally conceived as a bright boy more cursed with money than
blessed with it, a boy who wanted more than anything to compile a good record so
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could go to a good university because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had earned admission and not because
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father had pulled strings, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had become to Jack a kind of simpering Goody
Two-shoes, a postulant before the altar of knowledge rather than a sincere
acolyte, an outward paragon of Boy Scout virtues, inwardly cynical, filled not
with real brilliance -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) had first been conceived-RRB- but only with sly animal
cunning. All through the play he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) unfailingly addressed Denker as <div class="bookquote">``sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Denker</b></font>)</div>just as
Jack had taught his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own son to address those older and those in authority as
<div class="bookquote">``sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) thought that Danny used the word quite sincerely, and Gary Benson as
originally conceived had too, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) had begun Act V, it had come more and
more strongly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) that Gary was using the word satirically, outwardly
straight-faced while the Gary Benson inside was mugging and leering at Denker.
Denker, who had never had any of the things Gary had. Denker, who had had to
work all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gary</b></font>) life just to become head of a single little school. Who was now
faced with ruin over this handsome, innocent-seeming rich boy who had cheated on
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Final Composition and had then cunningly covered his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tracks. Jack had seen
Denker the teacher as not much different from the strutting South American
little Caesars in their banana kingdoms, standing dissidents up against the wall
of the handiest squash or handball court, a super-zealot in a comparatively
small puddle, a man whose every whim becomes a crusade. In the beginning he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
wanted to use his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) play as a microcosm to say something about the abuse of power.
Now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tended more and more to see Denker as a Mr. Chips figure, and the tragedy

<p/>was not the intellectual racking of Gary Benson but rather the destruction of a
kindly old teacher and headmaster unable to see through the cynical wiles of
this monster masquerading as a boy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hadn't been able to finish the play.
Now he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sat looking down at it, scowling, wondering if there was any way he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
could salvage the situation. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't really think there was. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bad begun with
one play and it had somehow turned into another, presto-chango. Well, what the
hell. Either way it had been done before. Either way it was a load of shit. And
why was he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) driving himself crazy about it tonight anyway? After the day just
gone by it was no wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) couldn't think straight.
<div class="bookquote">'' -- get him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) down?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked up, trying to blink the cobwebs away. <div class="bookquote">``Huh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I said, how are we going to get him (<font color='blue'><b>DeLong</b></font>) down? We've got to get him (<font color='blue'><b>DeLong</b></font>) out of here,
Jack.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For a moment his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wits were so scattered that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wasn't even sure what she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was
talking about. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) realized and uttered a short, barking laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``You say that as if it were so easy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No problem, Wendy. I'll just change clothes in that telephone booth down in
the lobby and fly him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to Denver on my back. Superman Jack Torrance, they called
me in my salad days.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face registered slow hurt.
<div class="bookquote">``I understand the problem, Jack. The radio is broken. The snow ... but you
have to understand Danny's problem. My God, don't you? He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was nearly catatonic,
Jack! What if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hadn't come out of that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said, a trifle shortly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been frightened at Danny's
blank-eyed, slack-faced state too, of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had. At first. But the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
thought about it, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wondered if it hadn't been a piece of play-acting
put on to escape his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) punishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had, after all, been trespassing.
<div class="bookquote">``All the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and sat on the end of the bed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
desk. Her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face was both surprised and worried. <div class="bookquote">``Jack, the bruises on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) neck!
Something got at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)! And I want him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) away from it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't shout,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``My head aches, Wendy. I'm as worried about this as
you are, so please ... don't ... shout.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``I won't shout. But I don't
understand you, Jack. Someone is in here with us. And not a very nice someone,
either. We have to get down to Sidewinder, not just Danny but all of us.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">'' `We have to get down, we have to get down,' you keep saying that. You must

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think you're my husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said softly, and looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Superman</b></font>) temper flared. He (<font color='blue'><b>Superman</b></font>) slammed the playscript down, knocking the edges of the
pile out of true again and crumpling the sheets on the bottom.
<div class="bookquote">``It's time you got some of the home truths into you, Wendy. You don't seem to
have internalized them, as the sociologists say. They're knocking around up in

 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny had suddenly become active in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bed. Still sleeping, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had begun to

<p/>twist and turn. The way he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) always did when we fought, Wendy thought dismally.
And we're doing it again.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't wake him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) up, Jack. Please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) glanced over at Danny and some of the flush went out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``Okay.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I sounded mad, Wendy. It's not really for you. But I broke
the radio. If it's anybody's fault it's mine. That was our big link to the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, and put a hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shoulder.

<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) rushed on: <div class="bookquote">``But it's not just you. I worry

about this thing, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ranger</b></font>) calls his (<font color='blue'><b>Ranger</b></font>) shine. I worry. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ranger</b></font>)'s little and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ranger</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand had tightened painfully on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shoulder in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) agitation, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
didn't move away. One hand found the firm weight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) left breast and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) began
to stroke it through her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shirt.
<div class="bookquote">``Wendy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said, and stopped. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) to rearrange whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had
to say. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) strong hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breast felt good, soothing. <div class="bookquote">``I could maybe
snowshoe him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could walk part of the way himself, but I would mostly
have to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). It would mean camping out one, two, maybe three nights. That
would mean building a travois to carry supplies and bedrolls on. We have the
AM/FM radio, so we could pick a day when the weather forecast called for a
three-day spell of good weather. But if the forecast was wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) finished,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) voice soft and measured, <div class="bookquote">``I think we might die.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face had paled. It looked shiny, almost ghostly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) continued to stroke
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breast, rubbing the ball of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thumb gently over the nipple.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) made a soft sound -- from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) words or in reaction to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) gentle pressure on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) couldn't tell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand slightly and undid the top
button of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shirt. Wendy shifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) legs slightly. All at once her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) jeans
seemed too tight, slightly irritating in a pleasant sort of way.
<div class="bookquote">``It would mean leaving you alone because you can't snowshoe worth beans. It
would be maybe three days of not knowing. Would you want that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand dropped
to the second button, slipped it, and the beginning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cleavage was exposed.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said in a voice that was slightly thick. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) glanced over at Danny.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had stopped twisting and turning. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thumb had crept back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth. So
that was all right. But Jack was leaving something out of the picture. It was
too bleak. There was something else ... what?
<div class="bookquote">``If we stay put,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said, unbuttoning the third and fourth buttons with
that same deliberate slowness, ``a ranger from the park or a game warden is going
to poke in here just to find out how we're doing. At that point we simply tell

<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>) we want down. He (<font color='blue'><b>warden</b></font>)'ll see to it.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) slipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) naked breasts into the wide V
of the open shirt, bent, and molded his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) lips around the stem of a nipple. It was
hard and erect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) slipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) tongue slowly back and forth across it in a way
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) liked. Wendy moaned a little and arched her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) back.
-LRB-?Something I've forgotten?-RRB-
``Honey?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) asked. On their own her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hands sought the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head so that
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) voice was muffled against her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) flesh.
``How would the ranger take us out?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head slightly to answer and then settled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mouth against the
other nipple.
``If the helicopter was spoken for I guess it would have to be by snowmobile.''
-LRB-!!!-RRB-
``But we have one of those! Ullman said so!''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mouth froze against her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breast for a moment, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) sat up. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) own
face was slightly flushed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) eyes overbright. Jack's on the other hand, was
calm, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been reading a rather dull book instead of engaging in
foreplay with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wife.
``If there's a snowmobile there's no problem,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said excitedly. ``We can all
three go down together.''
``Wendy, I've never driven a snowmobile in my life.''
``It can't be that hard to learn. Back in Vermont you see ten-year-olds driving
them in the fields ... although what their parents can be thinking of I don't
know. And you had a motorcycle when we met.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had, a Honda 350cc. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had
traded it in on a Saab shortly after he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and Wendy took up residence together.
``I suppose I could,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said slowly. ``But I wonder how well it's been
maintained. Ullman and Watson ... they run this place from May to October.
They have summertime minds. I know it won't have gas in it. There may not be
plugs or a battery, either. I don't want you to get your hopes up over your
head, Wendy.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was totally excited now, leaning over him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breasts tumbling out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
shirt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had a sudden impulse to seize one and twist it until she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shrieked.
Maybe that would teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) to shut up.
``The gas is no problem,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. ``The VW and the hotel truck are both full.
There's gas for the emergency generator downstairs, too. And there must be a
gascan out in that shed so you could carry extra.''
``Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said. ``There is.'' Actually there were three of them, two five-gallons
and a two-gallon.
``I'll bet the sparkplugs and the battery are out there too. Nobody would store
their snowmobile in one place and the plugs and battery someplace else, would
they?''
``Doesn't seem likely, does it?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) got up and walked over to where Danny lay
sleeping. A spill of hair had fallen across his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) forehead and Jack brushed it
away gently. Danny didn't stir.
``And if you can get it running you'll take us out?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) asked from behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``On the first day the radio says good weather?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stood looking down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) son, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mixed
feelings dissolved in a wave of love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had said, vulnerable,
fragile. The marks on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) neck were very prominent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'll get it running and we'll get out as quick as we can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank God!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) turned around. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shirt and lay on the bed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) belly
flat, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breasts aimed perkily at the ceiling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was playing with them
lazily, flicking at the nipples. <div class="bookquote">``Hurry up, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said softly, <div class="bookquote">``time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>***
After, with no light burning in the room but the night light that Danny had
brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lay in the crook of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) arm, feeling
deliciously at peace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) found it hard to believe they could be sharing the
Overlook with a murderous stowaway.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hmmmm?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What got at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>stowaway</b></font>) didn't answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) directly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) does have something. Some talent the rest
of us are missing. The most of us, beg pardon. And maybe the Overlook has
something, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ghosts?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Not in the Algernon Blackwood sense, that's for sure. More like
the residues of the feelings of the people who have stayed here. Good things and
bad things. In that sense, I suppose that every big hotel has got its ghosts.
Especially the old ones.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But a dead woman in the tub ... Jack, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s not losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mind, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>stowaway</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) a brief squeeze. <div class="bookquote">``We know he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) goes into ... well, trances, for
want of a better word ... from time to time. We know that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s in them he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
sometimes ... sees? ... things he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) doesn't understand. If precognitive
trances are possible, they're probably functions of the subconscious mind. Freud
said that the subconscious never speaks to us in literal language. Only in
symbols. If you dream about being in a bakery where no one speaks English, you
may be worried about your ability to support your family. Or maybe just that no
one understands you. I've read that the falling dream is a standard outlet for
feelings of insecurity. Games, little games. Conscious on one side of the net,
subconscious on the other, serving some cockamamie image back and forth. Same
with mental illness, with hunches, all of that. Why should precognition be any
different? Maybe Danny really did see blood all over the walls of the
Presidential Suite. To a kid his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) age, the image of blood and the concept of
death are nearly interchangeable. To kids, the image is always more accessible
than the concept, anyway. William Carlos Williams knew that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) was a
pediatrician. When we grow up, concepts gradually get easier and we leave the
images to the poets ... and I'm just rambling on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I like to hear you ramble.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said it, folks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said it. You all heard it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The marks on his (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) neck, Jack. Those are real.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was nothing else for a long time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had begun to think he (<font color='blue'><b>stowaway</b></font>) must have
gone to sleep and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was slipping into a drowse herself when he (<font color='blue'><b>stowaway</b></font>) said:
``I can think of two explanations for those. And neither of them involves a

<p/>fourth party in the hotel.''
``What?'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) came up on one elbow.
``Stigmata, maybe,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>stowaway</b></font>) said.
``Stigmata? Isn't that when people bleed on Good Friday or something?''
``Yes. Sometimes people who believe deeply in Christ's divinity exhibit
bleeding marks on their hands and feet during the Holy Week. It was more common
in the Middle Ages than now. In those days such people were considered blessed
by God. I don't think the Catholic Church proclaimed any of it as out-and-out
miracles, which was pretty smart of them. Stigmata isn't much different from
some of the things the yogis can do. It's better understood now, that's all. The
people who understand the interaction between the mind and the body study it, I
mean, no one understands it -- believe we have a lot more control over our
involuntary functions than they used to think. You can slow your heartbeat if
you think about it enough. Speed up your own metabolism. Make yourself sweat
more. Or make yourself bleed.''
``You think Danny thought those bruises onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) neck? Jack, I just can't
believe that.''
``I can believe it's possible, although it seems unlikely to me, too. What's
more likely is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did it to himself.''
``To himself?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s gone into these `trances' and hurt himself in the past. Do you remember
the time at the supper table? About two years ago, I think. We were super-pissed
at each other. Nobody talking very much. Then, all at once, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes rolled up
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went face-first into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) dinner. Then onto the floor.
Remember?''
``Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. ``I sure do. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was having a convulsion.''
``Another time we were in the park,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>stowaway</b></font>) said. ``Just Danny and I. Saturday
afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was sitting on a swing, coasting back and forth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) collapsed onto
the ground. It was like he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'d been shot. I ran over and picked him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) up and all of
a sudden he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) just came around. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sort of blinked at me and said, `I hurt my
tummy. Tell Mommy to close the bedroom windows if it rains.' And that night it
rained like hell.''
``Yes, but -- ''
``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s always coming in with cuts and scraped elbows. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shins look like a
battlefield in distress. And when you ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) got this one or that one,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) just says `Oh, I was playing,' and that's the end of it.''
``Jack, all kids get bumped and bruised up. With little boys it's almost
constant from the time they learn to walk until they're twelve or thirteen.''
``And I'm sure Danny gets his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) share,'' Jack responded. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s an active kid. But
I remember that day in the park and that night at the supper table. And I wonder
if some of our kid's bumps and bruises come from just keeling over. That Dr.
Edmonds said Danny did it right in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) office, for Christ's sake!''
``All right. But those bruises were fingers. I'd swear to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't get
them falling down.''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) goes into a trance,'' Jack said. ``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sees something that happened in
that room. An argument. Maybe a suicide. Violent emotions. It isn't like
watching a movie; he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s in a highly suggestible state. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s right in the damn
thing. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) subconscious is maybe visualizing whatever happened in a symbolic way

<p/>... as a dead woman who's alive again, zombie, undead, ghoul, you pick your
term.''
``You're giving me goose-bumps,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said thickly.
``I'm giving myself a few. I'm no psychiatrist, but it seems to fit so well.
The walking dead woman as a symbol for dead emotions, dead lives, that just
won't give up and go away ... but because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a subconscious figure, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s
also him (<font color='blue'><b>psychiatrist</b></font>). In the trance state, the conscious Danny is submerged. The
subconscious figure is pulling the strings. So Danny put his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands around his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
own neck and -- ''
``Stop,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. ``I get the picture. I think that's more frightening than
having a stranger creeping around the halls, Jack. You can move away from a
stranger. You can't move away from yourself. You're talking about
schizophrenia.''
``Of a very limited type,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, but a trifle uneasily. ``And of a very
special nature. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) does seem able to read thoughts, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) really does
seem to have precognitive flashes from time to time. I can't think of that as
mental illness no matter how hard I try. We all have schizo deposits in us
anyway. I think as Danny gets older, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'ll get this under control.''
``If you're right, then it's imperative that we get him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) out. Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) has,
this hotel is making it worse.''
``I wouldn't say that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) objected. ``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'d done as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was told, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) never
would have gone up to that room in the first place. It never would have
happened.''
``My God, Jack! Are you implying that being half-strangled was a ... a
fitting punishment for being off limits?''
``No ... no. Of course not. But -- ''
``No buts,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) head violently. ``The truth is, we're
guessing. We don't have any idea when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) might turn a corner and run into one of
those ... air pockets, one-reel horror movies, whatever they are. We have to
get him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) away.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) laughed a little in the darkness. ``Next thing we'll be seeing
things.''
``Don't talk nonsense,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, and in the darkness of the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) saw the
hedge lions bunching around the path, no longer flanking it but guarding it,
hungry November lions. Cold sweat sprang out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) brow.
``You didn't really see anything, did you?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was asking. ``I mean, when you
went up to that room. You didn't see anything?''
The lions were gone. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) saw a pink pastel shower curtain with a dark shape
lounging behind it. The closed door. That muffled, hurried thump, and sounds
after it that might have been running footsteps. The horrible, lurching beat of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own heart as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) struggled with the passkey.
``Nothing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, and that was true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been strung up, not sure of
what was happening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hadn't had a chance to sift through his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) thoughts for a
reasonable explanation concerning the bruises on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) son's neck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been
pretty damn suggestible himself. Hallucinations could sometimes be catching.
``And you haven't changed your mind? About the snowmobile, I mean?''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands clamped into sudden tight fists
-LRB-Stop nagging me! -RRB-
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) sides. ``I said I would, didn't I? I will. Now go to sleep. It's been a

<p/>long hard day.''
``And how,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said. There was a rustle of bedclothes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) turned toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
and kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shoulder. ``I love you, Jack.''
<div class="bookquote">``I love you too,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was only mouthing the words. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands were
still clenched into fists. They felt like rocks on the ends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) arms. The
pulse beat prominently in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) forehead. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hadn't said a word about what was
going to happen to them after they got down, when the party was over. Not one
word. It had been Danny this and Danny that and Jack I'm so scared. Oh yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
was scared of a lot of closet boogeymen and jumping shadows, plenty scared. But
there was no lack of real ones, either. When they got down to Sidewinder they
would arrive with sixty dollars and the clothes they stood up in. Not even a
car. Even if Sidewinder bad a pawnshop, which it didn't, they had nothing to
hock but Wendy's ninety-dollar diamond engagement ring and the Sony AM/FM radio.
A pawnbroker might give them twenty bucks. A kind pawnbroker. There would be no
job, not even part-time or seasonal, except maybe shoveling out driveways for
three dollars a shot. The picture of John Torrance, thirty years old, who had
once published in Esquire and who had harbored dreams -- not at all unreasonable
dreams, he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) felt, of becoming a major American writer during the next decade, with
a shovel from the Sidewinder Western Auto on his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) shoulder, ringing doorbells...
that picture suddenly came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) much more clearly than the hedge lions and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) fists tighter still, feeling the fingernails sink into his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) palms
and draw blood in mystic quarter-moon shapes. John Torrance, standing in line
to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) sixty dollars into food stamps, standing in line again at the
Sidewinder Methodist Church to get donated commodities and dirty looks from the
locals. John Torrance explaining to Al that they'd just had to leave, had to
shut down the boiler, had to leave the Overlook and all it contained open to
vandals or thieves on snow machines because, you see, Al, attendez-vous, Al,
there are ghosts up there and they have it in for my boy. Good-by, Al.. Thoughts
of Chapter Four, Spring Comes for John Torrance. What then? Whatever then? They
might be able to get to the West Coast in the VW, he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) supposed. A new fuel pump
would do it. Fifty miles west of here and it was all downhill, you could damn
near put the bug in neutral and coast to Utah. On to sunny California, land of
oranges and opportunity. A man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sterling record of alcoholism, studentbeating, and ghost-chasing would undoubtedly be able to write his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own ticket.
Anything you like. Custodial engineer -- swamping out Greyhound buses. The
automotive business -- washing cars in a rubber suit. The culinary arts, perhaps,
washing dishes in a diner. Or possibly a more responsible position, such as
pumping gas. A job like that even held the intellectual stimulation of making
change and writing out credit slips. I can give you twenty-five hours a week at
the minimum wage. That was heavy tunes in a year when Wonder bread went for
sixty cents a loaf.
Blood had begun to trickle down from his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) palms. Like stigmata, oh yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>)
squeezed tighter, savaging himself with pain. His (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) wife was asleep beside him (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>),
why not? There were no problems. He (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) had agreed to take her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and Danny away from
the big bad boogeyman and there were no problems. So you see, Al, I thought the
best thing to do would be to
-LRB-kill her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).-RRB-
The thought rose up from nowhere, naked and unadorned. The urge to tumble her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)

<p/>out of bed, naked, bewildered, just beginning to wake up; to pounce on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),
seize her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) neck like the green limb of a young aspen and to throttle her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), thumbs
on windpipe, fingers pressing against the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) spine, jerking her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head up
and ramming it back down against the floorboards, again and again, whamming,
whacking, smashing, crashing. Jitter and jive, baby. Shake, rattle, and roll. He (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
would make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) take her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) medicine. Every drop. Every last bitter drop.
He (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was dimly aware of a muffled noise somewhere, just outside his (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hot and
racing inner world. He (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looked across the room and Danny was thrashing again,
twisting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bed and rumpling the blankets. The boy was moaning deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
throat, a small, caged sound. What nightmare? A purple woman, long dead,
shambling after him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) down twisting hotel corridors? Somehow he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't think so.
Something else chased Danny in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dreams. Something worse.
The bitter lock of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) emotions was broken. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) got out of bed and went across
to the boy, feeling sick and ashamed of himself. It was Danny he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had to think
of, not Wendy, not himself. Only Danny. And no matter what shape he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wrestled the
facts into, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knew in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) heart that Danny must be taken out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) straightened
the boy's blankets and added the quilt from the foot of the bed. Danny had
quieted again now. Jack touched the sleeping forehead
-LRB-what monsters capering just behind that ridge of bone?-RRB-
and found it warm, but not overly so. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was sleeping peacefully again.
Queer.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) got back into bed and tried to sleep. It eluded him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).
It was so unfair that things should turn out this way -- bad luck seemed to
stalk them. They hadn't been able to shake it by coming up here after all. By
the time they arrived in Sidewinder tomorrow afternoon, the golden opportunity
would have evaporated -- gone the way of the blue suede shoe, as an old roommate
of his (<font color='blue'><b>roommate</b></font>) had been wont to say. Consider the difference if they didn't go down, if
they could somehow stick it out. The play would get finished. One way or the
other, he (<font color='blue'><b>roommate</b></font>) would tack an ending onto it. His (<font color='blue'><b>roommate</b></font>) own uncertainty about his (<font color='blue'><b>roommate</b></font>) characters
might add an appealing touch of ambiguity to his (<font color='blue'><b>roommate</b></font>) original ending. Perhaps it
would even make him (<font color='blue'><b>roommate</b></font>) some money, it wasn't impossible. Even lacking that, Al
might well convince the Stovington Board to rehire him (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) would be on pro of
course, maybe for as long as three years, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) could stay sober and keep
writing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) might not have to stay at Stovington for three years. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>)
hadn't cared much for Stovington before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) had felt stifled, buried alive, but
that had been an immature reaction. Furthermore, how much could a man enjoy
teaching when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first three classes with a skull-busting
hangover every second or third day? It wouldn't be that way again. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be
able to handle his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) responsibilities much better. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sure of it.
Somewhere in the midst of that thought, things began to break up and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
drifted down into sleep. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last thought followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down like a sounding
bell:
It seemed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might be able to find peace here. At last. If they would
only let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
***
When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) woke up he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was standing in the bathroom of 217.

<p/>-LRB-been walking in my sleep again -- why? -- no radios to break up here-RRB-
The bathroom light was on, the room behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in darkness. The shower curtain
was drawn around the long claw-footed tub. The bathmat beside it was wrinkled
and wet.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to feel afraid, but the very dreamlike quality of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fear told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
this was not real. Yet that could not contain the fear. So many things at the
Overlook seemed like dreams.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moved across the floor to the tub, not wanting to be helpless to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
feet back.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flung the curtain open.
Lying in the tub, naked, lolling almost weightless in the water, was George
Hatfield, a knife stuck in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) chest. The water around him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) was stained a bright
pink. George's eyes were closed. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) penis floated limply, like kelp.
<div class="bookquote">``George -- ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heard himself say.
At the word, George's eyes snapped open. They were silver, not human eyes at
all. George's hands, fish-white, found the sides of the tub and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pulled
himself up to a sitting position. The knife stuck straight out from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chest,
equidistantly placed between nipples. The wound was lipless.
<div class="bookquote">``You set the timer ahead,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Hatfield/Hatfield</b></font>)</div>silver-eyed George told him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``No, George, I didn't. I -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Hatfield/Hatfield</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't stutter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Hatfield/Hatfield</b></font>)</div>George was standing now, still fixing him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with that inhuman silver glare, but
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mouth had drawn back in a dead and grimacing smile. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) threw one leg over
the porcelained side of the tub. One white and wrinkled foot placed itself on
the bathmat.
<div class="bookquote">``First you tried to run me over on my bike and then you set the timer ahead
and then you tried to stab me to death but I still don't stutter.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Hatfield/Hatfield</b></font>)</div>George was
coming for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands out, the fingers slightly curled. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) smelled moldy and
wet, like leaves that had been rained on.
<div class="bookquote">``It was for your own good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said, backing up. <div class="bookquote">``I set it ahead for your
own good. Furthermore, I happen to know you cheated on your Final Composition.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't cheat ... and I don't stutter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Hatfield/Hatfield</b></font>)</div>George's hands touched his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) neck.
Jack turned and ran, ran with the floating, weightless slowness that is so
common to dreams.
<div class="bookquote">``You did! You did cheat!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) screamed in fear and anger as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) crossed the
darkened bed/sitting room. <div class="bookquote">``I'll prove it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Hatfield/Hatfield</b></font>)</div>George's hands were on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) neck again. Jack's heart swelled with fear until he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
was sure it would burst. And then, at last, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand curled around the doorknob
and it turned under his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) yanked the door open. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) plunged out, not
into the second-floor hallway, but into the basement room beyond the arch. The
cobwebby light was on. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) campchair, stark and geometrical, stood beneath it.
And all around it was a miniature mountain range of boxes and crates and banded
bundles of records and invoices and God knew what. Relief surged through him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I'll find it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heard himself screaming. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) seized a damp and moldering
cardboard box; it split apart in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands, spilling out a waterfall of yellow
flimsies. <div class="bookquote">``It's here somewhere! I will find it!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) plunged his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands deep into
the pile of papers and came up with a dry, papery wasps' nest in one hand and a

<p/>timer in the other. The timer was ticking. Attached to its back was a length of
electrical cord and attached to the other end of the cord was a bundle of
dynamite. <div class="bookquote">``Here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) screamed. <div class="bookquote">``Here, take it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) relief became absolute triumph. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had done more than escape George; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
had conquered. With these talismanic objects in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands, George would never
touch him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) again. George would flee in terror.
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) began to turn so he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could confront George, and that was when George's hands
settled around his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) neck, squeezing, stopping his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) breath, damming up his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
respiration entirely after one final dragging gasp.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't stutter,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Hatfield/Hatfield</b></font>)</div>whispered George from behind him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dropped the wasps' nest and wasps boiled out of it in a furious brown and
yellow wave. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lungs were on fire. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wavering sight fell on the timer and
the sense of triumph returned, along with a cresting wave of righteous wrath.
Instead of connecting the timer to dynamite, the cord ran to the gold knob of a
stout black cane, like the one his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father had carried after the accident with
the milk truck.
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grasped it and the cord parted. The cane felt heavy and right in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands.
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) swung it back over his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shoulder. On the way up it glanced against the wire
from which the light bulb depended and the light began to swing back and forth,
making the room's hooded shadows rock monstrously against the floor and walls.
On the way down the cane struck something much harder. George screamed. The grip
on Jack's throatloosened.
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) tore free of George's grip and whirled. George was on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knees, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head
drooping, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands laced together on top of it. Blood welled through his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
fingers.
<div class="bookquote">``Please,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Hatfield/Hatfield</b></font>)</div>George whispered humbly. <div class="bookquote">``Give me a break, Mr. Torrance,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now you'll take your medicine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack grunted. <div class="bookquote">``Now by God, won't you. Young
pup. Young worthless cur. Now by God, right now. Every drop. Every single damn
drop!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>As the light swayed above him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and the shadows danced and flapped, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) began to
swing the cane, bringing it down again and again, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arm rising and falling
like a machine. George's bloody protecting fingers fell away from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head and
Jack brought the cane down again and again, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) neck and shoulders and
back and arms. Except that the cane was no longer precisely a cane; it seemed to
be a mallet with some kind of brightly striped handle. A mallet with a hard side
and soft side. The business end was clotted with blood and hair. And the flat,
whacking sound of the mallet against flesh had been replaced with a hollow
booming sound, echoing and reverberating. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own voice had taken on this same
quality, bellowing, disembodied. And yet, paradoxically, it sounded weaker,
slurred, petulant ... as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) were drunk.
The figure on its knees slowly raised its head, as if in supplication. There
was not a face, precisely, but only a mask of blood through which eyes peered.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) brought the mallet back for a final whistling downstroke and it was fully
launched before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) saw that the supplicating face below him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was not George's but
Danny's. It was the face of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) son.
<div class="bookquote">``Daddy -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>And then the mallet crashed home, striking Danny right between the eyes,
closing them forever. And something somewhere seemed to be laughing --

<p/>-LRB-! No !-RRB-
***
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) came out of it standing naked over Danny's bed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands empty, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) body
sheened with sweat. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) final scream had only been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) voiced it
again, this time in a whisper.
<div class="bookquote">``No. No, Danny. Never.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went back to bed on legs that had turned to rubber. Wendy was sleeping
deeply. The clock on the nightstand said it was quarter to five. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lay
sleepless until seven, when Danny began to stir awake. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) legs over
the edge of the bed and began to dress. It was time to go downstairs and check
the boiler.

<p/><< 33 >>
THE SNOWMOBILE
Sometime after midnight, while they all slept uneasily, the snow had stopped
after dumping a fresh eight inches on the old crust. The clouds had broken, a
fresh wind had swept them away, and now Jack stood in a dusty ingot of sunlight,
which slanted through the dirty window set into the eastern side of the
equipment shed.
The place was about as long as a freight car, and about as high. It smelled of
grease and oil and gasoline and -- faint, nostalgic smell -- sweet grass. Four power
lawnmowers were ranked like soldiers on review against the south wall, two of
them the riding type that look like small tractors. To their left were posthole
diggers, round-bladed shovels made for doing surgery on the putting green, a
chain saw, the electric hedge-clippers, and a long thin steel pole with a red
flag at the top. Caddy, fetch my ball in under ten seconds and there's a quarter
in it for you. Yes, sir.
Against the eastern wall, where the morning sun slanted in most strongly,
three Ping-Pong tables leaned one against the other like a drunken house of
cards. Their nets had been removed and flopped down from the shelf above. In the
corner was a stack of shuffleboard weights and a roque set -- the wickets banded
together with twists of wire, the brightly painted balls in an egg-carton sort
of thing -LRB-strange hens you have up here, Watson ... yes, and you should see
the animals down on the front lawn, ha-ha-RRB-, and the mallets, two sets of them,
standing in their racks.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) walked over to them, stepping over an old eight-cell battery -LRB-which had
once sat beneath the hood of the hotel truck, no doubt-RRB- and a battery charger
and a pair of J. C. Penney jumper cables coiled between them. He (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) slipped one of

<p/>the short-handled mallets out of the front rack and held it up in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>)
face, like a knight bound for battle saluting his (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) king.
Fragments of his (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) dream -LRB-it was all jumbled now, fading-RRB- recurred, something
about George Hatfield and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) father's cane, just enough to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) uneasy and,
absurdly enough, a trifle guilty about holding a plain old garden-variety roque
mallet. Not that roque was such a common garden-variety game anymore; its more
modern cousin, croquet, was much more popular now ... and a child's version of
the game at that. Roque, however... that must have been quite a game. Jack had
found a mildewed rule book down in the basement, from one of the years in the
early twenties when a North American Roque Tournament had been held at the
Overlook. Quite a game.
-LRB-schizo-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) frowned a little, then smiled. Yes, it was a schizo sort of game at that.
The mallet expressed that perfectly. A soft end and a hard end. A game of
finesse and aim, and a game of raw, bludgeoning power.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) swung the mallet through the air ... whhhoooop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) smiled a little at the
powerful, whistling sound it made. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) replaced it in the rack and turned to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) left. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) saw there made him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) frown again.
The snowmobile sat almost in the middle of the equipment shed, a fairly new
one, and Jack didn't care for its looks at all. Bombardier Skidoo was written on
the side of the engine cowling facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) in black letters which had been raked
backward, presumably to connote speed. The protruding skis were also black.
There was black piping to the right and left of the cowling, what they would
call racing stripes on a sports car. But the actual paintjob was a bright,
sneering yellow, and that was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) didn't like about it. Sitting there in its
shaft of morning sun, yellow body and black piping, black skis and black
upholstered open cockpit, it looked like a monstrous mechanized wasp. When it
was running it would sound like that too. Whining and buzzing and ready to
sting. But then, what else should it look like? It wasn't flying under false
colors, at least. Because after it had done its job, they were going to be
hurting plenty. All of them. By spring the Torrance family would be hurting so
badly that what those wasps had done to Danny's hand would look like a mother's
kisses.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) handkerchief from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) back pocket, wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth with it, and
walked over to the Skidoo. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stood looking down at it, the frown very deep now,
and stuffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) handkerchief back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pocket. Outside a sudden gust of wind
slammed against the equipment shed, making it rock and creak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked out the
window and saw the gust carrying a sheet of sparkling snow crystals toward the
drifted-in rear of the hotel, whirling them high into the hard blue sky.
The wind dropped and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went back to looking at the machine. It was a
disgusting thing, really. You almost expected to see a long, limber stinger
protruding from the rear of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had always disliked the goddam snowmobiles.
They shivered the cathedral silence of winter into a million rattling fragments.
They startled the wildlife. They sent out huge and pollutive clouds of blue and
billowing oilsmoke behind them -- cough, cough, gag, gag, let me breathe. They
were perhaps the final grotesque toy of the unwinding fossil fuel age, given to
ten-year-olds for Christmas.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) remembered a newspaper article he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had read in Stovington, a story datelined

<p/>someplace in Maine. A kid on a snowmobile, barrel-assing up a road he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>)'d never
traveled before at better than thirty miles an hour. Night. His (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) headlight off.
There had been a heavy chain strung between two posts with a NO TRESPASSING sign
hung from the middle. They said that in all probability the kid never saw it.
The moon might have gone behind a cloud. The chain had decapitated him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>). Reading
the story Jack had been almost glad, and now, looking down at this machine, the
feeling recurred.
-LRB-If it wasn't for Danny, I would take great pleasure in grabbing one of those
mallets, opening the cowling, and just pounding until-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pent-up breath escape him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) in a long slow sigh. Wendy was right.
Come hell, high water, or the welfare line, Wendy was right. Pounding this
machine to death would be the height of folly, no matter how pleasant an aspect
that folly made. It would almost be tantamount to pounding his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) own son to death.
<div class="bookquote">``Fucking Luddite,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said aloud.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went to the back of the machine and unscrewed the gascap. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) found a
dipstick on one of the shelves that ran at chest-height around the walls and
slipped it in. The last eighth of an inch came out wet. Not very much, but
enough to see if the damn thing would run. Later he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could siphon more from the
Volks and the hotel truck.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) screwed the cap back on and opened the cowling. No sparkplugs, no battery.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went to the shelf again and began to poke along it, pushing aside
screwdrivers and adjustable wrenches, a one-lung carburetor that had been taken
out of an old lawnmower, plastic boxes of screws and nails and bolts of varying
sizes. The shelf was thick and dark with old grease, and the years' accumulation
of dust had stuck to it like fur. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't like touching it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) found a small, oil-stained box with the abbreviation Skid. laconically
marked on it in pencil. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shook it and something rattled inside. Plugs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) held
one of them up to the light, trying to estimate the gap without hunting around
for the gapping tool. Fuck it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thought resentfully, and dropped the plug back
into the box. If the gap's wrong, that's just too damn bad. Tough fucking titty.
There was a stool behind the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) dragged it over, sat down, and installed
the four sparkplugs, then fitted the small rubber caps over each. That done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
let his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fingers play briefly over the magneto. They laughed when I sat down at
the piano.
Back to the shelves. This time he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) couldn't find what he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wanted, a small
battery. A three- or four-cell. There were socket wrenches, a case filled with
drills and drillbits, bags of lawn fertilizer and Vigoro for the flower beds,
but no snowmobile battery. It didn't bother him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) in the slightest. In fact, it
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) feel glad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was relieved. I did my best, Captain, but I could not get
through. That's fine, son. I'm going to put you in for the Silver Star and the
Purple Snowmobile. You're a credit to your regiment. Thank you, sir. I did try.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) began to whistle <div class="bookquote">``Red River Valley''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>uptempo as he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) poked along the last two
or three feet of shelf. The notes came out in little puffs of white smoke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>)
had made a complete circuit of the shed and the thing wasn't there. Maybe
somebody had lifted it. Maybe Watson had. He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) laughed aloud. The old office
bootleg trick. A few paperclips, a couple of reams of paper, nobody will miss
this tablecloth or this Golden Regal place setting ... and what about this
fine snowmobile battery? Yes, that might come in handy. Toss it in the sack.

<p/>White-collar crime, Baby. Everybody has sticky fingers. Under-the-jacket
discount, we used to call it when we were kids.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) walked back to the snowmobile and gave the side of it a good healthy kick
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) went by. Well, that was the end of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) would just have to tell Wendy
sorry, baby, but --
There was a box sitting in the corner by the door. The stool bad been right
over it. Written on the top, in pencil, was the abbreviation Skid.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) looked at it, the smile drying up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) lips. Look, sir, it's the cavalry.
Looks like your smoke signals must have worked after all.
It wasn't fair.
Goddammit, it just wasn't fair.
Something -- luck, fate, providence -- had been trying to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>). Some other
luck, white luck. And at the last moment bad old Jack Torrance luck had stepped
back in. The lousy run of cards wasn't over yet.
Resentment, a gray, sullen wave of it, pushed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) throat. His (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) hands had
clenched into fists again.
-LRB-Not fair, goddammit, not fair!-RRB-
Why couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) have looked someplace else? Anyplace! Why hadn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had a
crick in his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) neck or an itch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) nose or the need to blink? Just one of those
little things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) never would have seen it.
Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) hadn't. That was all. It was an hallucination, no different from what
had happened yesterday outside that room on the second floor or the goddam hedge
menagerie. A momentary strain, that was all. Fancy, I thought I saw a snowmobile
battery in that corner. Nothing there now. Combat fatigue, I guess, sir. Sorry.
Keep your pecker up, son. It happens to all of us sooner or later.
He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) yanked the door open almost hard enough to snap the hinges and pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
snowshoes inside. They were clotted with snow and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) slapped them down hard
enough on the floor to raise a cloud of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) left foot on the left
shoe ... and paused.
Danny was out there, by the milk platform. Trying to make a snowman, by the
looks. Not much luck; the snow was too cold to stick together. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was
giving it the old college try, out there in the flashing morning, a speck of a
bundled-up boy above the brilliant snow and below the brilliant sky. Wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
hat turned around backward like Carlton Fiske.
-LRB-What in the name of God were you thinking of?-RRB-
The answer came back with no pause.
-LRB-Me. I was thinking of me.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) suddenly remembered lying in bed the night before, lying there and suddenly
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been contemplating the murder of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife.
In that instant, kneeling there, everything came clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). It was not just
Danny the Overlook was working on. It was working on him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), too. It wasn't Danny
who was the weak link, it was him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was the vulnerable one, the one who could
be bent and twisted until something snapped.
-LRB-until i let go and sleep ... and when i do that if i do that-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked up at the banks of windows and the sun threw back an almost blinding
glare from their many-paned surfaces but he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked anyway. For the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
noticed how much they seemed like eyes. They reflected away the sun and held
their own darkness within. It was not Danny they were looking at. It was him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).

<p/>In those few seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) understood everything. There was a certain black-andwhite picture he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) remembered seeing as a child, in catechism class. The nun had
presented it to them on an easel and called it a miracle of God. The class had
looked at it blankly, seeing nothing but a jumble of whites and blacks,
senseless and patternless Then one of the children in the third row had gasped,
<div class="bookquote">``It's Jesus!''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>and that child had gone home with a brand-new Testament and also a
calendar because he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been first. The others stared even harder, Jacky
Torrance among them. One by one the other kids had given a similar gasp, one
little girl transported in near-ecstasy, crying out shrilly: <div class="bookquote">``I see Him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)! I see
Him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had also been rewarded with a Testament. At last everyone had seen the
face of Jesus in the jumble of blacks and whites except Jacky. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) strained
harder and harder, scared now, part of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) cynically thinking that everyone else
was simply putting on to please Sister Beatrice, part of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) secretly convinced
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) wasn't seeing it because God had decided he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was the worst sinner in the
class. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you see it, Jacky?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sister</b></font>)</div>Sister Beatrice had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) sad,
sweet manner. I see your tits, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had thought in vicious desperation. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) began
to shake his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head, then faked excitement and said: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do! Wow! It is Jesus! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And everyone in class had laughed and applauded him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), making him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) feel
triumphant, ashamed, and scared. Later, when everyone else had tumbled their way
up from the church basement and out onto the street he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had lingered behind,
looking at the meaningless black-and-white jumble that Sister Beatrice had left
on the easel. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hated it. They had all made it up the way he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had, even Sister
herself. It was a big fake. <div class="bookquote">``Shitfire-hellfire-shitfire,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had whispered under
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) breath, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) turned to go he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bad seen the face of Jesus from the corner
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) eye, sad and. wise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) turned back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) heart in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) throat. Everything
had suddenly clicked into place and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) had stared at the picture with fearful
wonder, unable to believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) had missed it. The eyes, the zigzag of shadow
across the care-worn brow, the fine nose, the compassionate lips. Looking at
Jack Torrance. What had only been a meaningless sprawl had suddenly been
transformed into a stark black-and-white etching of the face of Christ Our Lord.
Fearful wonder became terror. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had cussed in front of a picture of Jesus. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)
would be damned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) would be in hell with the sinners. The face of Christ had
been in the picture all along. All along.
Now, kneeling in the sun and watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) son playing in the shadow of the
hotel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) knew that it was all true. The hotel wanted Danny, maybe all of them
but Danny for sure. The hedges had really walked. There was a dead woman in 217,
a woman that was perhaps only a spirit and harmless under most circumstances,
but a woman who was now an active danger. Like some malevolent clockwork toy she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had been wound up and set in motion by Danny's own odd mind ... and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) own.
Had it been Watson who had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) a man had dropped dead of a stroke one day
on the roque court? Or had it been Ullman? It didn't matter. There had been an
assassination on the third floor. How many old quarrels, suicides, strokes? How
many murders? Was Grady lurking somewhere in the west wing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) ax, just
waiting for Danny to start him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) up so he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could come back out of the woodwork?
The puffed circle of bruises around Danny's neck.
The twinkling, half-seen bottles in the deserted lounge.
The radio.
The dreams.

<p/>The scrapbook he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had found in the cellar.
-LRB-Medoc, are you here? I've been sleepwalking again, my dear...-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) got up suddenly, thrusting the snowshoes back out the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was shaking
all over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) slammed the door and picked up the box with the battery in it. It
slipped through his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shaking fingers
-LRB-oh christ what if i cracked it-RRB-
and thumped over on its side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pulled the flaps of the carton open and
yanked the battery out, heedless of the acid that might be leaking through the
battery's casing if it had cracked. But it hadn't. It was whole. A little sigh
escaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) lips.
Cradling it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) took it over to the Skidoo and put it on its platform near the
front of the engine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) found a small adjustable wrench on one of the shelves
and attached the battery cables quickly and with no trouble. The battery was
live; no need to use the charger on it. There had been a crackle of electricity
and a small odor of ozone when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) slipped the positive cable onto its terminal.
The job done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stood away, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands nervously on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) faded denim
jacket. There. It should work. No reason why not. No reason at all except that
it was part of the Overlook and the Overlook really didn't want them out of
here. Not at all. The Overlook was having one hell of a good time. There was a
little boy to terrorize a man and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) woman to set one against the other, and if
it played its cards right they could end up flitting through the Overlook's
halls like insubstantial shades in a Shirley Jackson novel, whatever walked in
Hill House walked alone, but you wouldn't be alone in the Overlook, oh no, there
would be plenty of company here. But there was really no reason why the
snowmobile shouldn't start. Except of course
-LRB-Except he (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) still didn't really want to go.-RRB-
yes, except for that.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) stood looking at the Skidoo, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) breath puffing out in frozen little
plumes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) wanted it to be the way it had been. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) had come in here he (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>)'d
had no doubts. Going down would be the wrong decision, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) had known that then.
Wendy was only scared of the boogeyman summoned up by a single hysterical little
boy. Now suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) side. It was like his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) play, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) damnable
play. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) no longer knew which side he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was on, or how things should come out.
Once you saw the face of a god in those jumbled blacks and whites, it was
everybody out of the pool -- you could never unsee it. Others might laugh and say
it's nothing, just a lot of splotches with no meaning, give me a good old Craftmaster paint-by-the-numbers any day, but you would always see the face of
Christ-Our-Lord looking out at you. You had seen it in one gestalt leap, the
conscious and unconscious melding in that one shocking moment of understanding.
You would always see it. You were damned to always see it.
-LRB-I've been sleepwalking again, my dear ...-RRB-
It had been all right until he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had seen Danny playing in the snow. It was
Danny's fault. Everything had been Danny's fault. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was the one with the
shining, or whatever it was. It wasn't a shining. It was a curse. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and
Wendy had been here alone, they could have passed the winter quite nicely. No
pain, no strain on the brain.
-LRB-Don't want to leave. ?Can't?-RRB-
The Overlook didn't want them to go and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't want them to go either. Not

<p/>even Danny. Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was a part of it, now. Perhaps the Overlook, large and
rambling Samuel Johnson that it was, had picked him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) to be its Boswell. You say
the new caretaker writes? Very good, sign him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) on. Time we told our side. Let's
get rid of the woman and his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) snotnosed kid first, however. We don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) to
be distracted. We don't --
He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) was standing by the snowmobile's cockpit, his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) head starting to ache again.
What did it come down to? Go or stay. Very simple. Keep it simple. Shall we go
or shall we stay?
If we go, how long will it be before you find the local hole in Sidewinder? a
voice inside him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) asked. The dark place with the lousy color TV that unshaven and
unemployed men spend the day watching game shows on? Where the piss in the men's
room smells two thousand years old and there's always a sodden Camel butt
unraveling in the toilet bowl? Where the beer is thirty cents a glass and you
cut it with salt and the jukebox is loaded with seventy country oldies?
How long? Oh Christ, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was so afraid it wouldn't be long at all.
<div class="bookquote">``I can't win,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) said, very softly. That was it. It was like trying to play
solitaire with one of the aces missing from the deck.
Abruptly he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) leaned over the Skidoo's motor compartment and yanked off the
magneto. It came off with sickening ease. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) looked at it for a moment, then
went to the equipment shed's back door and opened it.
From here the view of the mountains was unobstructed, picture-postcard
beautiful in the twinkling brightness of morning. An unbroken field of snow rose
to the first pines about a mile distant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) flung the magneto as far out into
the snow as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) could. It went much further than it should have. There was a
light puff of snow when it fell. The light breeze carried the snow granules away
to fresh resting places. Disperse there, I say. There's nothing to see. It's all
over. Disperse.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) felt at peace.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) stood in the doorway for a long time, breathing the good mountain air, and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) closed it firmly and went back out the other door to tell Wendy they
would be staying. On the way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) stopped and had a snowball fight with Danny.

<p/><< 34 >>
THE HEDGES
It was November 29, three days after Thanksgiving. The last week had been a
good one, the Thanksgiving dinner the best they'd ever had as a family. Wendy
had cooked Dick Hallorann's turkey to a turn and they had all eaten to bursting
without even coming close to demolishing the jolly bird. Jack had groaned that
they would be eating turkey for the rest of the winter -- creamed turkey, turkey
sandwiches, turkey and noodles, turkey surprise.

<p/>No, Wendy told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) with a little smile. Only until Christmas. Then we have the
capon.
Jack and Danny groaned together.
The bruises on Danny's neck had faded, and their fears seemed to have faded
with them. On Thanksgiving afternoon Wendy had been pulling Danny around on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
sled while Jack worked on the play, which was now almost done.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you still afraid, doc?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had asked, not knowing bow to put the
question less baldly.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) answered simply. <div class="bookquote">``But now I stay in the safe places.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your daddy says that sooner or later the forest rangers will wonder why we're
not checking in on the CB radio. They'll come to see if anything is wrong. We
might go down then. You and I. And let your daddy finish the winter. He (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) has good
reasons for wanting to. In a way, doc ... I know this is hard for you to
understand ... our backs are against the wall.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had answered noncommittally.
On this sparkling afternoon the two of them were upstairs, and Danny knew that
they had been making love. They were dozing now. They were happy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knew. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
mother was still a little bit afraid, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father's attitude was strange. It
was a feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had done something that was very hard and had done it
right. But Danny could not seem to see exactly what the something was. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
father was guarding that carefully, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own mind. Was it possible, Danny
wondered, to be glad you had done something and still be so ashamed of that
something that you tried not to think of it? The question was a disturbing one.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't think such a thing was possible ... in a normal mind. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hardest
probings at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father had only brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) a dim picture of something like an
octopus, whirling up into the hard blue sky. And on both occasions that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had
concentrated hard enough to get this, Daddy had suddenly been staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) in
a sharp and frightening way, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knew what Danny was doing.
Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was in the lobby, getting ready to go out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went out a lot, taking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sled or wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) snowshoes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) liked to get out of the hotel. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was
out in the sunshine, it seemed like a weight had slipped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shoulders.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pulled a chair over, stood on it, and got his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) parka and snow pants out of
the ballroom closet, and then sat down on the chair to put them on. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) boots
were in the boot box and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pulled them on, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tongue creeping out into the
corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth in concentration as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) laced them and tied the rawhide into
careful granny knots. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pulled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mittens and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ski mask and was ready.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tramped out through the kitchen to the back door, then paused. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was tired
of playing out back, and at this time of day the hotel's shadow would be cast
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) play area. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't even like being in the Overlook's shadow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
decided be would put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) snowshoes and go down to the playground instead.
Dick Hallorann had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) to stay away from the topiary, but the thought of
the hedge animals did not bother him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) much. They were buried under snowdrifts
now, nothing showing but a vague hump that was the rabbit's head and the lions'
tails. Sticking out of the snow the way they were, the tails looked more absurd
than frightening.
Danny opened the back door and got his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) snowshoes from the milk platform. Five
minutes later he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was strapping them to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) feet on the front porch. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy
had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) -LRB-Danny-RRB- had the hang of using the snowshoes -- the lazy,

<p/>shuffling stride, the twist of ankle that shook the powdery snow from the
lacings just before the boot came back down -- and all that remained was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) to
build up the necessary muscles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thighs and calves and ankles. Danny found
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ankles got tired the fastest. Snowshoeing was almost as hard on your
ankles as skating, because you had to keep clearing the lacings. Every five
minutes or so he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had to stop with his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) legs spread and the snowshoes fat on the
snow to rest them.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't have to rest on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) way down to the playground because it was
all downhill. Less than ten minutes after he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) struggled up and over the monstrous
snow-dune that had drifted in on the Overlook's front porch he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was standing with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mittened hand on the playground slide. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wasn't even breathing hard.
The playground seemed much nicer in the deep snow than it ever had during the
autumn. It looked like a fairyland sculpture. The swing chains had been frozen
in strange positions, the seats of the big kids' swings resting flush against
the snow. The jungle gym was an ice-cave guarded by dripping icicle teeth. Only
the chimneys of the play-Overlook stuck up over the snow
-LRB-wish the other one was buried that way only not with us in it-RRB-
and the tops of the cement rings protruded in two places like Eskimo igloos.
Danny tramped over there, squatted, and began to dig. Before long he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had
uncovered the dark mouth of one of them and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) slipped into the cold tunnel. In
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was Patrick McGoohan, the Secret Agent Man -LRB-they had shown the
reruns of that program twice on the Burlington TV channel and his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) daddy never
missed them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) would skip a party to stay home and watch <div class="bookquote">``Secret Agent''  (<font color='red'><b>a party home</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``The
Avengers''  (<font color='red'><b>a party home</b></font>)</div>and Danny had always watched with him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)-RRB-, on the run from KGB agents in
the mountains of Switzerland. There had been avalanches in the area and the
notorious KGB agent Slobbo had killed his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) girlfriend with a poison dart, but
somewhere near was the Russian antigravity machine. Perhaps at the end of this
very tunnel. He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) automatic and went along the concrete tunnel, his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) eyes
wide and alert, his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) breath pluming out.
The far end of the concrete ring was solidly blocked with snow. He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) tried
digging through it and was amazed -LRB-and a little uneasy-RRB- to see how solid it was,
almost like ice from the cold and the constant weight of more snow on top of it.
His (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) make-believe game collapsed around him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) was suddenly aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>)
felt closed in and extremely nervous in this tight ring of cement. He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) could hear
his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) breathing; it sounded dank and quick and hollow. He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) was under the snow, and
hardly any light filtered down the hole he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) had dug to get in here. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>)
wanted to be out in the sunlight more than anything, suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>)
daddy and mommy were sleeping and didn't know there he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) was, that if the hole he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>)
dug caved in he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) would be trapped, and the Overlook didn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>).
Danny got turned around with some difficulty and crawled back along the length
of the concrete ring, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) snowshoes clacking woodenly together behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
palms crackling in last fall's dead aspen leaves beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had just
reached the end and the cold spill of light coming down from above when the snow
did give in, a minor fall, but enough to powder his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face and clog the opening he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
had wriggled down through and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) in darkness.
For a moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) brain froze in utter panic and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could not think. Then, as
if from far off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) must never play at the
Stovington dump, because sometimes stupid people hauled old refrigerators off to

<p/>the dump without removing the doors and if you got in one and the door happened
to shut on you, there was no way to get out. You would die in the darkness.
-LRB-You wouldn't want a thing like that to happen to you, would you, doc?-RRB-
-LRB-No, Daddy.-RRB-
But it had happened, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) frenzied mind told him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), it had happened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was in
the dark, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was closed in, and it was as cold as a refrigerator. And --
-LRB-something is in here with me.-RRB-
His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) breath stopped in a gasp. An almost drowsy terror stole through his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) veins.
Yes. Yes. There was something in here with him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), some awful thing the Overlook
had saved for just such a chance as this. Maybe a huge spider that had burrowed
down under the dead leaves, or a rat ... or maybe the corpse of some little
kid that had died here on the playground. Had that ever happened? Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>)
thought maybe it had. He (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) thought of the woman in the tub. The blood and brains
on the wall of the Presidential Sweet. Of some little kid, its head split open
from a fall from the monkey bars or a swing, crawling after him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) in the dark,
grinning, looking for one final playmate in its endless playground. Forever. In
a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) would hear it coming.
At the far end of the concrete ring, Danny heard the stealthy crackle of dead
leaves as something came for him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) on its hands and knees. At any moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would
feel its cold hand close over his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ankle --
That thought broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) paralysis. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was digging at the loose fall of snow
that choked the end of the concrete ring, throwing it back between his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) legs in
powdery bursts like a dog digging for a bone. Blue light filtered down from
above and Danny thrust himself up at it like a diver coming out of deep water.
He (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) scraped his (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) back on the lip of the concrete ring. One of his (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) snowshoes
twisted behind the other. Snow spilled down inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) ski mask and into the
collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) parka. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) dug at the snow, clawed at it. It seemed to be trying to
hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>), to suck him (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) back down, back into the concrete ring where that unseen,
leaf-crackling thing was, and keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) there. Forever.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) was out, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) face was turned up to the sun, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) was crawling
through the snow, crawling away from the half-buried cement ring, gasping
harshly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) face almost comically white with powdered snow -- a living frightmask. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) hobbled over to the jungle gym and sat down to readjust his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) snowshoes
and get his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) breath. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) set them to rights and tightened the straps again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>)
never took his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) eyes from the hole at the end of the concrete ring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) waited to
see if something would come out. Nothing did, and after three or four minutes,
Danny's breathing began to slow down. Whatever it was, it couldn't stand the
sunlight. It was cooped up down there, maybe only able to come out when it was
dark... or when both ends of its circular prison were plugged with snow.
-LRB-but i'm safe now i'm safe i'll just go back because now i'm -RRB-
Something thumped softly behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) turned around, toward the hotel, and looked. But even before he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked
-LRB-Can you see the Indians in this picture?-RRB-
he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would see, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knew what that soft thumping sound had
been. It was the sound of a large clump of snow falling, the way it sounded when
it slid off the roof of the hotel and fell to the ground.
-LRB-Can you see -- ?-RRB-
Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could. The snow had fallen off the hedge dog. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) came down it had

<p/>only been a harmless lump of snow outside the playground. Now it stood revealed,
an incongruous splash of green in all the eye-watering whiteness. It was sitting
up, as if to beg a sweet or a scrap.
But this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wouldn't go crazy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wouldn't blow his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) cool. Because at
least he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wasn't trapped in some dark old hole. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was in the sunlight. And it
was just a dog. It's pretty warm out today, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thought hopefully. Maybe the sun
just melted enough snow off that old dog so the rest fell off in a bunch. Maybe
that's all it is.
-LRB-Don't go near that place ... steer right clear.-RRB-
His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) snowshoe bindings were as tight as they were ever going to be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stood up
and stared back at the concrete ring, almost completely submerged in the snow,
and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) saw at the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had exited from froze his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) heart. There was a
circular patch of darkness at the end of it, a fold of shadow that marked the
hole he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'d dug to get down inside. Now, in spite of the snow-dazzle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could see something there. Something moving. A hand. The waving hand of some
desperately unhappy child, waving hand, pleading hand, drowning hand.
-LRB-Save me O please save me If you can't save me at least come play with me...
Forever. And Forever. And Forever.-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny whispered huskily. The word fell dry and bare from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth,
which was stripped of moisture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind wavering now, trying to
go away the way it had when the woman in the room had ... no, better not think
of that.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) grasped at the strings of reality and held them tightly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had to get out
of here. Concentrate on that. Be cool. Be like the Secret Agent Man. Would
Patrick McGoohan be crying and peeing in his (<font color='blue'><b>McGoohan</b></font>) pants like a little baby?
Would his (<font color='blue'><b>McGoohan</b></font>) daddy?
That calmed him (<font color='blue'><b>McGoohan</b></font>) somewhat.
From behind him (<font color='blue'><b>McGoohan</b></font>), that soft Hump sound of falling snow came again. He (<font color='blue'><b>McGoohan</b></font>) turned
around and the head of one of the hedge lions was sticking out of the snow now,
snarling at him (<font color='blue'><b>McGoohan</b></font>). It was closer than it should have been, almost up to the gate
of the playground.
Terror tried to rise up and he (<font color='blue'><b>McGoohan</b></font>) quelled it. He (<font color='blue'><b>McGoohan</b></font>) was the Secret Agent Man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>)
would escape.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) began to walk out of the playground, taking the same roundabout course his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>)
father had taken on the day that the snow flew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) concentrated on operating the
snowshoes. Slow, flat strides. Don't lift your foot too high or you'll lose your
balance. Twist your ankle and spill the snow off the crisscrossed lacings. It
seemed so slow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) reached the corner of the playground. The snow was drifted
high here and he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) was able to step over the fence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) got halfway over and then
almost fell flat when the snowshoe on his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) behind foot caught on one of the fence
posts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) leaned on the outside edge of gravity, pinwheeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) arms,
remembering how hard it was to get up once you fell down.
From his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) right, that soft sound again, falling clumps of snow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) looked over
and saw the other two lions, clear of snow now down to their forepaws, side by
side, about sixty paces away. The green indentations that were their eyes were
fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>). The dog had turned its head.
-LRB-It only happens when you're not looking.-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``Oh! Hey -- ''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) snowshoes had crossed and he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) plunged forward into the snow, arms waving
uselessly. More snow got inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) hood and down his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) neck and into the tops of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) boots. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) struggled out of the snow and tried to get the snowshoes under
him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>), heart hammering crazily now
-LRB-Secret Agent Man remember you're the Secret Agent-RRB-
and overbalanced backward. For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Agent</b></font>) lay there looking at the sky,
thinking it would be simpler to just give up.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Agent</b></font>) thought of the thing in the concrete tunnel and knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Agent</b></font>) could not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Agent</b></font>)
gained his (<font color='blue'><b>Agent</b></font>) feet and stared over at the topiary. All three lions were bunched
together now, not forty feet away. The dog had ranged off to their left, as if
to block Danny's retreat. They were bare of snow except for powdery ruffs around
their necks and muzzles. They were all staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) breath was racing now, and the panic was like a rat behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) forehead,
twisting and gnawing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fought the panic and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fought the snowshoes.
-LRB-Daddy's voice: No, don't fight them, doc. Walk on them like they were your
own feet. Walk with them.-RRB-
-LRB-Yes, Daddy.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) began to walk again, trying to regain the easy rhythm he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had practiced with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy. Little by little it began to come, but with the rhythm came an
awareness of just how tired he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was, how much his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fear had exhausted him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). The
tendons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thighs and calves and ankles were hot and trembly. Ahead he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could
see the Overlook, mockingly distant, seeming to stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) with its many
windows, as if this were some sort of contest in which it was mildly interested.
Danny looked back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shoulder and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hurried breathing caught for a
moment and then hurried on even faster. The nearest lion was now only twenty
feet behind, breasting through the snow like a dog paddling in a pond. The two
others were to its right and left, pacing it. They were like an army platoon on
patrol, the dog, still off to their left, the scout. The closest lion had its
head down. The shoulders bunched powerfully above its neck. The tail was up, as
if in the instant before he (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) had turned to look it had been swishing back and
forth, back and forth. He (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) thought it looked like a great big housecat that was
having a good time playing with a mouse before killing it.
-LRB- -- falling -- -RRB-
No, if he (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) fell he (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) was dead. They would never let him (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) get up. They would
pounce. He (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) pinwheeled his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) arms madly and lunged ahead, his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) center of gravity
dancing just beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) nose. He (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) caught it and hurried on, snapping glances back
over his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) shoulder. The air whistled in and out of his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) dry throat like hot glass.
The world closed down to the dazzling snow, the green hedges, and the whispery
sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) snowshoes. And something else. A soft, muffled padding sound. He (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>)
tried to hurry faster and couldn't. He (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) was walking over the buried driveway now,
a small boy with his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) face almost buried in the shadow of his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) parka hood. The
afternoon was still and bright.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) looked back again, the point lion was only five feet behind. It was
grinning. Its mouth was open, its haunches tensed down like a clockspring.
Behind it and the others he (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) could see the rabbit, its head now sticking out of
the snow, bright green, as if it had turned its horrid blank face to watch the
end of the stalk.
Now, on the Overlook's front lawn between the circular drive and the porch, he (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>)

<p/>let the panic loose and began to run clumsily in the snowshoes, not daring to
look back now, tilting further and further forward, his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) arms out ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>)
like a blind man feeling for obstacles. His (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) hood fell back, revealing his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>)
complexion, paste white giving way to hectic red blotches on his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) cheeks, his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>)
eyes bulging with terror. The porch was very close now.
Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) heard the sudden hard crunch of snow as something leaped.
He (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) fell on the porch steps, screaming without sound, and scrambled up them on
his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) hands and knees, snowshoes clattering and askew behind him (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>).
There was a slashing sound in the air and sudden pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) leg. The ripping
sound of cloth. Something else that might have -- must have -- been in his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) mind.
Bellowing, angry roar.
Smell of blood and evergreen.
He (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) fell full-length on the porch, sobbing hoarsely, the rich, metallic taste
of copper in his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) mouth. His (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) heart was thundering in his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) chest. There was a small
trickle of blood coming from his (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) nose.
He (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) had no idea how long he (<font color='blue'><b>scout</b></font>) lay there before the lobby doors flew open and Jack
ran out, wearing just his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) jeans and a pair of slippers. Wendy was behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Danny!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) screamed.
<div class="bookquote">``Doc! Danny, for Christ's sake! What's wrong? What happened?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Daddy was helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) up. Below the knee his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) snowpants were ripped open.
Inside, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) woollen ski sock had been ripped open and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) calf had been
shallowly scratched ... as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had tried to push his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) way through a closely
grown evergreen hedge and the branches had clawed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shoulder. Far down the lawn, past the putting green, were a
number of vague, snow-cowled humps. The hedge animals. Between them and the
playground. Between them and the road.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) legs gave way. Jack caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) began to cry.

<p/><< 35 >>
THE LOBBY
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had told them everything except what had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) when the snow had
blocked the end of the concrete ring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) couldn't bring himself to repeat that.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) didn't know the right words to express the creeping, lassitudinous sense
of terror he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had felt when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heard the dead aspen leaves begin to crackle
furtively down there in the cold darkness. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) told them about the soft sound
of snow falling in clumps. About the lion with its head and its bunched
shoulders working its way up and out of the snow to chase him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) even told them
about how the rabbit had turned its head to watch near the end.
The three of them were in the lobby. Jack had built a roaring blaze in the
fireplace. Danny was bundled up in a blanket on the small sofa where once, a

<p/>million years ago, three nuns had sat laughing like girls while they waited for
the line at the desk to thin out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was sipping hot noodle soup from a mug.
Wendy sat beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hair. Jack had sat on the floor, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face
seeming to grow more and more still, more and more set as Danny told his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) story.
Twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) handkerchief out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) back pocket and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
sorelooking lips with it.
<div class="bookquote">``Then they chased me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) finished. Jack got up and went over to the window,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) back to them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mommy. <div class="bookquote">``They chased me all the way up to the
porch.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was struggling to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) voice calm, because if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stayed calm
maybe they would believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). Mr. Stenger hadn't stayed calm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) had started to
cry and hadn't been able to stop SO THE MEN IN THE WHITE COATS had come to take
him (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) away because if you couldn't stop crying it meant you had LOST YOUR MARBLES
and when would you be back? NO ONE KNOWS. His (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) parka and snowpants and the
clotted snowshoes lay on the rug just inside the big double doors.
-LRB-I won't cry I won't let myself cry-RRB-
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) could do that, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) couldn't stop shaking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stenger</b></font>) looked into
the fire and waited for Daddy to say something. High yellow flames danced on the
dark stone hearth. A pine-knot exploded with a bang and sparks rushed up the
flue.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny, come over here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack turned around. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face still had that pinched,
deathly look. Danny didn't like to look at it.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I just want the boy over here for a minute.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny slipped off the sofa and came over beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy.
<div class="bookquote">``Good boy. Now what do you see?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny had known what he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would see even before he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) got to the window. Below the
clutter of boot tracks, sled tracks, and snowshoe tracks that marked their usual
exercise area, the snowfield that covered the Overlook's lawns sloped down to
the topiary and the playground beyond. It was marred by two sets of tracks, one
of them in a straight line from the porch to the playground, the other a long,
looping line coming back up.
<div class="bookquote">``Only my tracks, Daddy. But -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What about the hedges, Danny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny's lips began to tremble. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was going to cry. What if he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) couldn't stop?
-LRB-i won't cry I Won't Cry Won't Won't WON'T-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``All covered with snow,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``But, Daddy -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What? I couldn't hear you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jack, you're cross-examining him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)! Can't you see he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s upset, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s -- ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You must have cut your leg on the crust of the snow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Then Wendy was between them, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face pale and angry. <div class="bookquote">``What are you trying to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Confess to murder? What's wrong with you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The strangeness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes seemed to break then. <div class="bookquote">``I'm trying to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) find
the difference between something real and something that was only an
hallucination, that's all.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) squatted by Danny so they were on an eye-to-eye
level, and then hugged him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tight. <div class="bookquote">``Danny, it didn't really happen. Okay? It was
like one of those trances you have sometimes. That's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Daddy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What, Dan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I didn't cut my leg on the crust. There isn't any crust. It's all powdery
snow. It won't even stick together to make snowballs. Remember we tried to have
a snowball fight and couldn't?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father stiffen against him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The porch step, then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny pulled away. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had it. It had flashed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind all at
once, the way things sometimes did, the way it had about the woman wanting to be
in that gray man's pants. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stared at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father with widening eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``You know I'm telling the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whispered, shocked.
``Danny -- ``Jack's face, tightening.
<div class="bookquote">``You know because you saw -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>The sound of Jack's open palm striking Danny's face was flat, not dramatic at
all. The boy's head rocked back, the palmprint reddening on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) cheek like a
brand.
Wendy made a moaning noise.
For a moment they were still, the three of them, and then Jack grabbed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
son and said, <div class="bookquote">``Danny, I'm sorry, you okay, doc?''
 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), you bastardl''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy cried. <div class="bookquote">``You dirty bastard!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) grabbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) other arm and for a moment Danny was pulled between them.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh please stop pulling me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) screamed at them, and there was such agony in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) voice that they both let go of him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), and then the tears had to come and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
collapsed, weeping, between the sofa and the window, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) parents staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
helplessly, the way children might stare at a toy broken in a furious tussle
over to whom it belonged. In the fireplace another pine-knot exploded like a
hand grenade, making them all jump.
***
Wendy gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) baby aspirin and Jack slipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), unprotesting, between the
sheets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) cot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was asleep in no time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) thumb in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's a regression.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack didn't reply.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) softly, without anger, without a smile, either. ``You want me
to apologize for calling you a bastard? All right, I apologize. I'm sorry. You
still shouldn't have hit him (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>).
``I know,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) muttered. ``I know that. I don't know what the hell came over me.''
``You promised you'd never hit him (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) again.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) furiously, and then the fury collapsed. Suddenly, with pity
and horror, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw what Jack would look like as an old man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had never seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) look that way before.
-LRB-?what way?-RRB-
Defeated, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) answered herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) looks beaten.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said: ``I always thought I could keep my promises.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) arm. ``All right, it's over. And when
the ranger comes to check us, we'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>ranger</b></font>) we all want to go down. All right?''
<div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Jack said, and at that moment, at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) meant it. The same
way he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had always meant it on those mornings after, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pale and

<p/>haggard face in the bathroom mirror. I'm going to stop, going to cut it off
flat. But morning gave way to afternoon, and in the afternoons he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) felt a little
better. And afternoon gave way to night. As some great twentieth-century thinker
had said, night must fall.
He (<font color='blue'><b>thinker</b></font>) found himself wishing that Wendy would ask him (<font color='blue'><b>thinker</b></font>) about the hedges, would ask
him (<font color='blue'><b>thinker</b></font>) what Danny meant, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said You know because you saw -- If she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) everything. Everything. The hedges, the woman in the room, even
about the fire hose that seemed to have switched positions. But where did
confession stop? Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'d thrown the magneto away, that they could
all be down in Sidewinder right now if he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hadn't done that?
What she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said was, <div class="bookquote">``Do you want tea?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. A cup of tea would be good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) went to the door and paused there, rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) forearms through her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
sweater. <div class="bookquote">``It's my fault as much as yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What were we doing while

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) went out to make tea, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) to keep watch over their son.

THE ELEVATOR
Jack awoke from a thin and uneasy sleep where huge and ill-defined shapes
chased him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) through endless snowfields to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) first thought was another
dream: darkness, and in it, a sudden mechanical jumble of noises -- clicks and
clanks, hummings, rattlings, snaps and whooshes.
Then Wendy sat up beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knew it was no dream.
<div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand, cold marble, gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wrist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) restrained an urge
to shake it off -- how in the hell was he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) supposed to know what it was? The
illuminated clock on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) nightstand said it was five minutes to twelve.
The humming sound again. Loud and steady, varying the slightest bit. Followed
by a clank as the humming ceased. A rattling bang. A thump. Then the humming
resumed.
It was the elevator.
Danny was sitting up. <div class="bookquote">``Daddy? Daddy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) voice was sleepy and scared.
<div class="bookquote">``Right here, doc,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said. <div class="bookquote">``Come on over and jump in. Your mom's awake,
too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>The bedclothes rustled as Danny got on the bed between them. ``It's the

<p/>elevator,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) whispered.
``That's right,'' Jack said. ``Just the elevator.''
``What do you mean, just?'' Wendy demanded. There was an ice-skim of hysteria on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) voice. ``It's the middle of the night. Who's running it?''
Hummmmmmm. Click/clank. Above them now. The rattle of the gate accordioning
back, the bump of the doors opening and closing. Then the hum of the motor and
the cables again.
Danny began to whimper.
Jack swung his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) feet out of bed and onto the floor. ``It's probably a short.
I'll check.''
``Don't you dare go out of this room!''
``Don't be stupid,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, pulling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) robe. ``It's my job.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was out of bed herself a moment later, pulling Danny with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
``We'll go, too.''
``Wendy -- ''
``What's wrong?'' Danny asked somberly. ``What's wrong, Daddy?''
Instead of answering he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) turned away, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face angry and set. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) belted his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
robe around him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) at the door, opened it, and stepped out into the dark hall.
Wendy hesitated for a moment, and it was actually Danny who began to move
first. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) caught up quickly, and they went out together.
Jack hadn't bothered with the lights. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fumbled for the switch that lit the
four spaced overheads in the hallway that led to the main corridor. Up ahead,
Jack was already turning the corner. This time Danny found the switchplate and
flicked all three switches up. The hallway leading down to the stairs and the
elevator shaft came alight.
Jack was standing at the elevator station, which was flanked by benches and
cigarette urns. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was standing motionless in front of the closed elevator door.
In his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) faded tartan bathrobe and brown leather slippers with the rundown heels,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hair all in sleep corkscrews and Alfalfa cowlicks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) looked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) like an
absurd twentieth-century Hamlet, an indecisive figure so mesmerized by onrushing
tragedy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was helpless to divert its course or alter it in any way.
-LRB-jesus stop thinking so crazy -- -RRB-
Danny's hand bad tightened painfully on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was looking up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
intently, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face strained and anxious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been catching the drift of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
thoughts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) realized. Just how much or how little of them he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was getting was
impossible to say, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) flushed, feeling much the same as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had caught
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) in a masturbatory act.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, and they went down the hall to Jack.
The hummings and clankings and thumpings were louder here, terrifying in a
disconnected, benumbed way. Jack was staring at the closed door with feverish
intensity. Through the diamond-shaped window in the center of the elevator door
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could make out the cables, thrumming slightly. The elevator
clanked to a stop below them, at lobby level. They heard the doors thump open.
And ...
-LRB-party-RRB-
Why had she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) thought party? The word had simply jumped into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head for no
reason at all. The silence in the Overlook was complete and intense except for
the weird noises coming up the elevator shaft.

<p/>-LRB-must have been quite a party-RRB-
-LRB-???WHAT PARTY???-RRB-
For just a moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mind had filled with an image so real that it seemed to
be a memory ... not just any memory but one of those you treasure, one of
those you keep for very special occasions and rarely mention aloud. Lights ...
hundreds, maybe thousands of them. Lights and colors, the pop of champagne
corks, a forty-piece orchestra playing Glenn Miller's <div class="bookquote">``In the Mood.''  (<font color='red'><b>Glenn Miller</b></font>)</div>But Glenn
Miller had gone down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) bomber before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was born, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) have a
memory of Glenn Miller?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) looked down at Danny and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head had cocked to one side, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was
hearing something she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) couldn't hear. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face was very pale.
Thump.
The door had slid shut down there. A humming whine as the elevator began to
rise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) saw the engine housing on top of the car first through the diamondshaped window, then the interior of the car, seen through the further diamond
shapes made by the brass gate. Warm yellow light from the car's overhead. It was
empty. The car was empty. It was empty but
-LRB-on the night of the party they must have crowded in by the dozens, crowded
the car way beyond its safety limit but of course it had been new then and all
of them wearing masks-RRB-
-LRB-????WHAT MASKS????-RRB-
The car stopped above them, on the third floor. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) looked at Danny. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face
was all eyes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth was pressed into a frightened, bloodless slit. Above
them, the brass gate rattled back. The elevator door thumped open, it thumped
open because it was time, the time had come, it was time to say
-LRB-Goodnight ... goodnight ... yes, it was lovely ... no, i really can't
stay for the unmasking ... early to bed, early to rise ... oh, was that
Sheila? ... the monk? ... isn't that witty, Sheila coming as a monk? ...
yes, goodnight ...good-RRB-
Thump.
Gears clashed. The motor engaged. The car began to whine back down.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``What is it? What's wrong with it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A short circuit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) said. His (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) face was like wood. <div class="bookquote">``I told you, it was a
short circuit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I keep hearing voices in my head!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``What is it? What's wrong? I
feel like I'm going crazy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What voices?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) with deadly blandness.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) turned to Danny. <div class="bookquote">``Did you -- ?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny nodded slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. And music. Like from a long time ago. In my head.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The elevator car stopped again. The hotel was silent, creaking, deserted.
Outside, the wind whined around the eaves in the darkness.
<div class="bookquote">``Maybe you are both crazy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said conversationally. <div class="bookquote">``I don't hear a
goddamned thing except that elevator having a case of the electrical hiccups. If
you two want to have duet hysterics, fine. But count me out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The elevator was coming down again.
Jack stepped to the right, where a glass-fronted box was mounted on the wall
at chest height. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) smashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) bare fist against it. Glass tinkled inward.
Blood dripped from two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knuckles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) reached in and took out a key with a

<p/>long, smooth barrel.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack, no. Don't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am going to do my job. Now leave me alone, Wendy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) tried to grab his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) backward. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) feet tangled in the hem
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) robe and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>) fell to the carpet with an ungainly thump. Danny cried out
shrilly and fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knees beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheila</b></font>). Jack turned back to the elevator and
thrust the key into the socket.
The elevator cables disappeared and the bottom of the car came into view in
the small window. A second later Jack turned the key hard. There was a grating,
screeching sound as the elevator car came to an instant standstill. For a moment
the declutched motor in the basement whined even louder, and then its circuit
breaker cut in and the Overlook went unearthly still. The night wind outside
seemed very loud by comparison. Jack looked stupidly at the gray metal elevator
door. There were three splotches of blood below the keyhole from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) lacerated
knuckles.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) turned back to Wendy and Danny for a moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was sitting up, and Danny
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) arm around her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). They were both staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) carefully, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was a
stranger they had never seen before, possibly a dangerous one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
mouth, not sure what was going to come out.
<div class="bookquote">``It... Wendy, it's my job.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said clearly: <div class="bookquote">``Fuck your job''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) turned back to the elevator, worked his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fingers into the crack that ran
down the right side of the door, and got it to open a little way. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was
able to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) whole weight on it and threw the door open.
The car had stopped halfway, its floor at Jack's chest level. Warm light still
spilled out of it, contrasting with the oily darkness of the shaft below.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) looked in for what seemed a long time.
<div class="bookquote">``It's empty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said then. <div class="bookquote">``A short circuit, like I said.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hooked his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
fingers into the slot behind the door and began to pull it closed ... then her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
hand was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shoulder, surprisingly strong, yanking him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) away.
<div class="bookquote">``Wendy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shouted. But she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had already caught the car's bottom edge and
pulled herself up enough so she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could look in. Then, with a convulsive heave of
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shoulder and belly muscles, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) tried to boost herself all the way up. For a
moment the issue was in doubt. Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) feet tottered over the blackness of the shaft
and one pink slipper fell from her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) foot and slipped out of sight.
<div class="bookquote">``Mommy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny screamed.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was up, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cheeks flushed, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) forehead as pale and shining as a
spirit lamp. <div class="bookquote">``What about this, Jack? Is this a short circuit?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) threw
something and suddenly the hall was full of drifting confetti, red and white and
blue and yellow. <div class="bookquote">``Is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>party</b></font>)</div>A green party streamer, faded to a pale pastel color
with age.
<div class="bookquote">``And this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) tossed it out and it came to rest on the blue-black jungle carpet, a black
silk cat's-eye mask, dusted with sequins at the temples.
<div class="bookquote">``Does that look like a short circuit to you, Jack?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) screamed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).
Jack stepped slowly away from it, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head mechanically back and
forth. The cat's-eye mask stared up blankly at the ceiling from the confettistrewn hallway carpet.

<p/><< 37 >>
THE BALLROOM
It was the first of December.
Danny was in the east-wing ballroom, standing on an over-stuffed, high-backed
wing chair, looking at the clock under glass. It stood in the center of the
ballroom's high, ornamental mantelpiece, flanked by two large ivory elephants.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) almost expected the elephants would begin to move and try to gore him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) with
their tusks as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stood there, but they were moveless. They were <div class="bookquote">``safe.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Since
the night of the elevator he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had come to divide all things at the Overlook into
two categories. The elevator, the basement, the playground, Room 217, and the
Presidential Suite -LRB-it was Suite, not Sweet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) had seen the correct spelling in
an account book Daddy had been reading at supper last night and had memorized it
carefully-RRB- -- those places were <div class="bookquote">``unsafe.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Their quarters, the lobby, and the porch
were <div class="bookquote">``safe.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Apparently the ballroom was, too.
-LRB-The elephants are, anyway.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) was not sure about other places and so avoided them on general principle.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) looked at the clock inside the glass dome. It was under glass because all
its wheels and cogs and springs were showing. A chrome or steel track ran around
the outside of these works, and directly below the clockface there was a small
axis bar with a pair of meshing cogs at either end. The hands of the clock stood
at quarter past XI, and although he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) didn't know Roman numerals he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) could guess by
the configuration of the hands at what time the clock had stopped. The clock
stood on a velvet base. In front of it, slightly distorted by the curve of the
dome, was a carefully carved silver key.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) supposed that the clock was one of the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) wasn't supposed to touch,
like the decorative fire-tools in their brass-bound cabinet by the lobby
fireplace or the tall china highboy at the back of the dining room.
A sense of injustice and a feeling of angry rebellion suddenly rose in him (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) and
-LRB-never mind what i'm not supposed to touch, just never mind. touched me,
hasn't it? played with me, hasn't it?-RRB-
It had. And it hadn't been particularly careful not to break him (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>), either.
Danny put his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands out, grasped the glass dome, and lifted it aside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) let
one finger play over the works for a moment, the pad of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) index finger denting
against the cogs, running smoothly over the wheels. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) picked up the silver key.
For an adult it would have been uncomfortably small, but it fitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) own
fingers perfectly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) placed it in the keyhole at the center of the clockface.
It went firmly home with a tiny click, more felt than heard. It wound to the
right, of course; clockwise.
Danny turned the key until it would turn no more and then removed it. The

<p/>clock began to tick. Cogs turned. A large balance wheel rocked back and forth in
semicircles. The hands were moving. If you kept your head perfectly motionless
and your eyes wide open, you could see the minute hand inching along toward its
meeting some forty-five minutes from now with the hour hand. At XII.
-LRB-And the Red Death held sway over all.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) frowned, and then shook the thought away. It was a thought with no meaning
or reference for him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) index finger out again and pushed the minute band up to the
hour, curious about what might happen. It obviously wasn't a cuckoo clock, but
that steel rail had to have some purpose.
There was a small, ratcheting series of clicks, and then the clock began to
tinkle Strauss's <div class="bookquote">``Blue Danube Waltz.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strauss</b></font>)</div>A punched roll of cloth no more than two
inches in width began to unwind. A small series of brass strikers rose and fell.
From behind the clockface two figures glided into view along the steel track,
ballet dancers, on the left a girl in a fluffy skirt and white stockings, on the
right a boy in a black leotard and ballet slippers. Their hands were held in
arches over their beads. They came together in the middle, in front of VI.
Danny espied tiny grooves in their sides, just below their armpits. The axis
bar slipped into these grooves and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) heard another small click. The cogs at
either end of the bar began to turn. <div class="bookquote">``The Blue Danube''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>tinkled. The dancers'
arms came down around each other. The boy flipped the girl up over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head and
then whirled over the bar. They were now lying prone, the boy's head buried
beneath the girl's short ballet skirt, the girl's face pressed against the
center of the boy's leotard. They writhed in a mechanical frenzy.
Danny's nose wrinkled. They were kissing peepees. That made him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) feel sick.
A moment later and things began to run backward. The boy whirled back over the
axis bar. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) flipped the girl into an upright position. They seemed to nod
knowingly at each other as their hands arched back over their heads. They
retreated the way they had come, disappearing just as <div class="bookquote">``The Blue Danube''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>finished. The clock began to strike a count of silver chimes.
-LRB-Midnight! Stroke of midnight!-RRB-
-LRB-Hooray for masks!-RRB-
Danny whirled on the chair, almost falling down. The ballroom was empty.
Beyond the double cathedral window he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could see fresh snow beginning to sift
down. The huge ballroom rug -LRB-rolled up for dancing, of course-RRB-, a rich tangle of
red and gold embroidery, lay undisturbed on the floor. Spaced around it were
small, intimate tables for two, the spidery chairs that went with each upended
with legs pointing at the ceiling.
The whole place was empty.
But it wasn't really empty. Because here in the Overlook things just went on
and on. Here in the Overlook all times were one. There was an endless night in
August of 1945, with laughter and drinks and a chosen shining few going up and
coming down in the elevator, drinking champagne and popping party favors in each
other's faces. It was a not-yet-light morning in June some twenty years later
and the organization hitters endlessly pumped shotgun shells into the torn and
bleeding bodies of three men who went through their agony endlessly. In a room
on the second floor a woman lolled in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tub and waited for visitors.
In the Overlook all things had a sort of life. It was as if the whole place

<p/>had been wound up with a silver key. The clock was running. The clock was
running.
He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was that key, Danny thought sadly. Tony had warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) had just let
things go on.
-LRB-I'm just five!-RRB-
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) cried to some half-felt presence in the room.
-LRB-Doesn't it make any deference that I'm just five?-RRB-
There was no answer.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) turned reluctantly back to the clock.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) had been putting it off, hoping that something would happen to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)
avoid trying to call Tony again, that a ranger would come, or a helicopter, or
the rescue team; they always came in time on his (<font color='blue'><b>ranger</b></font>) TV programs, the people were
saved. On TV the rangers and the SWAT squad and the paramedics were a friendly
white force counterbalancing the confused evil that he (<font color='blue'><b>ranger</b></font>) perceived in the world;
when people got in trouble they were helped out of it, they were fixed up. They
did not have to help themselves out of trouble.
-LRB-Please?-RRB-
There was no answer.
No answer, and if Tony came would it be the same nightmare? The booming, the
coarse and petulant voice, the blueblack rug like snakes? Redrum?
But what else?
-LRB-Please oh please-RRB-
No answer.
With a trembling sigh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) looked at the clockface. Cogs turned and meshed with
other cogs. The balance wheel rocked hypnotically back and forth. And if you
held your head perfectly still, you could see the minute hand creeping
inexorably down from XII to V. If you held your bead perfectly still you could
see that --
The clockface was gone. In its place was a round black hole. It led down into
forever. It began to swell. The clock was gone. The room behind it. Danny
tottered and then fell into the darkness that had been hiding behind the
clockface all along.
The small boy in the chair suddenly collapsed and lay in it at a crooked
unnatural angle, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head thrown back, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes staring sightlessly at the high
ballroom ceiling.
Down and down and down and down to --
-- the hallway, crouched in the hallway, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had made a wrong turn, trying
to get back to the stairs he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had made a wrong turn and now AND NOW --
-- he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was in the short dead-end corridor that led only to the
Presidential Suite and the booming sound was coming closer, the roque mallet
whistling savagely through the air, the head of it embedding itself into the
wall, cutting the silk paper, letting out small puffs of plaster dust.
-LRB-Goddammit, come out here! Take your-RRB-
But there was another figure in the hallway. Slouched nonchalantly against the
wall just behind him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Like a ghost.
No, not a ghost, but all dressed in white. Dressed in whites.
-LRB-I'll find you, you goddam little whoremastering RUNT!-RRB-
Danny cringed back from the sound. Coming up the main third-floor hall now.

<p/>Soon the owner of that voice would round the corner.
-LRB-Come here! Come here, you little shit!-RRB-
The figure dressed in white straightened up a little, removed a cigarette from
the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) mouth, and plucked a shred of tobacco from his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) full lower lip.
It was Hallorann, Danny saw. Dressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) cook's whites instead of the blue
suit he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been wearing on closing day.
<div class="bookquote">``If there is trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, <div class="bookquote">``you give a call. A big loud holler
like the one that knocked me back a few minutes ago. I might hear you even way
down in Florida. And if I do, I'll come on the run. I'll come on the run. I'll
come on the -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Come now, then! Come now, come NOW! Oh Dick I need you we all need-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">'' -- run. Sorry, but I got to run. Sorry, Danny ole kid ole doc, but I got to
run. It's sure been fun, you son of a gun, but I got to hurry, I got to run.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-No!-RRB-
But as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) watched, Dick Hallorann turned, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) cigarette back into the
corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) mouth, and stepped nonchalantly through the wall.
Leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) alone.
And that was when the shadow-figure turned the corner, huge in the hallway's
gloom, only the reflected red of its eyes clear.
-LRB-There you are! Now I've got you, you fuck! Now I'll teach you!-RRB-
It lurched toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) in a horrible, shambling run, the roque mallet swinging
up and up and up. Danny scrambled backward, screaming, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was
through the wall and falling, tumbling over and over, down the hole, down the
rabbit hole and into a land full of sick wonders.
Tony was far below him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>), also falling.
-LRB-I can't come anymore, Danny ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) won't let me near you ... none of them
will let me near you ... get Dick .. . get Dick ...-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``Tony!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Hallorann/DICK</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) screamed.
But Tony was gone and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) was in a dark room. But not entirely dark.
Muted light spilling from somewhere. It was Mommy and Daddy's bedroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) could
see Daddy's desk. But the room was a dreadful shambles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) had been in this room
before. Mommy's record player overturned on the floor. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) records scattered on
the rug. The mattress half off the bed. Pictures ripped from the walls. His (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) cot
lying on its side like a dead dog, the Violent Violet Volkswagen crushed to
purple shards of plastic.
The light was coming from the bathroom door, half-open. Just beyond it a hand
dangled limply, blood dripping from the tips of the fingers. And in the medicine
cabinet mirror, the word REDRUM flashing off and on.
Suddenly a huge clock in a glass bowl materialized in front of it. There were
no hands or numbers on the clockface, only a date written in red: DECEMBER 2.
And then, eyes widening in horror, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw the word REDRUM reflecting dimly from
the glass dome, now reflected twice. And he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw that it spelled MURDER.
Danny Torrance screamed in wretched terror. The date was gone from the
clockface. The clockface itself was gone, replaced by a circular black hole that
swelled and swelled like a dilating iris. It blotted out everything and he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) fell
forward, beginning to fall, falling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) was --
***

<p/>-- falling off the chair.
For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) lay on the ballroom floor, breathing bard.
REDRUM.
MURDER.
REDRUM.
MURDER.
-LRB-The Red Death held sway over all!-RRB-
-LRB-Unmask! Unmask!-RRB-
And behind each glittering lovely mask, the as-yet unseen face of the shape
that chased him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) down these dark hallways, its red eyes widening, blank and
homicidal.
Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) was afraid of what face might come to light when the time for unmasking
came around at last.
-LRB-DICK!-RRB-
he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) screamed with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) might. His (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) head seemed to shiver with the force of
it.
-LRB-!!! OH DICK OH PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE COME !!!-RRB-
Above him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) the clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had wound with the silver key continued to mark off the
seconds and minutes and hours.

FLORIDA

<p/>Mrs. Hallorann's third son, Dick, dressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) cook's whites, a Lucky Strike
parked in the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) mouth, backed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) reclaimed Cadillac limo out of its
space behind the One-A Wholesale Vegetable Mart and drove slowly around the
building. Masterton, part owner now but still walking with the patented shuffle
he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterton</b></font>) had adopted back before World War II, was pushing a bin of lettuces into the
high, dark building.
Hallorann pushed the button that lowered the passenger side window and
hollered: <div class="bookquote">``Those avocadoes is too damn high, you cheapskate!''
 (<font color='red'><b>passenger</b></font>)</div>Masterton looked back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterton</b></font>) shoulder, grinned widely enough to expose all
three gold teeth, and yelled back, <div class="bookquote">``And I know exactly where you can put em, my
good buddy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Masterton</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Remarks like that I keep track of, bro.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Masterton</b></font>)</div>Masterton gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Masterton</b></font>) the finger. Hallorann returned the compliment.
<div class="bookquote">``Get your cukes, did you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Masterton</b></font>)</div>Masterton asked.
<div class="bookquote">``I did.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You come back early tomorrow, I gonna give you some of the nicest new
potatoes you ever seen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I send the boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. <div class="bookquote">``You comin up tonight?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You supplyin the juice, bro?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's a big ten-four.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I be there. You keep that thing off the top end goin home, you hear me? Every
cop between here an St. Pete knows your name.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know all about it, huh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann asked, grinning.
<div class="bookquote">``I know more than you'll ever learn, my man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Listen to this sassy nigger. Would you listen?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go on, get outta here fore I start throwin these lettuces.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go on an throw em. I'll take anything for free.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Masterton</b></font>)</div>Masterton made as if to throw one. Hallorann ducked, rolled up the window, and
drove on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Masterton</b></font>) was feeling fine. For the last half hour or so he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterton</b></font>) had been smelling
oranges, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterton</b></font>) didn't find that queer. For the last half hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterton</b></font>) had been in a
fruit and vegetable market.
It was 4:30 p.m., EST, the first day of December, Old Man Winter settling his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>)
frostbitten rump firmly onto most of the country, but down here the men wore
open-throated shortsleeve shirts and the women were in light summer dresses and
shorts. On top of the First Bank of Florida building, a digital thermometer
bordered with huge grapefruits was flashing 79° over and over. Thank God for
Florida, Hallorann thought, mosquitoes and all.
In the back of the limo were two dozen avocados, a crate of cucumbers, ditto
oranges, ditto grapefruit. Three shopping sacks filled with Bermuda onions, the
sweetest vegetable a loving God ever created, some pretty good sweet peas, which
would be served with the entree and come back uneaten nine times out of ten, and
a single blue Hubbard squash that was strictly for personal consumption.
Hallorann stopped in the turn lane at the Vermont Street light, and when the
green arrow showed he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) pulled out onto state highway 219, pushing up to forty and
holding it there until the town began to trickle away into an exurban sprawl of
gas stations, Burger Kings, and McDonalds. It was a small order today, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) could

<p/>have sent Baedecker after it, but Baedecker had been chafing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) chance to
buy the meat, and besides, Hallorann never missed a chance to bang it back and
forth with Frank Masterton if he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) could help it. Masterton might show up tonight
to watch some TV and drink Hallorann's Bushmill's, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterton</b></font>) might not. Either way
was all right. But seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Masterton</b></font>) mattered. Every time it mattered now, because they
weren't young anymore. In the last few days it seemed he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterton</b></font>) was thinking of that
very fact a great deal. Not so young anymore, when you got up near sixty years
old -LRB-or tell the truth and save a lie -- past it-RRB- you had to start thinking about
stepping out. You could go anytime. And that had been on his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterton</b></font>) mind this week, not
in a heavy way but as a fact. Dying was a part of living. You had to keep tuning
in to that if you expected to be a whole person. And if the fact of your own
death was hard to understand, at least it wasn't impossible to accept.
Why this should have been on his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterton</b></font>) mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterton</b></font>) could not have said, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Masterton</b></font>) other
reason for getting this small order himself was so he (<font color='blue'><b>Masterton</b></font>) could step upstairs to the
small office over Frank's Bar and Grill. There was a lawyer up there now -LRB-the
dentist who had been there last year had apparently gone broke-RRB-, a young black
fellow named McIver. Hallorann had stepped in and told this McIver that he (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>)
wanted to make a will, and could McIver help him (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) out? Well, McIver asked, how
soon do you want the document? Yesterday, said Hallorann, and threw his (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) head
back and laughed. Have you got anything complicated in mind? was McIver's next
question. Hallorann did not. He (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) Cadillac, his (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) bank account -- some nine
thousand dollars -- a piddling checking account, and a closet of clothes. He (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>)
wanted it all to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) sister. And if your sister predeceases you? McIver
asked. Never mind, Hallorann said. If that happens, I'll make a new will. The
document had been completed and signed in less than three hours -- fast work for a
shyster -- and now resided in Hallorann's breast pocket, folded into a stiff blue
envelope with the word WILL on the outside in Old English letters.
He (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) could not have said why he (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) had chosen this warm sunny day when he (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) felt so
well to do something he (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) had been putting off for years, but the impulse had come
on him (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) hadn't said no. He (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) was used to following his (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) hunches.
He (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) was pretty well out of town now. He (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) cranked the limo up to an illegal sixty
and let it ride there in the left-hand lane, sucking up most of the Petersburgbound traffic. He (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) knew from experience that the limo would still ride as solid
as iron at ninety, and even at a hundred and twenty it didn't seem to lighten up
much. But his (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) screamin days were long gone. The thought of putting the limo up
to a hundred and twenty on a straight stretch only scared him (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>McIver</b></font>) was getting
old.
-LRB-Jesus, those oranges smell strong. Wonder if they gone over?-RRB-
Bugs splattered against the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) dialed the radio to a Miami soul
station and got the soft, wailing voice of Al Green.
<div class="bookquote">``What a beautiful time we had together,
Now it's getting late and we must leave each other...''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) unrolled the window, pitched his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) cigarette butt out, then rolled it further
down to clear out the smell of the oranges. He (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) tapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) fingers against the
wheel and hummed along under his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) breath. Hooked over the rearview mirror, his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>)
St. Christopher's medal swung gently back and forth.

<p/>And suddenly the smell of oranges intensified and he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) knew it was coming,
something was coming at him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) own eyes in the rearview, widening,
surprised. And then it came all at once, came in a huge blast that drove out
everything else: the music, the road ahead, his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) own absent awareness of himself
as a unique human creature. It was as if someone had put a psychic gun to his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>)
head and shot him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) with a .45 caliber scream.
-LRB-!!! OH DICK OH PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE COME!!!-RRB-
The limo had just drawn even with a Pinto station wagon driven by a man in
workman's clothes. The workman saw the limo drifting into his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) lane and laid on
the born. When the Cadillac continued to drift he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) snapped a look at the driver
and saw a big black man bolt upright behind the wheel, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes looking vaguely
upward. Later the workman told his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) wife that he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) knew it was just one of those
niggery hairdos they were all wearing these days, but at the time it had looked
just as if every hair on that coon's head was standing on end. He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) thought the
black man was having a heart attack.
The workman braked hard, dropping back into a luckily empty space behind him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>).
The rear end of the Cadillac pulled ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>), still cutting in, and the
workman stared with bemused horror as the long, rocket-shaped rear taillights
cut into his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) lane no more than a quarter of an inch in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) bumper.
The workman cut to the left, still laying on his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) horn, and roared around the
drunkenly weaving limousine. He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) invited the driver of the limo to perform an
illegal sex act on himself. To engage in oral congress with various rodents and
birds. He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) articulated his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) own proposal that all persons of Negro blood return to
their native continent. He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) sincere belief in the position the
limo-driver's soul would occupy in the afterlife. He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) finished by saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)
believed be had met the limo-driver's mother in a New Orleans house of
prostitution.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) was ahead and out of danger and suddenly aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) had wet his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)
pants.
In Hallorann's mind the thought kept repeating
-LRB-COME DICK PLEASE COME DICK PLEASE-RRB-
but it began to fade off the way a radio station will as you approach the
limits of its broadcasting area. He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) became fuzzily aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) car was
tooling along the soft shoulder at better than fifty miles an hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) guided it
back onto the road, feeling the rear end fishtail for a moment before regaining
the composition surface.
There was an A&W Rootbeer stand just ahead. Hallorann signaled and turned in,
his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) heart thudding painfully in his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) chest, his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) face a sickly gray color. He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)
pulled into a parking slot, took his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) handkerchief out of his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) pocket, and mopped
his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) forehead with it.
-LRB-Lord God!-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``May I help you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The voice startled him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) again, even though it wasn't the voice of God but that
of a cute little carhop, standing by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) open window with an order pad.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, baby, a rootbeer float. Two scoops of vanilla, okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) walked away, hips rolling nicely beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) red nylon
uniform.
Hallorann leaned back against the leather seat and closed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes. There was

<p/>nothing left to pick up. The last of it had faded out between pulling in here
and giving the waitress his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) order. All that was left was a sick, thudding
headache, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) brain had been twisted and wrung out and hung up to dry.
Like the headache he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'d gotten from letting that boy Danny shine at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) up there
at Ullman's Folly.
But this had been much louder. Then the boy had only been playing a game with
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). This had been pure panic, each word screamed aloud in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bead.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arms. Hot sunshine lay on them but they had still goosebumped. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had told the boy to call him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) needed help, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) remembered that.
And now the boy was calling.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) suddenly wondered how he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could have left that boy up there at all, shining
the way he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did. There was bound to be trouble, maybe bad trouble.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) suddenly keyed the limo, put it in reverse, and pulled back onto the
highway, peeling rubber. The waitress with the rolling hips stood in the A&W
stand's archway, a tray with a rootbeer float on it in her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) hands.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it with you, a fire?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) shouted, but Hallorann was gone.
***
The manager was a man named Queems, and when Hallorann came in Queems was
conversing with his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) bookie. He (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) wanted the four-horse at Rockaway. No, no parlay,
no quinella, no exacta, no goddam futura. Just the little old four, six hundred
dollars on the nose. And the Jets on Sunday. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) mean, the Jets were
playing the Bills? Didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) know who the Jets were playing? Five hundred,
seven-point spread. When Queems hung up, looking put-out, Hallorann understood
how a man could make fifty grand a year running this little spa and still wear
suits with shiny seats. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regarded Hallorann with an eye that was still
bloodshot from too many glances into last night's bourbon bottle.
<div class="bookquote">``Problems, Dick?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, Mr. Queems, I guess so. I need three days off.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kents</b></font>)</div>There was a package of Kents in the breast pocket of Queems's sheer yellow
shirt. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached one out of the pocket without removing the pack, tweezing it
out, and bit down morosely on the patented Micronite filter. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lit it with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
desktop Cricket.
<div class="bookquote">``So do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But what's on your mind?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I need three days,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hallorann repeated. <div class="bookquote">``It's my boy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Queems/Mr. Queems</b></font>)</div>Queems's eyes dropped to Hallorann's left hand, which was ringless.
<div class="bookquote">``I been divorced since 1964,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said patiently.
<div class="bookquote">``Dick, you know what the weekend situation is. We're full. To the gunnels.
Even the cheap seats. We're even filled up in the Florida Room on Sunday night.
So take my watch, my wallet, my pension fund. Hell, you can even take my wife if
you can stand the sharp edges. But please don't ask me for time off. What is he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>),
sick?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, still trying to visualize himself twisting a cheap
cloth hat and rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) eyeballs. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) shot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shot!''  (<font color='red'><b>Queems/Mr. Queems</b></font>)</div>Queems said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) Kent down in an ashtray which bore the emblem
of Ole Miss, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) was a business admin graduate.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said somberly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hunting accident?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) voice drop to a lower, huskier note.
<div class="bookquote">``Jana, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jana</b></font>)'s been livin with this truck driver. A white man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shot my boy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s in a hospital in Denver, Colorado. Critical condition.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How in hell did you find out? I thought you were buying vegetables.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, I was.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) had stopped at the Western Union office just before
coming here to reserve an Avis car at Stapleton Airport. Before leaving he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) had
swiped a Western Union flimsy. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) took the folded and crumpled blank form
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) pocket and flashed it before Queems's bloodshot eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) put it back in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) pocket and, allowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) voice to drop another notch, said: <div class="bookquote">``Jana sent it.
It was waitin in my letterbox when I got back just now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jesus. Jesus Christ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Queems/Mr. Queems</b></font>)</div>Queems said. There was a peculiar tight expression of
concern on his (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) face, one Hallorann was familiar with. It was as close to an
expression of sympathy as a white man who thought of himself as <div class="bookquote">``good with the
coloreds''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>could get when the object was a black man or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mythical black son.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, okay, you get going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Queems/Mr. Queems</b></font>)</div>Queems said. <div class="bookquote">``Baedecker can take over for three
days, I guess. The potboy can help out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann nodded, letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) face get longer still, but the thought of the
potboy helping out Baedecker made him (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) grin inside. Even on a good day Hallorann
doubted if the potboy could hit the urinal on the first squirt.
<div class="bookquote">``I want to rebate back this week's pay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. <div class="bookquote">``The whole thing. I
know what a bind this puttin you in, Mr. Queems, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Queems's expression got tighter still it looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) might have a fishbone
caught in his (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) throat. <div class="bookquote">``We can talk about that later. You go on and pack. I'll
talk to Baedecker. Want me to make you a plane reservation?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, I'll do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Queems stood up, leaned sincerely forward, and inhaled a raft of
ascending smoke from his (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) Kent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) coughed heartily, his (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) thin white face turning
red. Hallorann struggled hard to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) somber expression. <div class="bookquote">``I hope everything
turns out, Dick. Call when you get word.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll do that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They shook hands over the desk.
Hallorann made himself get down to the ground floor and across to the hired
help's compound before bursting into rich, bead-shaking laughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) was still
grinning and mopping his (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) streaming eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) handkerchief when the smell of
oranges came, thick and gagging, and the bolt followed it, striking him (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) in the
head, sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) back against the pink stucco wall in a drunken stagger.
-LRB-!!! PLEASE COME DICK PLEASE COME COME
QUICK !!!-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) recovered a little at a time and at last felt capable of climbing the
outside stairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) apartment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) kept the latchkey under the rush-plaited
doormat, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) reached down to get it, something fell out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) inner
pocket and fell to the second-floor decking with a flat thump. His (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) mind was
still so much on the voice that had shivered through his (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) head that for a moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) could only look at the blue envelope blankly, not knowing what it was.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) turned it over and the word WILL stared up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Queems</b></font>) in the black spidery

<p/>letters.
-LRB-Oh my God is it like that?-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) didn't know. But it could be. All week long the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own ending
had been on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mind like a ... well, like a
-LRB-Go on, say it-RRB-
like a premonition,.
Death? For a moment his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) whole life seemed to flash before him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), not in a
historical sense, no topography of the ups and downs that Mrs. Hallorann's third
son, Dick, had lived through, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) life as it was now. Martin Luther King had
told them not long before the bullet took him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) down to his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) martyr's grave that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
had been to the mountain. Dick could not claim that. No mountain, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had
reached a sunny plateau after years of struggle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had good friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had all
the references he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) would ever need to get a job anywhere. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) wanted fuck,
why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) could find a friendly one with no questions asked and no big shitty
struggle about what it all meant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had come to terms with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) blackness -- happy
terms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was up past sixty and thank God, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was cruising.
Was he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) going to chance the end of that -- the end of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) -- for three white people
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) didn't even know?
But that was a lie, wasn't it?
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew the boy. They had shared each other the way good friends can't even
after forty years of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew the boy and the boy knew him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), because they each
had a kind of searchlight in their heads, something they hadn't asked for,
something that had just been given.
-LRB-Naw, you got a flashlight, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the one with the searchlight.-RRB-
And sometimes that light, that shine, seemed like a pretty nice thing. You
could pick the horses, or like the boy had said, you could tell your daddy where
his (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) trunk was when it turned up missing. But that was only dressing, the sauce
on the salad, and down below there was as much bitter vetch in that salad as
there was cool cucumber. You could taste pain and death and tears. And now the
boy was stuck in that place, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would go. For the boy. Because, speaking to
the boy, they had only been different colors when they used their mouths. So he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
would go. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would do what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could, because if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't, the boy was going to
die right inside his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head.
But because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was human he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could not help a bitter wish that the cup had
never been passed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) way.
***
-LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had started to get out and come after him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been dumping a change of clothes into an overnight bag when the thought
came to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), freezing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with the power of the memory as it always did when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
thought of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tried to think of it as seldom as possible.
The maid, Delores Vickery her (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) name was, had been hysterical. Had said some
things to the other chambermaids, and worse still, to some of the guests. When
the word got back to Ullman, as the silly quiff should have known it would do,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had fired her (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) out of hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) had come to Hallorann in tears, not about
being fired, but about the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) had seen in that second-floor room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) had
gone into 217 to change the towels, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) said, and there had been that Mrs.

<p/>Massey, lying dead in the tub. That, of course, was impossible. Mrs. Massey had
been discreetly taken away the day before and was even then winging her (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) way back
to New York -- in the shipping hold instead of the first class she (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>)'d been
accustomed to.
Hallorann hadn't liked Delores much, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vickery</b></font>) had gone up to look that evening.
The maid was an olive-complected girl of twenty-three who waited tables near the
end of the season when things slowed down. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had a small shining, Hallorann
judged, really not more than a twinkle; a mousy-looking man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) escort,
wearing a faded cloth coat, would come in for dinner and Delores would trade one
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delores</b></font>) tables for theirs. The mousy little man would leave a picture of
Alexander Hamilton under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plate, bad enough for the girl who had made the
trade, but worse, Delores would crow over it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delores</b></font>) was lazy, a goof-off in an
operation run by a man who allowed no goof-offs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delores</b></font>) would sit in a linen
closet, reading a confession magazine and smoking, but whenever Ullman went on
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) unscheduled prowls -LRB-and woe to the girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) caught resting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feet-RRB-
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) working industriously, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) magazine hidden under the sheets on a
high shelf, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ashtray tucked safely into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) uniform pocket. Yeah, Hallorann
thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>)'d been a goof-off and a sloven and the other girls had resented
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>), but Delores had had that little twinkle. It had always greased the skids
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delores</b></font>). But what she (<font color='blue'><b>Delores</b></font>) had seen in 217 had scared her (<font color='blue'><b>Delores</b></font>) badly enough so she (<font color='blue'><b>Delores</b></font>) was
more than glad to pick up the walking papers Ullman had issued her (<font color='blue'><b>Delores</b></font>) and go.
Why had she (<font color='blue'><b>Delores</b></font>) come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)? A shine knows a shine, Hallorann thought, grinning at
the pun.
So he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had gone up that night and had let himself into the room, which was to
be reoccupied the next day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had used the office passkey to get in, and if
Ullman had caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) with that key, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) would have joined Delores Vickery on the
unemployment line.
The shower curtain around the tub had been drawn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had pushed it back, but
even before he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) did he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)'d had a premonition of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) was going to see. Mrs.
Massey, swollen and purple, lay soggily in the tub, which was half-full of
water. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had stood looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>), a pulse beating thickly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) throat.
There had been other things at the Overlook: a bad dream that recurred at
irregular intervals -- some sort of costume party and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) was catering it in the
Overlook's ballroom and at the shout to unmask, everybody exposed faces that
were those of rotting insects -- and there had been the hedge animals. Twice,
maybe three times, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had -LRB-or thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had-RRB- seen them move, ever so slightly.
That dog would seem to change from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) sitting-up posture to a slightly crouched
one, and the lions seemed to move forward, as if menacing the little tykes on
the playground. Last year in May Ullman had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) up to the attic to look for
the ornate set of firetools that now stood beside the lobby fireplace. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>)
had been up there the three lightbulbs strung overhead had gone out and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had
lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) way back to the trapdoor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had stumbled around for an unknown length
of time, closer and closer to panic, barking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) shins on boxes and bumping into
things, with a stronger and stronger feeling that something was stalking him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) in
the dark. Some great and frightening creature that had just oozed out of the
woodwork when the lights went out. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had literally stumbled over the
trapdoor's ringbolt he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had hurried down as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) could, leaving the trap
open, sooty and disheveled, with a feeling of disaster barely averted. Later

<p/>Ullman had come down to the kitchen personally, to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had left the
attic trapdoor open and the lights burning up there. Did Hallorann think the
guests wanted to go up there and play treasure hunt? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) think electricity
was free?
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) suspected -- no, was nearly positive -- that several of the guests had seen
or heard things, too. In the three years he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) had been there, the Presidential
Suite had been booked nineteen times. Six of the guests who had put up there had
left the hotel early, some of them looking markedly ill. Other guests had left
other rooms with the same abruptness. One night in August of 1974, near dusk, a
man who had won the Bronze and Silver Stars in Korea -LRB-that man now sat on the
boards of three major corporations and was said to have personally pink-slipped
a famous TV news anchorman-RRB- unaccountably went into a fit of screaming hysterics
on the putting green. And there had been dozens of children during Hallorann's
association with the Overlook who simply refused to go into the playground. One
child had had a convulsion while playing in the concrete rings, but Hallorann
didn't know if that could be attributed to the Overlook's deadly siren song or
not -- word had gone around among the help that the child, the only daughter of a
handsome movie actor, was a medically controlled epileptic who had simply
forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) medicine that day.
And so, staring down at the corpse of Mrs. Massey, he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) had been frightened but
not completely terrified. It was not completely unexpected. Terror came when she (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>)
opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) eyes to disclose blank silver pupils and began to grin at him (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>). Horror
came when
-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Massey</b></font>) had started to get out and come after him (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>).-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) had fled, heart racing, and had not felt safe even with the door shut and
locked behind him (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>). In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) admitted to himself now as he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) zipped the
fiightbag shut, he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) had never felt safe anywhere in the Overlook again.
And now the boy -- calling, screaming for help.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) watch. It was 5:30 P.m.. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went to the apartment's door,
remembered it would be heavy winter now in Colorado, especially up in the
mountains, and went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) closet. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) long, sheepskin-lined
overcoat out of its polyurethane dry-cleaning bag and put it over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm. It
was the only winter garment he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) owned. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turned off all the lights and looked
around. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forgotten anything? Yes. One thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took the will out of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
breast pocket and slipped it into the margin of the dressing table mirror. With
luck he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would be back to get it.
Sure, with luck.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left the apartment, locked the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), put the key under the rush
mat, and ran down the outside steps to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) converted Cadillac.
***
Halfway to Miami International, comfortably away from the switchboard where
Queems or Queems's toadies were known to listen in, Hallorann stopped at a
shopping center Laundromat and called United Air Lines. Flights to Denver?
There was one due out at 6:36 p.m. Could the gentleman make that?
Hallorann looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) watch, which showed 6:02, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could. What
about vacancies on the flight?

<p/>Just let me check.
A clunking sound in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ear followed by saccharine Montavani, which was
supposed to make being on hold more pleasant. It didn't. Hallorann danced from
one foot to the other, alternating glances between his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) watch and a young girl
with a sleeping baby, in a hammock on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) back unloading a coin-op Maytag. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>)
was afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) was going to get home later than she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) planned and the roast would
burn and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) husband -- Mark? Mike? Matt? -- would be mad.
A minute passed. Two. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) had just about made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) mind to drive ahead and
take his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) chances when the cannedsounding voice of the flight reservations clerk
came back on. There was an empty seat, a cancellation. It was in first class.
Did that make any difference?
No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) wanted it.
Would that be cash or credit card?
Cash, baby, cash. I've got to fly.
And the name was -- ?
Hallorann, two l's, two n's. Catch you later.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) hung up and hurried toward the door. The girl's simple thought, worry for
the roast, broadcast at him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) over and over until be thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) would go mad.
Sometimes it was like that, for no reason at all you would catch a thought,
completely isolated, completely pure and clear ... and usually completely
useless.
***
He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) almost made it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) had the limo cranked up to eighty and the airport was actually in sight
when one of Florida's Finest pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) over.
Hallorann unrolled the electric window and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) mouth at the cop, who
was flipping up pages in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) citation book.
<div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cop</b></font>)</div>the cop said comfortingly. <div class="bookquote">``It's a funeral in Cleveland. Your

 (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>Hallorann looked into the cop's calm blue eyes, debated telling his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) my-son-isin-critical-condition story anyway, and decided that would make things worse.
This Smokey was no Queems. He (<font color='blue'><b>Smokey</b></font>) dug out his (<font color='blue'><b>Smokey</b></font>) wallet.
<div class="bookquote">``Wonderful,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cop</b></font>)</div>the cop said. <div class="bookquote">``Would you take them out for me, please? I just
have to see how it's all going to come out in the end.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Silently, Hallorann took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Smokey</b></font>) driver's license and his (<font color='blue'><b>Smokey</b></font>) Florida registration

<div class="bookquote">``That's very good. That's so good you win a present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann asked hopefully.

 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann closed his (<font color='blue'><b>cop</b></font>) eyes.
***
He (<font color='blue'><b>cop</b></font>) got to the United desk at 6:49, hoping against hope that the flight had
been delayed. He (<font color='blue'><b>cop</b></font>) didn't even have to ask. The departure monitor over the
incoming passengers desk told the story. Flight 901 for Denver, due out at 6:36
EST, had left at 6:40. Nine minutes before.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh shit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Hallorann/DICK</b></font>)</div>Dick Hallorann said.
And suddenly the smell of oranges, heavy and cloying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) had just time to
reach the men's room before it came, deafening, terrified:
-LRB-!!! COME PLEASE COME DICK PLEASE PLEASE
COME !!!-RRB-

<p/><< 39 >>
ON THE STAIRS
One of the things they had sold to swell their liquid assets a little before
moving from Vermont to Colorado was Jack's collection of two hundred old rock
'n' roll and r & b albums; they had gone at the yard sale for a dollar apiece.
One of these albums, Danny's personal favorite, had been an Eddie Cochran
double-record set with four pages of bound-in liner notes by Lenny Kaye. Wendy
had often been struck by Danny's fascination for this one particular album by a
manboy who had lived fast and died young ... had died, in fact, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
herself had only been ten years old.
Now, at quarter past seven -LRB-mountain time-RRB-, as Dick Hallorann was telling
Queems about his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) ex-wife's white boyfriend, she (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) came upon Danny sitting halfway
up the stairs between the lobby and the first floor, tossing a red rubber ball
from hand to band and singing one of the songs from that album. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) voice was
low and tuneless.
<div class="bookquote">``So I climb one-two flight three flight four,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny sang, <div class="bookquote">``five flight six
flight seven flight more ... when I get to the top, I'm too tired to rock ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) came around him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), sat down on one of the stair risers, and saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
lower lip had swelled to twice its size and that there was dried blood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
chin. Her (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) heart took a frightened leap in her (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) chest, but she (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) managed to speak
neutrally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What happened, doc?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) asked, although she (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) knew. Jack had hit
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). Well, of course. That came next, didn't it? The wheels of progress; sooner
or later they took you back to where you started from.
<div class="bookquote">``I called Tony,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. <div class="bookquote">``In the ballroom. I guess I fell off the chair.
It doesn't hurt anymore. Just feels ... like my lip's too big.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that what really happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) asked, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), troubled.
<div class="bookquote">``Daddy didn't do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Not today.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), feeling eerie. The ball traveled from one band to the other.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had read her (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) mind. Her (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) son had read her (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) mind.
<div class="bookquote">``What ... what did Tony tell you, Danny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) face was calm, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) voice chillingly indifferent.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny -- ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) shoulder, harder than she (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) had intended. But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
didn't wince, or even try to shake her (<font color='blue'><b>ex-wife</b></font>) off.
-LRB-Oh we are wrecking this boy. It's not just Jack, it's me too, and maybe it's
not even just us, Jack's father, my mother, are they here too? Sure, why not?

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about tomorrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>***
The kitchen was cold and deserted under the overhead fluorescent bars. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
went to the rack where the carving knives hung from their magnetized strips. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
took the longest and sharpest, wrapped it in a dish towel, and left the kitchen,
turning off the lights as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went.
***
Danny sat on the stairs, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes following the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) red rubber ball
from hand to hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sang: ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) lives on the twentieth floor uptown, the
elevator is broken down. So I walk one-two flight three flight four. . :'
-LRB- -- Lou, Lou, skip to m' Lou -- -RRB-
His (<font color='blue'><b>Lou</b></font>) singing broke off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lou</b></font>) listened.
-LRB- -- Skip to m' Lou my darlin' -- -RRB-
The voice was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lou</b></font>) head, so much a part of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lou</b></font>), so frighteningly close that
it might have been a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lou</b></font>) own thoughts. It was soft and infinitely sly.
Mocking him (<font color='blue'><b>Lou</b></font>). Seeming to say:
-LRB-Oh yes, you'll like it here. Try it, you'll like it. Try it, you'll liiiiike
it -- -RRB-
Now his (<font color='blue'><b>Lou</b></font>) ears were open and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lou</b></font>) could hear them again, the gathering, ghosts or
spirits or maybe the hotel itself, a dreadful funhouse where all the sideshows
ended in death, where all the specially painted boogies were really alive, where
hedges walked, where a small silver key could start the obscenity. Soft and
sighing, rustling like the endless winter wind that played under the eaves at
night, the deadly lulling wind the summer tourists never heard. It was like the
somnolent hum of summer wasps in a ground nest, sleepy, deadly, beginning to
wake up. They were ten thousand feet high.
-LRB-Why is a raven like a writing desk? The higher the fewer, of course! Have
another cup of tea!-RRB-
It was a living sound, but not voices, not breath. A man of a philosophical
bent might have called it the sound of souls. Dick Hallorann's Nana, who had
grown up on southern roads in the years before the turn of the century, would
have called it ha'ants. A psychic investigator might have had a long name for
it -- psychic echo, psychokinesis, a telesmic sport. But to Danny it was only the
sound of the hotel, the old monster, creaking steadily and ever more closely
around them: halls that now stretched back through time as well as distance,
hungry shadows, unquiet guests who did not rest easy.
In the darkened ballroom the clock under glass struck seven-thirty with a
single musical note.
A hoarse voice, made brutal with drink, shouted: <div class="bookquote">``Unmask and let's fuck!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Wendy, halfway across the lobby, jerked to a standstill.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked at Danny on the stairs, still tossing the ball from hand to hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you hear something?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny only looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and continued to toss the ball from hand to hand.
There would be little sleep for them that night, although they slept together
behind a locked door.
And in the dark, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes open, Danny thought:
-LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wants to be one of them and live forever. That's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wants.-RRB-
Wendy thought:
-LRB-If I have to, I'll take him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) further up. If we're going to die I'd rather do
it in the mountains.-RRB-
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had left the butcher knife, still wrapped in the towel, under the bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand close to it. They dozed off and on. The hotel creaked around them.
Outside snow had begun to spit down from the sky like lead.

<p/><< 40 >>
IN THE BASEMENT
-LRB-!!! The boiler the goddam boiler !!!-RRB-
The thought came into Jack Torrance's mind full-blown, edged in bright,
warning red. On its heels, the voice of Watson:
-LRB-If you forget it'll just creep an creep and like as not you an your fambly
wilt end up on the fuckin moon ... she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)'s rated for two-fifty but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)'d blow
long before that now ... I'd be scared to come down and stand next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) at a
hundred and eighty.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>)'d been down here all night, poring over the boxes of old records, possessed
by a frantic feeling that time was getting short and he (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) would have to hurry.
Still the vital clues, the connections that would make everything clear, eluded
him (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) fingers were yellow and grimy with crumbling old paper. And he (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>)'d become
so absorbed he (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) hadn't checked the boiler once. He (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>)'d dumped it the previous
evening around six o'clock, when he (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) first came down. It was now...
He (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) watch and jumped up, kicking over e stack of old invoices.
Christ, it was quarter of five in the morning.
Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>), the furnace kicked on. The boiler was making a groaning, whistling
sound.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) ran to it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) face, which had become thinner in the last month or so, was
now heavily shadowed with beardstubble and he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had a hollow concentration-camp
look.
The boiler pressure gauge stood at two hundred and ten pounds per square inch.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) could almost see the sides of the old patched and welded boiler
heaving out with the lethal strain.
-LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) creeps ... I'd be scared to come down and stand next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) at a

<p/>hundred and eighty ...-RRB-
Suddenly a cold and tempting inner voice spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>).
-LRB-Let it go. Go get Wendy and Danny and get the fuck out of here. Let it blow
sky-high.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could visualize the explosion. A double thunderclap that would first rip
the heart from this place, then the soul. The boiler would go with an orangeviolet flash that would rain hot and burning shrapnel all over the cellar. In
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could see the redhot trinkets of metal careening from floor to walls
to ceiling like strange billiard balls, whistling jagged death through the air.
Some of them, surely, would whizz right through that stone arch, light on the
old papers on the other side, and they would burn merry hell. Destroy the
secrets, burn the clues, it's a mystery no living hand will ever solve. Then the
gas explosion, a great rumbling crackle of flame, a giant pilot light that would
turn the whole center of the hotel into a broiler. Stairs and hallways and
ceilings and rooms aflame like the castle in the last reel of a Frankenstein
movie. The flame spreading into the wings, hurrying up the black-and-blue-twined
carpets like eager guests. The silk wallpaper charring and curling. There were
no sprinklers, only those outmoded hoses and no one to use them. And there
wasn't a fire engine in the world that could get here before late March. Burn,
baby, burn. In twelve hours there would be nothing left but the bare bones.
The needle on the gauge had moved up to two-twelve. The boiler was creaking
and groaning like an old woman trying to get out of bed. Hissing jets of steam
had begun to play around the edges of old patches; beads of solder had begun to
sizzle.
He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) didn't see, he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) didn't hear. Frozen with his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand on the valve that would
dump off the pressure and damp the fire, Jack's eyes glittered from their
sockets like sapphires.
-LRB-It's my last chance.-RRB-
The only thing not cashed in now was the life-insurance policy he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had taken
out jointly with Wendy in the summer between his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) first and second years at
Stovington. Forty-thousand-dollar death benefit, double indemnity if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
died in a train crash, a plane crash, or a fire. Seven-come-eleven, die the
secret death and win a hundred dollars.
-LRB-A fire ... eighty thousand dollars.-RRB-
They would have time to get out. Even if they were sleeping, they would have
time to get out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) believed that. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) didn't think the hedges or anything
else would try to hold them back if the Overlook was going up in flames.
-LRB-Flames.-RRB-
The needle inside the greasy, almost opaque dial had danced up to two hundred
and fifteen pounds per square inch.
Another memory occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), a childhood memory. There had been a wasps'
nest in the lower branches of their apple tree behind the house. One of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
older brothers -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) couldn't remember which one now -- had been stung while
swinging in the old tire Daddy had hung from one of the tree's lower branches.
It had been late summer, when wasps tend to be at their ugliest.
Their father, just home from work, dressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) whites, the smell of beer
hanging around his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face in a fine mist, had gathered all three boys, Brett,
Mike, and little Jacky, and told them he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) was going to get rid of the wasps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now watch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) had said, smiling and staggering a little -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) hadn't been
using the cane then, the collision with the milk truck was years in the future-RRB-.
<div class="bookquote">``Maybe you'll learn something. My father showed me this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) had raked a big pile of rain-dampened leaves under the branch where the
wasps' nest rested, a deadlier fruit than the shrunken but tasty apples their
tree usually produced in late September, which was then still half a month away.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) lit the leaves. The day was clear and windless. The leaves smoldered but
didn't really burn, and they made a smell -- a fragrance that had echoed back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>)
each fall when men in Saturday pants and light Windbreakers raked leaves
together and burned them. A sweet smell with a bitter undertone, rich and
evocative. The smoldering leaves produced great rafts of smoke that drifted up
to obscure the nest.
Their father had let the leaves smolder all that afternoon, drinking beer on
the porch and dropping the empty Black Label cans into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife's plastic
floorbucket while his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) two older sons flanked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and little Jacky sat on the
steps at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feet, playing with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) Bolo Bouncer and singing monotonously over
and over: <div class="bookquote">``Your cheating heart ... will make you weep ... your cheating
heart ... is gonna tell on you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bolo Bouncer singing</b></font>)</div>At quarter of six, just before supper, Daddy had gone out to the apple tree
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) sons grouped carefully behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>). In one hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) had a garden hoe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>)
knocked the leaves apart, leaving little clots spread around to smolder and die.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) reached the hoe handle up, weaving and blinking, and after two or three
tries he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) knocked the nest to the ground.
The boys fled for the safety of the porch, but Daddy only stood over the nest,
swaying and blinking down at it. Jacky crept back to see. A few wasps were
crawling sluggishly over the paper terrain of their property, but they were not
trying to fly. From the inside of the nest, the black and alien place, came a
never-to-be-forgotten sound: a low, somnolent buzz, like the sound of hightension wires.
<div class="bookquote">``Why don't they try to sting you, Daddy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) had asked.
<div class="bookquote">``The smoke makes em drunk, Jacky. Go get my gascan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) ran to fetch it. Daddy doused the nest with amber gasoline.
<div class="bookquote">``Now step away, Jacky, unless you want to lose your eyebrows.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) had stepped away. From somewhere in the voluminous folds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) white
overblouse, Daddy had produced a wooden kitchen match. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) lit it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>)
thumbnail and flung it onto the nest. There had been a white-orange explosion,
almost soundless in its ferocity. Daddy had stepped away, cackling wildly. The
wasps' nest had gone up in no time.
<div class="bookquote">``Fire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacky</b></font>)</div>Daddy had said, turning to Jacky with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``Fire will kill
anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>After supper the boys had come out in the day's waning light to stand solemnly
around the charred and blackened nest. From the hot interior had come the sound
of wasp bodies popping like corn.
The pressure gauge stood at two-twenty. A low iron wailing sound was building
up in the guts of the thing. Jets of steam stood out erect in a hundred places
like porcupine quills.
-LRB-Fire will kill anything.-RRB-
Jack suddenly started. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been dozing off ... and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had almost dozed

<p/>himself right into kingdom cone. What in God's name had he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) been thinking of?
Protecting the hotel was his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) job. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was the caretaker.
A sweat of terror sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands so quickly that at first he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) missed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
grip on the large valve. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) curled his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fingers around its spokes. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
whirled it one turn, two, three. There was a giant hiss of steam, dragon's
breath. A warm tropical mist rose from beneath the boiler and veiled him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). For a
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could no longer see the dial but thought he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) must have waited too long;
the groaning, clanking sound inside the boiler increased, followed by a series
of heavy rattling sounds and the wrenching screech of metal.
When some of the steam blew away he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saw that the pressure gauge had dropped
back to two hundred and was still sinking. The jets of steam escaping around the
soldered patches began to lose their force. The wrenching, grinding sounds began
to diminish.
One-ninety... one-eighty ... one seventy-five ...
-LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was going downhill, going ninety miles an hour, when the whistle broke
into a scream -- -RRB-
But he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) didn't think it would blow now. The press was down to one-sixty.
-LRB- -- they found him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in the wreck with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand on the throttle, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was scalded
to death by the steam.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stepped away from the boiler, breathing hard, trembling. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
hands and saw that blisters were already rising on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) palms. Hell with the
blisters, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought, and laughed shakily. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had almost died with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand on
the throttle, like Casey the engineer in <div class="bookquote">``The Wreck of the Old 97.''  (<font color='red'><b>Casey the engineer</b></font>)</div>Worse still,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casey</b></font>) would have killed the Overlook. The final crashing failure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casey</b></font>) had failed as
a teacher, a writer, a husband, and a father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had even failed as a drunk. But
you couldn't do much better in the old failure category than to blow up the
building you were supposed to be taking care of. And this was no ordinary
building.
By no means.
Christ, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) needed a drink.
The press had dropped down to eighty psi. Cautiously, wincing a little at the
pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) closed the dump valve again. But from now on the boiler
would have to be watched more closely than ever. It might have been seriously
weakened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) wouldn't trust it at more than one hundred psi for the rest of the
winter. And if they were a little chilly, they would just have to grin and bear
it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had broken two of the blisters. His (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) hands throbbed like rotten teeth.
A drink. A drink would fix him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) up, and there wasn't a thing in the goddamn
house besides cooking sherry. At this point a drink would be medicinal. That was
just it, by God. An anesthetic. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had done his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) duty and now he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could use a
little anesthetic -- something stronger than Excedrin. But there was nothing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) remembered bottles glittering in the shadows.
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had saved the hotel. The hotel would want to reward him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt sure of
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) handkerchief out of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) back pocket and went to the stairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
rubbed at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mouth. Just a little drink. Just one. To ease the pain.
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had served the Overlook, and now the Overlook would serve him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was sure
of it. His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) feet on the stair risers were quick and eager, the hurrying steps of
a man who has come home from a long and bitter war. It was 5:20 A.M., MST.

<p/><< 41 >>
DAYLIGHT
Danny awoke with a muffled gasp from a terrible dream. There had been an
explosion. A fire. The Overlook was burning up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mommy were watching
it from the front lawn.
Mommy had said: <div class="bookquote">``Look, Danny, look at the hedges.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked at them and they were all dead. Their leaves had turned a suffocant
brown. The tightly packed branches showed through like the skeletons of halfdismembered corpses. And then his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy had burst out of the Overlook's big
double doors, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was burning like a torch. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) clothes were in flames, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
skin had acquired a dark and sinister tan that was growing darker by the moment,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hair was a burning bush.
That was when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) woke up, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) throat tight with fear, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands clutching at
the sheet and blankets. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) screamed? He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked over at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother. Wendy lay
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) side, the blankets up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) chin, a sheaf of straw-colored hair lying
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cheek. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked like a child herself. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hadn't screamed.
Lying in bed, looking upward, the nightmare began to drain away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had a
curious feeling that some great tragedy
-LRB-fire? explosion?-RRB-
had been averted by inches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind drift out, searching for his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
daddy, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) standing somewhere below. In the lobby. Danny pushed a
little harder, trying to get inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father. It was not good. Because Daddy
was thinking about the Bad Thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was thinking how

tis the season and none of us are-RRB-
-LRB-GET OUT OF HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) MIND, YOU LITTLE SHIT!-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) recoiled in terror from that mental voice, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes widening, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands
tightening into claws on the counterpane. It hadn't been the voice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father
but a clever mimic. A voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knew. Hoarse, brutal, yet underpointed with a
vacuous sort of humor.
Was it so near, then?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) threw the covers back and swung his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) feet out onto the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) kicked his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
slippers out from under the bed and put them on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went to the door and pulled
it open and hurried up to the main corridor, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) slippered feet whispering on
the nap of the carpet runner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) turned the corner.

<p/>There was a man on all fours halfway down the corridor, between him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and the
stairs.
Danny froze.
The man looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes were tiny and red. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was dressed in some
sort of silvery, spangled costume. A dog costume, Danny realized. Protruding
from the rump of this strange creation was a long and floppy tail with a puff on
the end. A zipper ran up the back of the costume to the neck. To the left of him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
was a dog's or wolf's head, blank eyesockets above the muzzle, the mouth open in
a meaningless snarl that showed the rug's black and blue pattern between fangs
that appeared to be papier-mache.
The man's mouth and chin and cheeks were smeared with blood.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to growl at Danny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was grinning, but the growl was real. It was
deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) throat, a chilling primitive sound. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) began to bark. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) teeth
were also stained red. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) began to crawl toward Danny, dragging his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) boneless
tail behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). The costume dog's head lay unheeded on the carpet, glaring
vacantly over Danny's shoulder.
<div class="bookquote">``Let me by,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm going to eat you, little boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the dogman answered, and suddenly a
fusillade of barks came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) grinning mouth. They were human imitations, but
the savagery in them was real. The man's hair was dark, greased with sweat from
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confining costume. There was a mixture of scotch and champagne on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
breath.
Danny flinched back but didn't run. <div class="bookquote">``Let me by.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the dogman replied. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) small red
eyes were fixed attentively on Danny's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) continued to grin. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to
eat you up, little boy. And I think I'll start with your plump little cock.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) began to prance skittishly forward, making little leaps and snarling.
Danny's nerve broke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fled back into the short hallway that led to their
quarters, looking back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shoulder. There was a series of mixed howls and
barks and growls, broken by slurred mutterings and giggles.
Danny stood in the hallway, trembling.
<div class="bookquote">``Get it up!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the drunken dogman cried out from around the corner. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) voice
was both violent and despairing. <div class="bookquote">``Get it up, Harry you bitch-bastard! I don't
care how many casinos and airlines and movie companies you own! I know what you
like in the privacy of your own h-home! Get it up! I'll huff... and I'll puff
... until Harry Derwent's all bloowwwwn down!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ended with a long, chilling
howl that seemed to turn into a scream of rage and pain just before it dwindled
off.
Danny turned apprehensively to the closed bedroom door at the end of the
hallway and walked quietly down to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) opened it and poked his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head through.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mommy was sleeping in exactly the same position. No one was hearing this but
him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) closed the door softly and went back up to the intersection of their
corridor and the main hall, hoping the dogman would be gone, the way the blood
on the walls of the Presidential Suite had been gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) peeked around the
corner carefully.
The man in the dog costume was still there. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head back on and
was now prancing on all fours by the stairwell, chasing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tail. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)

<p/>occasionally leaped off the rug and came down making dog grunts in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat.
<div class="bookquote">``Woof! Woof! Bowwowwow! Grrrrrr!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>These sounds came hollowly out of the mask's stylized snarling mouth, and
among them were sounds that might have been sobs or laughter.
Danny went back to the bedroom and sat down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) cot, covering his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands. The hotel was running things now. Maybe at first the things that had
happened had only been accidents. Maybe at first the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had seen really
were like scary pictures that couldn't hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). But now the hotel was
controlling those things and they could hurt. The Overlook hadn't wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) to
go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father. That might spoil all the fun. So it had put the dogman in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
way, just as it had put the hedge animals between them and the road.
But his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy could come here. And sooner or later his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy would.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) began to cry, the tears rolling silently down his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) cheeks. It was too late.
They were going to die, all three of them, and when the Overlook opened next
late spring, they would be right here to greet the guests along with the rest of
the spooks. The woman in the tub. The dogman. The horrible dark thing that had
been in the cement tunnel. They would be --
-LRB-Stop! Stop that now!-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knuckled the tears furiously from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would try as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
could to keep that from happening. Not to himself, not to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy and mommy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would try as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes and sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind out in a high, hard crystal bolt.
-LRB-!!! DICK PLEASE COME QUICK WE'RE IN BAD
TROUBLE DICK WE NEED-RRB-
And suddenly, in the darkness behind his (<font color='blue'><b>DICK</b></font>) eyes the thing that chased him (<font color='blue'><b>DICK</b></font>) down
the Overlook's dark halls in his (<font color='blue'><b>DICK</b></font>) dreams was there, right there, a huge creature
dressed in white, its prehistoric club raised over its head:
<div class="bookquote">``I'll make you stop it! You goddam puppy! I'll make you stop it because I am
your FATHER!''
 (<font color='red'><b>a creature</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>DICK</b></font>) jerked back to the reality of the bedroom, his (<font color='blue'><b>DICK</b></font>) eyes wide and staring,
the screams tumbling helplessly from his (<font color='blue'><b>DICK</b></font>) mouth as his (<font color='blue'><b>DICK</b></font>) mother bolted awake,
clutching the sheet to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breasts.
<div class="bookquote">``No Daddy no no no -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And they both heard the vicious, descending swing of the invisible club,
cutting the air somewhere very close, then fading away to silence as he (<font color='blue'><b>DICK</b></font>) ran to
his (<font color='blue'><b>DICK</b></font>) mother and hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), trembling like a rabbit in a snare.
The Overlook was not going to let him (<font color='blue'><b>DICK</b></font>) call Dick. That might spoil the fun,
too.
They were alone.
Outside the snow came harder, curtaining them off from the world.

<p/>MID-AIR
Dick Hallorann's flight was called at 6:45 A.M., EST, and the boarding clerk
held him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) by Gate 31, shifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) flight bag nervously from hand to hand, until
the last call at 6:55. They were both looking for a man named Carlton Vecker,
the only passenger on TWA's flight 196 from Miami to Denver who hadn't checked
in.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>the clerk said, and issued Hallorann a blue firstclass boarding pass.
<div class="bookquote">``You lucked out. You can board, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann hurried up the enclosed boarding ramp and let the mechanically
grinning stewardess tear his (<font color='blue'><b>Vecker</b></font>) pass off and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Vecker</b></font>) the stub.
<div class="bookquote">``We're serving breakfast on the flight,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the stew said. <div class="bookquote">``If you'd like -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just coffee, babe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vecker</b></font>) said, and went down the aisle to a seat in the smoking
section. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vecker</b></font>) kept expecting the no-show Vecker to pop through the door like a
jack-in-the-box at the last second. The woman in the seat by the window was
reading You Can Be Your Own Best Friend with a sour, unbelieving expression on
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face. Hallorann buckled his (<font color='blue'><b>Friend</b></font>) seat belt and then wrapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Friend</b></font>) large black hands
around the seat's armrests and promised the absent Carlton Vecker that it would
take him (<font color='blue'><b>Vecker</b></font>) and five strong TWA flight attendants to drag him (<font color='blue'><b>Vecker</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vecker</b></font>) seat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vecker</b></font>)
kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Vecker</b></font>) eye on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vecker</b></font>) watch. It dragged off the minutes to the 7:00 takeoff time
with maddening slowness.
At 7:05 the stewardess informed them that there would be a slight delay while
the ground crew rechecked one of the latches on the cargo door.
<div class="bookquote">``Shit for brains,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Hallorann/DICK</b></font>)</div>Dick Hallorann muttered.
The sharp-faced woman turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sour, unbelieving expression on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) and then
went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) book.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) had spent the night at the airport, going from counter to counter -- United,
American, TWA, Continental, Braniff -- haunting the ticket clerks. Sometime after
midnight, drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) eighth or ninth cup of coffee in the canteen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) had
decided he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) was being an asshole to have taken this whole thing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) own
shoulders. There were authorities. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) had gone down to the nearest bank of
telephones, and after talking to three different operators, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) had gotten the
emergency number of the Rocky Mountain National Park Authority.
The man who answered the telephone sounded utterly worn out. Hallorann had
given a false name and said there was trouble at the Overlook Hotel, west of
Sidewinder. Bad trouble.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was put on hold.
The ranger -LRB-Hallorann assumed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a ranger-RRB- came back on in about five
minutes.
<div class="bookquote">``They've got a CB,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ranger</b></font>)</div>the ranger said.
<div class="bookquote">``Sure they've got a CB,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said.
<div class="bookquote">``We haven't had a Mayday call from them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Man, that don't matter. They -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Exactly what kind of trouble are they in, Mr. Hall?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's a family. The caretaker and his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) family. I think maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>)'s gone
a little nuts, you know. I think maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) might hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) little
boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask how you've come by this information, sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann closed his (<font color='blue'><b>ranger</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``What's your name, fellow?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tom Staunton, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, Tom, I know. Now I'll be just as straight with you as I can be. There's
bad trouble up there. Maybe killin bad, do you dig what I'm sayin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hall, I really have to know how you -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann had said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm telling you I know. A few years back there
was a fellow up there name of Grady. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) killed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) two daughters
and then pulled the string on himself. I'm telling you it's going to happen
again if you guys don't haul your asses out there and stop it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hall, you're not calling from Colorado.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. But what difference -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If you're not in Colorado, you're not in CB range of the Overlook Hotel. If
you're not in CB range you can't possibly have been in contact with the, uh ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Faint rattle of papers. <div class="bookquote">``The Torrance family. While I had you on hold I tried
to telephone. It's out, which is nothing unusual. There are still twenty-five
miles of aboveground telephone lines between the hotel and the Sidewinder
switching station. My conclusion is that you must be some sort of crank.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh man, you stupid ...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But his (<font color='blue'><b>ranger</b></font>) despair was too great to find a noun to go
with the adjective. Suddenly, illumination. <div class="bookquote">``Call them!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>ranger</b></font>) cried.
<div class="bookquote">``Sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You got the CB, they got the CB. So call them! Call them and ask them what's
up!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a brief silence, and the humming of long-distance wires.
<div class="bookquote">``You tried that too, didn't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann asked. <div class="bookquote">``That's why you had me on
hold so long. You tried the phone and then you tried the CB and you didn't get
nothing but you don't think nothing's wrong ... what are you guys doing up
there? Sitting on your asses and playing gin rummy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, we are not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Staunton said angrily. Hallorann was relieved at the sound
of anger in the voice. For the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>ranger</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>ranger</b></font>) was speaking to a man and
not to a recording. <div class="bookquote">``I'm the only man here, sir. Every other ranger in the park,
plus game wardens, plus volunteers, are up in Hasty Notch, risking their lives
because three stupid assholes with six months' experience decided to try the
north face of King's Ram. They're stuck halfway up there and maybe they'll get
down and maybe they won't. There are two choppers up there and the men who are
flying them are risking their lives because it's night here and it's starting to
snow. So if you're still having trouble putting it all together, I'll give you a
hand with it. Number one, I don't have anybody to send to the Overlook. Number
two, the Overlook isn't a priority here -- what happens in the park is a priority.
Number three, by daybreak neither one of those choppers will be able to fly
because it's going to snow like crazy, according to the National Weather
Service. Do you understand the situation?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann had said softly. <div class="bookquote">``I understand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now my guess as to why I couldn't raise them on the CB is very simple. I
don't know what time it is where you are, but out here it's nine-thirty. I think
they may have turned it off and gone to bed. Now if you -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good luck with your climbers, man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. ``But I want you to know
that they are not the only ones who are stuck up high because they didn't know

<p/>what they were getting into.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>ranger</b></font>) had hung up the phone.
***
At 7:20 A.M. the TWA 747 backed lumberingly out of its stall, turned, and
rolled out toward the runway. Hallorann let out a long, soundless exhale.
Carlton Vecker, wherever you are, eat your heart out.
Flight 196 parted company with the ground at 7:28, and at 7:31, as it gained
altitude, the thought-pistol went off in Dick Hallorann's head again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>)
shoulders hunched uselessly against the smell of oranges and then jerked
spasmodically. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) forehead wrinkled, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) mouth drew down in a grimace of pain.
-LRB-!!! DICK PLEASE COME QUICK WE'RE IN BAD
TROUBLE DICK WE NEED-RRB-
And that was all. It was suddenly gone. No fading out this time. The
communication had been chopped off cleanly, as if with a knife. It scared him (<font color='blue'><b>DICK</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>DICK</b></font>) hands, still clutching the seat rests, had gone almost white. His (<font color='blue'><b>DICK</b></font>) mouth was
dry. Something had happened to the boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>DICK</b></font>) was sure of it. If anyone had hurt
that little child --
``Do you always react so violently to takeoffs?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>DICK</b></font>) looked around. It was the woman in the horn-rimmed glasses.
``It wasn't that,'' Hallorann said. ``I've got a steel plate in my head. From
Korea. Every now and then it gives me a twinge. Vibrates, don't you know.
Scrambles the signal.''
``Is that so?''
``Yes, ma'am.''
``It is the line soldier who ultimately pays for any foreign intervention,'' the
sharp-faced woman said grimly.
``Is that so?''
<div class="bookquote">``It is. This country must swear off its dirty little wars. The CIA has been at
the root of every dirty little war America has fought in this century. The CIA
and dollar diplomacy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) book and began to read. The No SMOKING sign went off. Hallorann
watched the receding land and wondered if the boy was all right. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had
developed an affectionate feeling for that boy, although his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) folks hadn't seemed
all that much.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hoped to God they were watching out for Danny.

<p/><< 43 >>
DRINKS ON THE HOUSE

<p/>Jack stood in the dining room just outside the batwing doors leading into the
Colorado Lounge, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head cocked, listening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was smiling faintly.
Around him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could hear the Overlook Hotel coming to life.
It was hard to say just how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knew, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) guessed it wasn't greatly
different from the perceptions Danny had from time to time ... like father,
like son. Wasn't that how it was popularly expressed?
It wasn't a perception of sight or sound, although it was very near to those
things, separated from those senses by the filmiest of perceptual curtains. It
was as if another Overlook now lay scant inches beyond this one, separated from
the real world -LRB-if there is such a thing as a <div class="bookquote">``real world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack thought-RRB- but
gradually coming into balance with it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was reminded of the 3-D movies he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'d
seen as a kid. If you looked at the screen without the special glasses, you saw
a double image -- the sort of thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was feeling now. But when you put the
glasses on, it made sense.
All the hotel's eras were together now, all but this current one, the Torrance
Era. And this would be together with the rest very soon now. That was good. That
was very good.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) could almost hear the self-important ding!ding! of the silver-plated bell
on the registration desk, summoning bellboys to the front as men in the
fashionable flannels of the 1920s checked in and men in fashionable 1940s
double-breasted pinstripes checked out. There would be three nuns sitting in
front of the fireplace as they waited for the check-out line to thin, and
standing behind them, nattily dressed with diamond stickpins holding their blueand-white-figured ties, Charles Grondin and Vito Gienelli discussed profit and
loss, life and death. There were a dozen trucks in the loading bays out back,
some laid one over the other like bad time exposures. In the east-wing ballroom,
a dozen different business conventions were going on at the same time within
temporal centimeters of each other. There was a costume ball going on. There
were soirees, wedding receptions, birthday and anniversary parties. Men talking
about Neville Chamberlain and the Archduke of Austria. Music. Laughter.
Drunkenness. Hysteria. Little love, not here, but a steady undercurrent of
sensuousness. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlain</b></font>) could almost hear all of them together, drifting through
the hotel and making a graceful cacophony. In the dining room where he (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlain</b></font>) stood,
breakfast, lunch, and dinner for seventy years were all being served
simultaneously just behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlain</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlain</b></font>) could almost ... no, strike the almost. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlain</b></font>)
could hear them, faintly as yet, but clearly -- the way one can hear thunder miles
off on a hot summer's day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlain</b></font>) could hear all of them, the beautiful strangers.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlain</b></font>) was becoming aware of them as they must have been aware of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chamberlain</b></font>) from the very
start.
All the rooms of the Overlook were occupied this morning.
A full house.
And beyond the batwings, a low murmur of conversation drifted and swirled like
lazy cigarette smoke. More sophisticated, more private. Low, throaty female
laughter, the kind that seems to vibrate in a fairy ring around the viscera and
the genitals. The sound of a cash register, its window softly lighted in the
warm halfdark, ringing up the price of a gin rickey, a Manhattan, a depression
bomber, a sloe gin fizz, a zombie. The jukebox, pouring out its drinkers'
melodies, each one overlapping the other in time.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>zombie</b></font>) pushed the batwings open and stepped through
<div class="bookquote">``Hello, boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Jack Torrance said softly. <div class="bookquote">``I've been away but now I'm back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good evening, Mr. Torrance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lloyd</b></font>)</div>Lloyd said, genuinely pleased. <div class="bookquote">``It's good to see
you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's good to be back, Lloyd,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) said gravely, and hooked his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) leg over a
stool between a man in a sharp blue suit and a bleary-eyed woman in a black
dress who was peering into the depths of a singapore sling.
<div class="bookquote">``What will it be, Mr. Torrance?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Martini,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) said with great pleasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) looked at the backbar with its rows
of dimly gleaming bottles, capped with their silver siphons. Jim Beam. Wild
Turkey. Gilby's. Sharrod's Private Label. Toro. Seagram's. And home again.
<div class="bookquote">``One large martian, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Beam</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They've landed somewhere in the
world, Lloyd.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beam</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Beam</b></font>) wallet out and laid a twenty carefully on the bar.
As Lloyd made his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) drink, Jack looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shoulder. Every booth was
occupied. Some of the occupants were dressed in costumes ... a woman in gauzy
harem pants and a rhinestone-sparkled brassiere, a man with a foxhead rising
slyly out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) evening dress, a man in a silvery dog outfit who was tickling
the nose of a woman in a sarong with the puff on the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long tail, to
the general amusement of all.
<div class="bookquote">``No charge to you, Mr. Torrance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lloyd</b></font>)</div>Lloyd said, putting the drink down on Jack's
twenty. <div class="bookquote">``Your money is no good here. Orders from the manager.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Manager?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>A faint unease came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>); nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) picked up the martini glass and
swirled it, watching the olive at the bottom bob slightly in the drink's chilly
depths.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course. The manager.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lloyd</b></font>)</div>Lloyd's smile broadened, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) eyes were socketed
in shadow and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) skin was horribly white, like the skin of a corpse. <div class="bookquote">``Later he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>)
expects to see to your son's well-being himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) is very interested in your
son. Danny is a talented boy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The juniper fumes of the gin were pleasantly maddening, but they also seemed
to be blurring his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) reason. Danny? What was all of this about Danny? And what was
he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) doing in a bar with a drink in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had TAKEN THE PLEDGE. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had GONE ON THE WAGON. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had SWORN OFF.
What could they want with his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) son? What could they want with Danny? Wendy and
Danny weren't in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tried to see into Lloyd's shadowed eyes, but it was too
dark, too dark, it was like trying to read emotion into the empty orbs of a
skull.
-LRB-It's me they must want ... isn't it? I am the one. Not Danny, not Wendy.
I'm the one who loves it here. They wanted to leave. I'm the one who took care
of the snowmobile ... went through the old records ... dumped the press on
the boiler ... lied ... practically sold my soul ... what can they want
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)?-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``Where is the manager?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tried to ask it casually but his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) words seemed to
come out between lips already numbed by the first drink, like words from a
nightmare rather than those in a sweet dream.
Lloyd only smiled.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you want with my son? Danny's not in this ... is he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) heard the
naked plea in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) own voice.

<p/>Lloyd's face seemed to be running, changing, becoming something pestilent. The
white skin becoming a hepatitic yellow, cracking. Red sores erupting on the
skin, bleeding foul smelling liquid. Droplets of blood sprang out on Lloyd's
forehead like sweat and somewhere a silver chime was striking the quarter-hour.
-LRB-Unmask, unmask!-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``Drink your drink, Mr. Torrance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lloyd</b></font>)</div>Lloyd said softly. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't a matter that
concerns you. Not at this point.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) picked his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) drink up again, raised it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) lips, and hesitated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) heard
the hard, horrible snap as Danny's arm broke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) saw the bicycle flying brokenly
up over the hood of Al's car, starring the windshield. He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) saw a single wheel
lying in the road, twisted spokes pointing into the sky like jags of piano wire.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) became aware that all conversation had stopped.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) looked back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) shoulder. They were all looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Al</b></font>) expectantly,
silently. The man beside the woman in the sarong had removed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) foxhead and
Jack saw that it was Horace Derwent, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pallid blond hair spilling across his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
forehead. Everyone at the bar was watching, too. The woman beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) closely, as if trying to focus. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress had slipped off one
shoulder and looking down he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could see a loosely puckered nipple capping one
sagging breast. Looking back at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) began to think that this might be
the woman from 217, the one who had tried to strangle Danny. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) other hand,
the man in the sharp blue suit had removed a small pearl-handled .32 from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
jacket pocket and was idly spinning it on the bar, like a man with Russian
roulette on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind.
-LRB-I want -- -RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) realized the words were not passing through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) frozen vocal cords and
tried again.
<div class="bookquote">``I want to see the manager. I ... I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) understands. My son is
not a part of this. He (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) ... ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lloyd</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Torrance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lloyd</b></font>)</div>Lloyd said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) voice coming with hideous gentleness from
inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) plague-raddled face, <div class="bookquote">``you will meet the manager in due time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) has,
in fact, decided to make you his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) agent in this matter. Now drink your drink.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lloyd</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Drink your drink,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>they all echoed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) picked it up with a badly trembling hand. It was raw gin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) looked into
it, and looking was like drowning.
The woman beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) began to sing in a flat, dead voice: <div class="bookquote">``Roll ... out...
the barrel ... and we'll have... a barrel ... of fun...''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Lloyd picked it up. Then the man in the blue suit. The dog-man joined in,
thumping one paw against the table
<div class="bookquote">``Now's the time to roll the barrel -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Derwent/Horace Derwent</b></font>)</div>Derwent added his (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) voice to the rest. A cigarette was cocked in one corner of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) mouth at a jaunty angle. His (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) right arm was around the shoulders of the woman
in the sarong, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) right band was gently and absently stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) right
breast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) was looking at the dog-man with amused contempt as he (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) sang.
<div class="bookquote">'' -- because the gang's ... all ... here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Jack brought the drink to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mouth and downed it in three long gulps, the gin
highballing down his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) throat like a moving van in a tunnel, exploding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
stomach, rebounding up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) brain in one leap where it seized hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) with
a final convulsing fit of the shakes.

<p/>When that passed off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) felt fine.
<div class="bookquote">``Do it again, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, and pushed the empty glass toward Lloyd.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lloyd</b></font>)</div>Lloyd said, taking the glass. Lloyd looked perfectly normal again.
The olive-skinned man had put his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) .32 away. The woman on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) right was staring
into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) singapore sling again. One breast was wholly exposed now, leaning on
the bar's leather buffer. A vacuous crooning noise came from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) slack mouth.
The loom of conversation had begun again, weaving and weaving.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) new drink appeared in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">'' Muchas gracias, Lloyd,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) said, picking it up.
<div class="bookquote">``Always a pleasure to serve you, Mr. Torrance.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lloyd</b></font>)</div>Lloyd smiled.
<div class="bookquote">``You were always the best of them, Lloyd.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, thank you, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) drank slowly this time, letting it trickle down his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) throat, tossing a few
peanuts down the chute for good luck.
The drink was gone in no time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) ordered another. Mr. President, I have
met the martians and am pleased to report they are friendly. While Lloyd fixed
another, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) began searching his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) pockets for a quarter to put in the jukebox. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>)
thought of Danny again, but Danny's face was pleasantly fuzzed and nondescript
now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had hurt Danny once, but that had been before he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had learned how to
handle his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) liquor. Those days were behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would never hurt Danny
again.
Not for the world.

CONVERSATIONS AT THE PARTY
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was dancing with a beautiful woman.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had no idea what time it was, how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had spent in the Colorado Lounge
or how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had been here in the ballroom. Time had ceased to matter.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had vague memories: listening to a man who had once been a successful radio
comic and then a variety star in TV, infant days telling a very long and very
hilarious joke about incest between Siamese twins; seeing the woman in the harem
pants and the sequined bra do a slow and sinuous striptease to some bumping-andgrinding music from the jukebox -LRB-it seemed it had been David Rose's theme music
from The Stripper-RRB-; crossing the lobby as one of three, the other two men in
evening dress that predated the twenties, all of them singing about the stiff
patch on Rosie O'Grady's knickers. He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Grady</b></font>) seemed to remember looking out the big
double doors and seeing Japanese lanterns strung in graceful, curving arcs that
followed the sweep of the driveway -- they gleamed in soft pastel colors like
dusky jewels. The big glass globe on the porch ceiling was on, and night-insects
bumped and flittered against it, and a part of him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Grady</b></font>), perhaps the last tiny spark

<p/>of sobriety, tried to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Grady</b></font>) that it was 6 A.M. on a morning in December. But
time had been canceled.
-LRB-The arguments against insanity fall through with a soft shurring sound/layer
on layer ...-RRB-
Who was that? Some poet he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) had read as an undergraduate? Some undergraduate
poet who was now selling washers in Wausau or insurance in Indianapolis? Perhaps
an original thought? Didn't matter.
-LRB-The night is dark/ the stars are high/ a disembodied custard pie/ is floating
in the sky ...-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) giggled helplessly.
<div class="bookquote">``What's funny, honey?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And here he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) was again, in the ballroom. The chandelier was lit and couples
were circling all around them, some in costume and some not, to the smooth
sounds of some postwar band -- but which war? Can you be certain?
No, of course not. He (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) was certain of only one thing: he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) was dancing with a
beautiful woman.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was tall and auburn-haired, dressed in clinging white satin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
dancing close to him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breasts pressed softly and sweetly against his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) chest.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) white hand was entwined in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was wearing a small and sparkly cat`seye mask and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair had been brushed over to one side in a soft and gleaming
fall that seemed to pool in the valley between their touching shoulders. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
dress was full-skirted but be could feel her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thighs against his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) legs from time
to time and had become more and more sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was smooth-and-powdered naked
under her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress,
-LRB-the better to feet your erection with, my dear-RRB-
and he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) was sporting a regular railspike. If it offended her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) concealed it
well; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) snuggled even closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing funny, honey,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) said, and giggled again.
<div class="bookquote">``I like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whispered, and he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) scent was like lilies,
secret and hidden in cracks furred with green moss -- places where sunshine is
short and shadows long.
<div class="bookquote">``I like you, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We could go upstairs, if you want. I'm supposed to be with Harry, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'ll
never notice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s too busy teasing poor Roger.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The number ended. There was a spatter of applause and then the band swung into
<div class="bookquote">``Mood Indigo''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>with scarcely a pause.
Jack looked over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bare shoulder and saw Derwent standing by the refreshment
table. The girl in the sarong was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>). There were bottles of champagne in
ice buckets ranged along the white lawn covering the table, and Derwent held a
foaming bottle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) hand. A knot of people had gathered, laughing. In front of
Derwent and the girl in the sarong, Roger capered grotesquely on all fours, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
tail dragging limply behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was barking.
<div class="bookquote">``Speak, boy, speak!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Derwent</b></font>)</div>Harry Derwent cried.
<div class="bookquote">``Rowf! Rowf!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger</b></font>)</div>Roger responded. Everyone clapped; a few of the men whistled.
<div class="bookquote">``Now sit up. Sit up, doggy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Roger</b></font>)</div>Roger clambered up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) haunches. The muzzle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mask was frozen in its
eternal snarl. Inside the eyeholes, Roger's eyes rolled with frantic, sweaty
hilarity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) arms out, dangling the paws.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rowf! Rowf!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Derwent upended the bottle of champagne and it fell in a foamy Niagara onto
the upturned mask. Roger made frantic slurping sounds, and everyone applauded
again. Some of the women screamed with laughter.
<div class="bookquote">``Isn't Harry a card?''  (<font color='red'><b>partner</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) partner asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), pressing close again. <div class="bookquote">``Everyone
says so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s AC/DC, you know. Poor Roger's only DC. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) spent a weekend with
Harry in Cuba once ... oh, months ago. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) follows Harry everywhere,
wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) little tail behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Everyone</b></font>) giggled. The shy scent of lilies drifted up.
<div class="bookquote">``But of course Harry never goes back for seconds ... not on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) DC side,
anyway ... and Roger is just wild. Harry told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) came to the masked
ball as a doggy, a cute little doggy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might reconsider, and Roger is such a
silly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The number ended. There was more applause. The band members were filing down
for a break.
<div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, sweetness,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Everyone</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``There's someone I just roust ... Darla!
Darla, you dear girl, where have you been?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Everyone</b></font>) wove her (<font color='blue'><b>Everyone</b></font>) way into the eating, drinking throng and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) gazed after her (<font color='blue'><b>Everyone</b></font>)
stupidly, wondering how they had happened to be dancing together in the first
place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) didn't remember. Incidents seemed to have occurred with no
connections. First here, then there, then everywhere. His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) head was spinning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
smelled lilies and juniper berries. Up by the refreshment table Derwent was now
holding a tiny triangular sandwich over Roger's head and urging him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), to the
general merriment of the onlookers, to do a somersault. The dogmask was turned
upward. The silver sides of the dog costume bellowsed in and out. Roger suddenly
leaped, tucking his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) head under, and tried to roll in mid-air. His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) leap was too
low and too exhausted; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) landed awkwardly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) back, rapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) head smartly
on the tiles. A hollow groan drifted out of the dogmask.
Derwent led the applause. <div class="bookquote">``Try again, doggy! Try again!''  (<font color='red'><b>The onlookers</b></font>)</div>The onlookers took up
the chant -- try again, try again -- and Jack staggered off the other way, feeling
vaguely ill.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) almost fell over the drinks cart that was being wheeled along by a lowbrowed man in a white mess jacket. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) foot rapped the lower chromed shelf of
the cart; the bottles and siphons on top chattered together musically.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said thickly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) suddenly felt closed in and claustrophobic; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
wanted to get out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wanted the Overlook back the way it had been ... free of
these unwanted guests. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) place was not honored, as the true opener of the way;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was only another of the ten thousand cheering extras, a doggy rolling over
and sitting up on command.
<div class="bookquote">``Quite all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man in the white mess jacket said. The polite, clipped
English coming from that thug's face was surreal. <div class="bookquote">``A drink?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Martini.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>From behind him (<font color='blue'><b>thug</b></font>), another comber of laughter broke; Roger was howling to the
tune of <div class="bookquote">``Home on the Range.''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger</b></font>)</div>Someone was picking out accompaniment on the
Steinway baby grand.
<div class="bookquote">``Here you are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The frosty cold glass was pressed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hand. Jack drank gratefully,
feeling the gin hit and crumble away the first inroads of sobriety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it all right, sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The cart began to roll again.
Jack suddenly reached out and touched the man's shoulder.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me, but... what's your name?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The other showed no surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you ... I mean that...''
 (<font color='red'><b>The bartender</b></font>)</div>The bartender was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) politely. Jack tried again, although his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
mouth was mushed by gin and unreality; each word felt as large as an ice cube.
<div class="bookquote">``Weren't you once the caretaker here? When you ... when...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
couldn't finish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) couldn't say it.
<div class="bookquote">``Why no, sir. I don't believe so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``But your wife ... your daughters. .
``My wife is helping in the kitchen, sir. The girls are asleep, of course. It's
much too late for them.''
``You were the caretaker. You -- '' Oh say it! ``You killed them.''
Grady's face remained blankly polite. ``I don't have any recollection of that
at all, sir.'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) glass was empty. Grady plucked it from Jack's unresisting
fingers and set about making another drink for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>). There was a small white
plastic bucket on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) cart that was filled with olives. For some reason
they reminded Jack of tiny severed heads. Grady speared one deftly, dropped it
into the glass, and handed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>).
``But you -- ''
``You're the caretaker, sir,'' Grady said mildly. ``You've always been the
caretaker. I should know, sir. I've always been here. The same manager hired us
both, at the same time. Is it all right, sir?''
Jack gulped at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) drink. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head was swirling. ``Mr. Ullman -- ''
``I know no one by that name, sir.''
``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ullman</b></font>) -- ''
``The manager,'' Grady said. ``The hotel, sir. Surely you realize who hired you,
sir.''
``No,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) said thickly. ``No, I -- ''
``I believe you must take it up further with your son, Mr. Torrance, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>)
understands everything, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) hasn't enlightened you. Rather naughty of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>), if I may be so bold, sir. In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>)'s crossed you at almost every turn,
hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>)? And him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) not yet six.''
``Yes,'' Jack said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) has.'' There was another wave of laughter from behind
them.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) needs to be corrected, if you don't mind me saying so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) needs a good
talking-to, and perhaps a bit more. My own girls, sir, didn't care for the
Overlook at first. One of them actually stole a pack of my matches and tried to
burn it down. I corrected them. I corrected them most harshly. And when my wife
tried to stop me from doing my duty, I corrected her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) offered Jack a bland,
meaningless smile. ``I find it a sad but true fact that women rarely understand a
father's responsibility to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) children. Husbands and fathers do have certain
responsibilities, don't they, sir?''
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Jack said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They didn't love the Overlook as I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grady/Delbert Grady</b></font>)</div>Grady said, beginning to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>)
another drink. Silver bubbles rose in the upended gin bottle. <div class="bookquote">``Just as your son
and wife don't love it. Not at present, anyway. But they will come to love it.
You must show them the error of their ways, Mr. Torrance. Do you agree?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) did see. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) had been too easy with them. Husbands and fathers did have
certain responsibilities. Father Knows Best. They did not understand. That in
itself was no crime, but they were willfully not understanding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was not
ordinarily a harsh man. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) did believe in punishment. And if his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) son and his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
wife had willfully set themselves against his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) wishes, against the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) knew
were best for them, then didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) have a certain duty -- ?
<div class="bookquote">``A thankless child is sharper than a serpent's tooth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grady/Delbert Grady</b></font>)</div>Grady said, handing him (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) drink. <div class="bookquote">``I do believe that the manager could bring your son into line. And
your wife would shortly follow. Do you agree, sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) was suddenly uncertain. <div class="bookquote">``I ... but ... if they could just leave ... I
mean, after all, it's me the manager wants, isn't it? It must be. Because -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Because why? He (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) should know but suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) didn't. Oh, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) poor brain was
swimming.
<div class="bookquote">``Bad dog!''  (<font color='red'><b>Derwent/Horace Derwent</b></font>)</div>Derwent was saying loudly, to a counterpoint of laughter. <div class="bookquote">``Bad dog
to piddle on the floor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grady/Delbert Grady</b></font>)</div>Grady said, leaning confidentially over the cart, <div class="bookquote">``your
son is attempting to bring an outside party into it. Your son has a very great
talent, one that the manager could use to even further improve the Overlook, to
further ... enrich it, shall we say? But your son is attempting to use that
very talent against us. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is willful, Mr. Torrance, Sir. Willful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grady/Delbert Grady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Outside party?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack asked stupidly.
Grady nodded.
<div class="bookquote">``Who?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A nigger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grady/Delbert Grady</b></font>)</div>Grady said. <div class="bookquote">``A nigger cook.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hallorann?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I believe that is his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) name, sir, yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Roger</b></font>)</div>Another burst of laughter from behind them was followed by Roger saying
something in a whining, protesting voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes! Yes! Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Derwent began to chant. The others around him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) took it up, but
before Jack could hear what they wanted Roger to do now, the band began to play
again -- the tune was <div class="bookquote">``Tuxedo Junction,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger</b></font>)</div>with a lot of mellow sax in it but not
much soul.
-LRB-Soul? Soul hasn't even been invented yet. Or has it?-RRB-
-LRB-A nigger ... a nigger cook.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) mouth to speak, not knowing what might come out. What did was:
<div class="bookquote">``I was told you hadn't finished high school. But you don't talk like an
uneducated man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's true that I left organized education very early, sir. But the manager
takes care of his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) help. He (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) finds that it pays. Education always pays, don't you
agree, sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack said dazedly.
``For instance, you show a great interest in learning more about the Overlook
Hotel. Very wise of you, sir. Very noble. A certain scrapbook was left in the

<p/>basement for you to find -- ''
``By whom?'' Jack asked eagerly.
``By the manager, of course. Certain other materials could be put at your
disposal, if you wished them ... ''
``I do. Very much.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) tried to control the eagerness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) voice and failed
miserably.
``You're a true scholar,'' Grady said. ``Pursue the topic to the end. Exhaust all
sources.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) low-browed head, pulled out the lapel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) white mess
jacket, and buffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) knuckles at a spot of dirt that was invisible to Jack.
``And the manager puts no strings on his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) largess,'' Grady went on. ``Not at all.
Look at me, a tenth-grade dropout. Think how much further you yourself could go
in the Overlook's organizational structure. Perhaps ... in time ... to the
very top.''
``Really?'' Jack whispered.
``But that's really up to your son to decide, isn't it?'' Grady asked, raising
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) eyebrows. The delicate gesture went oddly with the brows themselves, which
were bushy and somehow savage.
``Up to Danny?'' Jack frowned at Grady. ``No, of course not. I wouldn't allow my
son to make decisions concerning my career. Not at all. What do you take me for? ''
``A dedicated man,'' Grady said warmly. ``Perhaps I put it badly, sir. Let us say
that your future here is contingent upon how you decide to deal with your son's
waywardness.''
``I make my own decisions,'' Jack whispered.
``But you must deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).''
``I will.''
``Firmly ''
``I will.''
``A man who cannot control his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own family holds very little interest for our
manager. A man who cannot guide the courses of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own wife and son can hardly
be expected to guide himself, let alone assume a position of responsibility in
an operation of this magnitude. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) -- ''
``I said I'll handle him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!'' Jack shouted suddenly, enraged.
``Tuxedo Junction'' had just concluded and a new tune hadn't begun. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shout
fell perfectly into the gap, and conversation suddenly ceased behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
skin suddenly felt hot all over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) became fixedly positive that everyone was
staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). They had finished with Roger and would now commence with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).
Roll over. Sit up. Play dead. If you play the game with us, we'll play the game
with you. Position of responsibility. They wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to sacrifice his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) son.
-LRB- -- Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) follows Harry everywhere, wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) little tail behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) -- -RRB-
-LRB-Roll over. Play dead. Chastise your son.-RRB-
``Right this way, sir,'' Grady was saying. ``Something that might interest you.''
The conversation had begun again, lifting and dropping in its own rhythm,
weaving in and out of the band music, now doing a swing version of Lennon and
McCartney's <div class="bookquote">``Ticket to Ride.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-I've heard better over supermarket loudspeakers.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>McCartney</b></font>) giggled foolishly. He (<font color='blue'><b>McCartney</b></font>) looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>McCartney</b></font>) left hand and saw there was
another drink in it, half-full. He (<font color='blue'><b>McCartney</b></font>) emptied it at a gulp.
Now he (<font color='blue'><b>McCartney</b></font>) was standing in front of the mantelpiece, the heat from the crackling

<p/>fire that had been laid in the hearth warming his (<font color='blue'><b>McCartney</b></font>) legs.
-LRB-a fire? ... in August? ... yes ... and no ... all times are one-RRB-
There was a clock under a glass dome, flanked by two carved ivory elephants.
Its hands stood at a minute to midnight. He (<font color='blue'><b>McCartney</b></font>) gazed at it blearily. Had this been
what Grady wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) to see? He (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) turned around to ask, but Grady had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>).
Halfway through <div class="bookquote">``Ticket to Ride,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the band wound up in a brassy flourish.
<div class="bookquote">``The hour is at hand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Derwent/Horace Derwent</b></font>)</div>Horace Derwent proclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Midnight! Unmask! Unmask!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) tried to turn again, to see what famous faces were hidden beneath the
glitter and paint and masks, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) was frozen now, unable to look away from the
clock -- its hands had come together and pointed straight up.
<div class="bookquote">``Unmask! Unmask!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the chant went up.
The clock began to chime delicately. Along the steel runner below the
clockface, from the left and right, two figures advanced. Jack watched,
fascinated, the unmasking forgotten. Clockwork whirred. Cogs turned and meshed,
brass warmly glowing. The balance wheel rocked back and forth precisely.
One of the figures was a man standing on tiptoe, with what looked like a tiny
club clasped in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands. The other was a small boy wearing a dunce cap. The
clockwork figures glittered, fantastically precise. Across the front of the
boy's dunce cap he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could read the engraved word FOOLE.
The two figures slipped onto the opposing ends of a steel axis bar. Somewhere,
tinkling on and on, were the strains of a Strauss waltz. An insane commercial
jingle began to run through his (<font color='blue'><b>Strauss</b></font>) mind to the tune: Buy dog food, rowf-rowf, rowfrowf, buy dog food ...
The steel mallet in the clockwork daddy's hands came down on the boy's head.
The clockwork son crumpled forward. The mallet rose and fell, rose and fell. The
boy's upstretched, protesting hands began to falter. The boy sagged from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
crouch to a prone position. And still the hammer rose and fell to the light,
tinkling air of the Strauss melody, and it seemed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strauss</b></font>) could see the man's
face, working and knotting and constricting, could see the clockwork daddy's
mouth opening and closing as he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) berated the unconscious, bludgeoned figure of
the son.
A spot of red flew up against the inside of the glass dome.
Another followed. Two more splattered beside it.
Now the red liquid was spraying up like an obscene rain shower, striking the
glass sides of the dome and running, obscuring what was going on inside, and
flecked through the scarlet were tiny gray ribbons of tissue, fragments of bone
and brain. And still he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) could see the hammer rising and falling as the clockwork
continued to turn and the cogs continued to mesh the gears and teeth of this
cunningly made machine.
<div class="bookquote">``Unmask! Unmask!''  (<font color='red'><b>Derwent/Horace Derwent</b></font>)</div>Derwent was shrieking behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>), and somewhere a dog was
howling in human tones.
-LRB-But clockwork can't bleed clockwork can't bleed-RRB-
The entire dome was splashed with blood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Derwent</b></font>) could see clotted bits of hair but
nothing else thank God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could see nothing else, and still he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would
be sick because he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could hear the hammerblows still falling, could hear them
through the glass just as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could hear the phrases of <div class="bookquote">``The Blue Danube.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But
the sounds were no longer the mechanical tink-tink-tink noises of a mechanical
hammer striking a mechanical head, but the soft and squashy thudding sounds of a

<p/>real hammer slicing down and whacking into a spongy, muddy ruin. A ruin that
once had been --
<div class="bookquote">``UNMASK!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB- -- the Red Death held sway over all!-RRB-
With a miserable, rising scream, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) turned away from the clock, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands
outstretched, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) feet stumbling against one another like wooden blocks as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
begged them to stop, to take him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), Danny, Wendy, to take the whole world if they
wanted it, but only to stop and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) a little sanity, a little light.
The ballroom was empty.
The chairs with their spindly legs were upended on tables covered with plastic
dust drops. The red rug with its golden tracings was back on the dance floor,
protecting the polished hardwood surface. The bandstand was deserted except for
a disassembled microphone stand and a dusty guitar leaning stringless against
the wall. Cold morning light, winterlight, fell languidly through the high
windows.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head was still reeling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) still felt drunk, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) turned back to
the mantelpiece, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) drink was gone. There were only the ivory elephants ...
and the clock.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stumbled back across the cold, shadowy lobby and through the dining room.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) foot hooked around a table leg and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fell full-length, upsetting the table
with a clatter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) nose hard on the floor and it began to bleed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
got up, snufing back blood and wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) nose with the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
crossed to the Colorado Lounge and shoved through the batwing doors, making them
fly back and bang into the walls.
The place was empty ... but the bar was fully stocked: God be praised!
Glass and the silver edging on labels glowed warmly in the dark.
Once, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) remembered, a very long time ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been angry that there was no
backbar mirror. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was glad. Looking into it he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would have seen just another
drunk fresh off the wagon: bloody nose, untucked shirt, hair rumpled, cheeks
stubbly.
-LRB-This is what it's like to stick your whole hand into the nest.-RRB-
Loneliness surged over him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) suddenly and completely. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried out with sudden
wretchedness and honestly wished he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) were dead. His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife and son were upstairs
with the door locked against him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). The others bad all left. The party was over.
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lurched forward again, reaching the bar.
<div class="bookquote">``Lloyd, where the fuck are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) screamed.
There was no answer. In this well-padded
-LRB-cell-RRB-
room, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) words did not even echo back to give the illusion of company.
<div class="bookquote">``Grady!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No answer. Only the bottles, standing stiffly at attention.
-LRB-Roll over. Play dead. Fetch. Play dead. Sit up. Play dead.-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``Never mind, I'll do it myself, goddammit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Halfway over the bar he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) balance and pitched forward, hitting his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head
a muffled blow on the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) got up on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands and knees, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyeballs
moving disjointed from side to side, fuzzy muttering sounds coming from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
mouth. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) collapsed, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face turned to one side, breathing in harsh
snores.

<p/>Outside, the wind whooped louder, driving the thickening snow before it. It
was 8:30 A.M.

<p/><< 45 >>
STAPLETON AIRPORT,
DENVER
At 8:31 A.M., MST, a woman on TWA's Flight 196 burst into tears and began to
bugle her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own opinion, which was perhaps not unshared among some of the other
passengers -LRB-or even the crew, for that matter-RRB-, that the plane was going to
crash.
The sharp-faced woman next to Hallorann looked up from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) book and offered a
brief character analysis: <div class="bookquote">``Ninny,''  (<font color='red'><b>character</b></font>)</div>and went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) book. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had downed two
screwdrivers during the flight, but they seemed not to have thawed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at all.
<div class="bookquote">``It's going to crash!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman was crying out shrilly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I just know it
is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>A stewardess</b></font>)</div>A stewardess hurried to her (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) seat and squatted beside her (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>). Hallorann thought to
himself that only stewardesses and very young housewives seemed able to squat
with any degree of grace; it was a rare and wonderful talent. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) thought about
this while the stewardess talked softly and soothingly to the woman, quieting
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bit by bit.
Hallorann didn't know about anyone else on 196, but he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) personally was almost
scared enough to shit peachpits. Outside the window there was nothing to be seen
but a buffeting curtain of white. The plane rocked sickeningly from side to side
with gusts that seemed to come from everywhere. The engines were cranked up to
provide partial compensation and as a result the floor was vibrating under their
feet. There were several people moaning in Tourist behind them, one stew had
gone back with a handful of fresh airsick bags, and a man three rows in front of
Hallorann had whoopsed into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) National Observer and had grinned apologetically
at the stewardess who came to help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clean up. <div class="bookquote">``That's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>)
comforted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that's how I feel about the Reader's Digest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Hallorann had flown enough to be able to surmise what had happened. They had
been flying against bad headwinds most of the way, the weather over Denver had
worsened suddenly and unexpectedly, and now it was just a little late to divert
for someplace where the weather was better. Feets don't fail me now.
-LRB-Buddy-boy, this is some fucked-up cavalry charge.-RRB-
The stewardess seemed to have succeeded in curbing the worst of the woman's
hysterics. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was snuffling and honking into a lace handkerchief, but had
ceased broadcasting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) opinions about the flight's possible conclusion to the
cabin at large. The stew gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a final pat on the shoulder and stood up just
as the 747 gave its worst lurch yet. The stewardess stumbled backward and landed

<p/>in the lap of the man who had whoopsed into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paper, exposing a lovely length
of nyloned thigh. The man blinked and then patted her (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) kindly on the shoulder.
She (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) smiled back, but Hallorann thought the strain was showing. It had been one
hell of a hard flight this morning.
There was a little ping as the No SMOKING light reappeared.
<div class="bookquote">``This is the captain speaking,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a soft, slightly southern voice informed them.
<div class="bookquote">``We're ready to begin our descent to Stapleton International Airport. It's been
a rough flight, for which I apologize. The landing may be a bit rough also, but
we anticipate no real difficulty. Please observe the FASTEN SEAT BELTS and NO
SMOKING signs, and we hope you enjoy your stay in the Denver metro area. And we
also hope -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Another hard bump rocked the plane and then dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) with a sickening
elevator plunge. Hallorann's stomach did a queasy hornpipe. Several people -- not
all women by any means -- screamed.
<div class="bookquote">'' -- that we'll see you again on another TWA flight real soon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>all women</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not bloody likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>someone behind Hallorann said.
<div class="bookquote">``So silly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the sharp-faced woman next to Hallorann remarked, putting a
matchbook cover into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) book and shutting it as the plane began to descend.
<div class="bookquote">``When one has seen the horrors of a dirty little war ... as you have ... or
sensed the degrading immorality of CIA dollar-diplomacy intervention ... as I
have ... a rough landing pales into insignificance. Am I right, Mr. Hallorann? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``As rain, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) said, and looked bleakly out into the wildly blowing
snow.
<div class="bookquote">``How is your steel plate reacting to all of this, if I might inquire?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my head's fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. <div class="bookquote">``It's just my stomach that's a mite
queasy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A shame.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) reopened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) book.
As they descended through the impenetrable clouds of snow, Hallorann thought
of a crash that had occurred at Boston's Logan Airport a few years ago. The
conditions had been similar, only fog instead of snow had reduced visibility to
zero. The plane had caught its undercarriage on a retaining wall near the end of
the landing strip. What had been left of the eighty-nine people aboard hadn't
looked much different from a Hamburger Helper casserole.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Helper</b></font>) wouldn't mind so much if it was just himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Helper</b></font>) was pretty much alone in
the world now, and attendance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Helper</b></font>) funeral would be mostly held down to the
people he (<font color='blue'><b>Helper</b></font>) had worked with and that old renegade Masterton, who would at least
drink to him (<font color='blue'><b>Masterton</b></font>). But the boy ... the boy was depending on him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was maybe all
the help that child could expect, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't like the way the boy's last call
had been snapped off. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) kept thinking of the way those hedge animals had seemed
to move ...
A thin white hand appeared over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
The woman with the sharp face had taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) glasses. Without them her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
features seemed much softer.
<div class="bookquote">``It will be all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.
Hallorann made a smile and nodded.
As advertised the plane came down hard, reuniting with the earth forcefully
enough to knock most of the magazines out of the rack at the front and to send
plastic trays cascading out of the galley like oversized playing cards. No one

<p/>screamed, but Hallorann heard several sets of teeth clicking violently together
like gypsy castanets.
Then the turbine engines rose to a howl, braking the plane, and as they
dropped in volume the pilot's soft southern voice, perhaps not completely
steady, came over the intercom system. <div class="bookquote">``Ladies and gentlemen, we have landed at
Stapleton Airport. Please remain in your seats until the plane has come to a
complete stop at the terminal. Thank you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>The woman beside Hallorann closed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) book and uttered a long sigh. <div class="bookquote">``We live
to fight another day, Mr. Hallorann.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ma'am, we aren't done with this one, yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``True. Very true. Would you care to have a drink in the lounge with me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I would, but I have an appointment to keep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pressing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very pressing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said gravely.
<div class="bookquote">``Something that will improve the general situation in some small way, I hope.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hope so too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, and smiled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) smiled back at him (<font color='blue'><b>pilot</b></font>), ten years
dropping silently from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) did so.
***
Because he (<font color='blue'><b>pilot</b></font>) had only the flight bag he (<font color='blue'><b>pilot</b></font>)'d carried for luggage, Hallorann beat
the crowd to the Hertz desk on the lower level. Outside the smoked glass windows
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) could see the snow still falling steadily. The gusting wind drove white
clouds of it back and forth, and the people walking across to the parking area
were struggling against it. One man lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat and Hallorann could commiserate
with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as it whirled high, wide, and handsome. The man stared after it and
Hallorann thought:
-LRB-Aw, just forget it, man. That homburg ain't comin down until it gets to
Arizona.-RRB-
On the heels of that thought:
-LRB-If it's this bad in Denver, what's it going to be like west of Boulder?-RRB-
Best not to think about that, maybe.
<div class="bookquote">``Can I help you, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div>a girl in Hertz yellow asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``If you got a car, you can help me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) said with a big grin.
For a heavier-than-average charge he (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) was able to get a heavier-than-average
car, a silver and black Buick Electra. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) was thinking of the winding mountain
roads rather than style; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) would still have to stop somewhere along the way and
get chains put on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) wouldn't get far without them.
<div class="bookquote">``How bad is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) asked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) the rental agreement to sign.
<div class="bookquote">``They say it's the worst storm since 1969,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) answered brightly. <div class="bookquote">``Do you
have far to drive, sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Farther than I'd like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``If you'd like, sir, I can phone ahead to the Texaco station at the Route 270
junction. They'll put chains on for you.'
``That would be a great blessing, dear.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) picked up the phone and made the call. ``They'll be expecting you.''
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Leaving the desk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) saw the sharp-faced woman standing on one of the queues

<p/>that had formed in front of the luggage carousel. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was still reading her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
book. Hallorann winked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) went by. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) looked up, smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>), and
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) a peace sign.
-LRB-shine-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) turned up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) overcoat collar, smiling, and shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) flight bag to the
other hand. Only a little one, but it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) feel better. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) was sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>)'d
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) that fish story about having a steel plate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) mentally
wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) well and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) went out into the howling wind and snow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Hertz</b></font>) the same in return
***
The charge for putting on the chains at the service station was a modest one,
but Hallorann slipped the man at work in the garage bay an extra ten to get
moved up a little way on the waiting list. It was still quarter of ten before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was actually on the road, the windshield wipers clicking and the chains clinking
with tuneless monotony on the Buick's big wheels.
The turnpike was a mess. Even with the chains he (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>) could go no faster than
thirty. Cars had gone off the road at crazy angles, and on several of the grades
traffic was barely struggling along, summer tires spinning helplessly in the
drifting powder. It was the first big storm of the winter down here in the
lowlands -LRB-if you could call a mile above sealevel <div class="bookquote">``low'' (<font color='red'><b>a mother</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, and it was a mother.
Many of them were unprepared, common enough, but Hallorann still found himself
cursing them as he (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>) inched around them, peering into his (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>) snow-clogged outside
mirror to be sure nothing was
-LRB-Dashing through the snow ...-RRB-
coming up in the left-hand lane to cream his (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>) black ass.
There was more bad luck waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>) at the Route 36 entrance ramp. Route
36, the Denver-Boulder turnpike, also goes west to Estes Park, where it connects
with Route 7. That road, also known as the Upland Highway, goes through
Sidewinder, passes the Overlook Hotel, and finally winds down the Western Slope
and into Utah.
The entrance ramp had been blocked by an overturned semi. Bright-burning
flares had been scattered around it like birthday candles on some idiot child's
cake.
He (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) came to a stop and rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) window down. A cop with a fur Cossack hat
jammed down over his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) ears gestured with one gloved hand toward the flow of
traffic moving north on I-25.
<div class="bookquote">``You can't get up here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) bawled to Hallorann over the wind. <div class="bookquote">``Go down two
exits, get on 91, and connect with 36 at Broomfield!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think I could get around him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) on the left!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann shouted back. <div class="bookquote">``That's
twenty miles out of my way, what you're rappin!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll rap your friggin head!''  (<font color='red'><b>the cop</b></font>)</div>the cop shouted back. <div class="bookquote">``This ramp's closed!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann backed up, waited for a break in traffic, and continued on his (<font color='blue'><b>cop</b></font>) way
up Route 25. The signs informed him (<font color='blue'><b>cop</b></font>) it was only a hundred miles to Cheyenne,
Wyoming. If he (<font color='blue'><b>cop</b></font>) didn't look out for his (<font color='blue'><b>cop</b></font>) ramp, he (<font color='blue'><b>cop</b></font>)'d wind up there.
He (<font color='blue'><b>cop</b></font>) inched his (<font color='blue'><b>cop</b></font>) speed up to thirty-five but dared no more; already snow was
threatening to clog his (<font color='blue'><b>cop</b></font>) wiper blades and the traffic patterns were decidedly

<p/>crazy. Twenty-mile detour. He (<font color='blue'><b>cop</b></font>) cursed, and the feeling that time was growing
shorter for the boy welled up in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) again, nearly suffocating with its urgency.
And at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) felt a fatalistic certainty that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would not be coming
back from this trip.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turned on the radio, dialed past Christmas ads, and found a weather
forecast.
<div class="bookquote">'' -- six inches already, and another foot is expected in the Denver metro area
by nightfall. Local and state police urge you not to take your car out of the

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thanks, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, and turned the radio off savagely.

WENDY
Around noon, after Danny had gone into the bathroom to use the toilet, Wendy
took the towel-wrapped knife from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) pillow, put it in the pocket of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
bathrobe, and went over to the bathroom door.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm going down to make us some lunch. `Kay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay. Do you want me to come down?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I'll bring it up. How about a cheese omelet and some soup?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hesitated outside the closed door a moment longer, <div class="bookquote">``Danny, are you sure
it's okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Just be careful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where's your father? Do you know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) voice came back, curiously flat: <div class="bookquote">``No. But it's okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stifled an urge
to keep asking, to keep picking around the edges of the thing. The thing was
there, they knew what it was, picking at it was only going to frighten Danny
more ... and herself. Jack had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mind. They had sat together on Danny's
cot as the storm began to pick up clout and meanness around eight o'clock this
morning and had listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) downstairs, bellowing and stumbling from one
place to another. Most of it had seemed to come from the ballroom. Jack singing
tuneless bits of song, Jack holding up one side of an argument, Jack screaming
loudly at one point, freezing both of their faces as they stared into one
another's eyes. Finally they had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stumbling back across the lobby, and
Wendy thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had heard a loud banging noise, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had fallen down or
pushed a door violently open. Since eightthirty or so -- three and a half hours
now -- there had been only silence.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) went down the short hall, turned into the main first floor corridor, and
went to the stairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stood on the firstfloor landing looking down into the
lobby. It appeared deserted, but the gray and snowy day had left much of the
long room in shadow. Danny could be wrong. Jack could be behind a chair or couch
... maybe behind the registration desk ... waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) to come down...
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wet her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``Jack?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No answer.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand found the handle of the knife and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) began to go down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had seen
the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) marriage many times, in divorce, in Jack's death at the scene of
a drunken car accident -LRB-a regular vision in the dark two o'clock of Stovington
mornings-RRB-, and occasionally in daydreams of being discovered by another man, a
soap opera Galahad who would sweep Danny and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) onto the saddle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) snowwhite charger and take them away. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had never envisioned herself prowling
halls and staircases like a nervous felon, with a knife clasped in one hand to
use against Jack.
A wave of despair struck through her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) at the thought and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had to stop
halfway down the stairs and hold the railing, afraid her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knees would buckle.
-LRB-Admit it. It isn't just Jack, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s just the one solid thing in all of this
you can hang the other things on, the things you can't believe and yet are being
forced to believe, that thing about the hedges, the party favor in the elevator,
the mask-RRB-
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) tried to stop the thought but it was too late.
-LRB-and the voices.-RRB-
Because from time to time it had not seemed that there was a solitary crazy
man below them, shouting at and holding conversations with the phantoms in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own crumbling mind. From time to time, like a radio signal fading in and out,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had heard -- or thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had -- other voices, and music, and laughter. At one
moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would hear Jack holding a conversation with someone named Grady -LRB-the
name was vaguely familiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) made no actual connection-RRB-, making
statements and asking questions into silence, yet speaking loudly, as if to make
himself heard over a steady background racket. And then, eerily, other sounds
would be there, seeming to slip into places -- a dance band, people clapping, a man
with an amused yet authoritative voice who seemed to be trying to persuade
somebody to make a speech. For a period of thirty seconds to a minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would
hear this, long enough to grow faint with terror, and then it would be gone
again and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would only hear Jack, talking in that commanding yet slightly
slurred way she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) remembered as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) drunk-speak voice. But there was nothing in
the hotel to drink except cooking sherry. Wasn't that right? Yes, but if she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
could imagine that the hotel was full of voices and music, couldn't Jack imagine
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was drunk?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) didn't like that thought. Not at all.
Wendy reached the lobby and looked around. The velvet rope that had cordoned
off the ballroom had been taken down; the steel post it had been clipped to had
been knocked over, as if someone had carelessly bumped it going by. Mellow white
light fell through the open door onto the lobby rug from the ballroom's high,
narrow windows. Heart thumping, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) went to the open ballroom doors and looked
in. It was empty and silent, the only sound that curious subaural echo that
seems to linger in all large rooms, from the largest cathedral to the smallest

<p/>hometown bingo parlor.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) went back to the registration desk and stood undecided for a moment,
listening to the wind howl outside. It was the worst storm so far, and it was
still building up force. Somewhere on the west side a shutter latch had broken
and the shutter banged back and forth with a steady flat cracking sound, like a
shooting gallery with only one customer.
-LRB-Jack, you really should take care of that. Before something gets in.-RRB-
What would she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) do if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) came at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) right now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wondered. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) should pop
up from behind the dark, varnished registration desk with its pile of triplicate
forms and its little silver-plated bell, like some murderous jack-in-the-box,
pun intended, a grinning jack-in-the-box with a cleaver in one hand and no sense
at all left behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stand frozen with terror, or was there
enough of the primal mother in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) to fight him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) son until one of them
was dead? She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) didn't know. The very thought made her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sick -- made her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) feel that her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
whole life had been a long and easy dream to lull her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) helplessly into this
waking nightmare. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was soft. When trouble came, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) slept. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) past was
unremarkable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had never been tried in fire. Now the trial was upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), not
fire but ice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would not be allowed to sleep through this. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) son was
waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) upstairs.
Clutching the haft of the knife tighter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) peered over the desk.
Nothing there.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) relieved breath escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) in a long, hitching sigh.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) put the gate up and went through, pausing to glance into the inner office
before going in herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fumbled through the next door for the bank of
kitchen light switches, coldly expecting a hand to close over hers at any
second. Then the fluorescents were coming on with minuscule ticking and humming
sounds and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could see Mr. Hallorann's kitchen -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) kitchen now, for better or
worse -- pale green tiles, gleaming Formica, spotless porcelain, glowing chrome
edgings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) kitchen clean, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
felt as if it was one of Danny's safe places. Dick Hallorann's presence seemed
to enfold and comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). Danny had called for Mr. Hallorann, and upstairs,
sitting next to Danny in fear as her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) husband ranted and raved below, that had
seemed like the faintest of all hopes. But standing here, in Mr. Hallorann's
place, it seemed almost possible. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) way now, intent on
getting to them regardless of the storm. Perhaps it was so.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) went across to the pantry, shot the bolt back, and stepped inside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) got
a can of tomato soup and closed the pantry door again, and bolted it. The door
was tight against the floor. If you kept it bolted, you didn't have to worry
about rat or mouse droppings in the rice or flour or sugar.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) opened the can and dropped the slightly jellied contents into a saucepan --
plop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) went to the refrigerator and got milk and eggs for the omelet. Then to
the walk-in freezer for cheese. All of these actions, so common and so much a
part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) life before the Overlook had been a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) life, helped to calm
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) melted butter in the frying pan, diluted the soup with milk, and then
poured the beaten eggs into the pan.
A sudden feeling that someone was standing behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), reaching for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
throat.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wheeled around, clutching the knife. No one there.
-LRB-! Get ahold of yourself, girl!-RRB-
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grated a bowl of cheese from the block, added it to the omelet, flipped
it, and turned the gas ring down to a bare blue flame. The soup was hot. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) put
the pot on a large tray with silverware, two bowls, two plates, the salt and
pepper shakers. When the omelet had puffed slightly, Wendy slid it off onto one
of the plates and covered it.
-LRB-Now back the way you came. Turn off the kitchen lights. Go through the inner
office. Through the desk gate, collect two hundred dollars.-RRB-
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stopped on the lobby side of the registration desk and set the tray down
beside the silver bell. Unreality would stretch only so far; this was like some
surreal game of hide-and-seek.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stood in the shadowy lobby, frowning in thought.
-LRB-Don't push the facts away this time, girl. There are certain realities, as
lunatic as this situation may seem. One of them is that you may be the only
responsible person left in this grotesque pile. You have a five-going-on-six son
to look out for. And your husband, whatever has happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and no matter
how dangerous he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) may be ... maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s part of your responsibility, too. And
even if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) isn't consider this: Today is December second. You could be stuck up
here another four months if a ranger doesn't happen by. Even if they do start to
wonder why they haven't heard from us on the CB, no one is going to come today ...
or tomorrow ... maybe not for weeks. Are you going to spend a month
sneaking down to get meals with a knife in your pocket and jumping at every
shadow? Do you really think you can avoid Jack for a month? Do you think you can
keep Jack out of the upstairs quarters if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wants to get in? He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) has the passkey
and one hard kick would snap the bolt.-RRB-
Leaving the tray on the desk, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) walked slowly down to the dining room and
looked in. It was deserted. There was one table with the chairs set up around
it, the table they had tried eating at until the dining room's emptiness began
to freak them out.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) called hesitantly.
At that moment the wind rose in a gust, driving snow against the shutters, but
it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) that there had been something. A muffled sort of groan.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colorado Lounge</b></font>)</div>No returning sound this time, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes fell on something beneath the
batwing doors of the Colorado Lounge, something that gleamed faintly in the
subdued light. Jack's cigarette lighter.
Plucking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) courage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) crossed to the batwings and pushed them open. The
smell of gin was so strong that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) breath snagged in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) throat. It wasn't even
right to call it a smell; it was a positive reek. But the shelves were empty.
Where in God's name had he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) found it? A bottle hidden at the back of one of the
cupboards? Where?
There was another groan, low and fuzzy, but perfectly audible this time. Wendy
walked slowly to the bar.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No answer.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked over the bar and there he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was, sprawled out on the floor in a
stupor. Drunk as a lord, by the smell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) must have tried to go right over the

<p/>top and lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) balance. A wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) hadn't broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) neck. An old proverb
recurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>): God looks after drunks and little children. Amen.
Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was not angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); looking down at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought be looked like
a horribly overtired little boy who had tried to do too much and had fallen
asleep in the middle of the living room floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had stopped drinking and it
was not Jack who had made the decision to start again; there had been no liquor
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to start with ... so where had it come from?
Resting at every five or six feet along the horseshoe-shaped bar there were
wine bottles wrapped in straw, their mouths plugged with candles. Supposed to
look bohemian, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) supposed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) picked one up and shook it, half-expecting to
hear the slosh of gin inside it
-LRB-new wine in old bottles-RRB-
but there was nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) set it back down.
Jack was stirring. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) went around the bar, found the gate, and walked back on
the inside to where Jack lay, pausing only to look at the gleaming chromium
taps. They were dry, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) passed close to them she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could smell beer, wet
and new, like a fine mist.
As she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) reached Jack he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) rolled over, opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes, and looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). For
a moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) gaze was utterly blank, and then it cleared.
<div class="bookquote">``Wendy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``That you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think you can make it upstairs? If you put your arms
around me? Jack, where did you -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hand closed brutally around her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ankle.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack! What are you -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Gotcha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, and began to grin. There was a stale odor of gin and olives
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) that seemed to set off an old terror in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), a worse terror than any
hotel could provide by itself. A distant part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought that the worst
thing was that it had all come back to this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) drunken husband.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack, I want to help.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh yeah. You and Danny only want to help.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The grip on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ankle was crushing
now. Still holding onto her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), Jack was getting shakily to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knees. <div class="bookquote">``You wanted
to help us all right out of here. But now ... I ... gotcha!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jack, you're hurting my ankle -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll hurt more than your ankle, you bitch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>The word stunned her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) so completely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) made no effort to move when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) let
go of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ankle and stumbled from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knees to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) feet, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stood swaying
in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``You never loved me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You want us to leave because you know that'll
be the end of me. Did you ever think about my re ... res ...
respons`bilities? No, I guess to fuck you didn't. All you ever think about is
ways to drag me down. You're just like my mother, you milksop bitch!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stop it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, crying. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know what you're saying. You're drunk.
I don't know how, but you're drunk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know. I know now. You and him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). That little pup upstairs. The two of
you, planning together. Isn't that right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no! We never planned anything! What are you -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You liar!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) screamed. ``Oh, I know how you do it! I guess I know that! When
I say, `We're going to stay here and I'm going to do my job,' you say, `Yes,

<p/>dear,' and he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) says, `Yes, Daddy,' and then you lay your plans. You planned to
use the snowmobile. You planned that. But I knew. I figured it out. Did you
think I wouldn't figure it out? Did you think I was stupid?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), unable to speak now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was going to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
was going to kill Danny. Then maybe the hotel would be satisfied and allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
to kill himself. Just like that other caretaker. Just like
-LRB-Grady.-RRB-
With almost swooning horror, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) realized at last who it was that Jack had
been conversing with in the ballroom.
``You turned my son against me. That was the worst.'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face sagged into lines
of selfpity. ``My little boy. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hates me, too. You saw to that. That was
your plan all along, wasn't it? You've always been jealous, haven't you? Just
like your mother. You couldn't be satisfied unless you had all the cake, could
you? Could you?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) couldn't talk.
``Well, I'll fix you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, and tried to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands around her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) throat.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) took a step backward, then another, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stumbled against her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
remembered the knife in the pocket of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) robe and groped for it, but now his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
left arm had swept around her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), pinning her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arm against her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could smell
sharp gin and the sour odor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) sweat.
``Have to be punished,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was grunting. ``Chastised. Chastised ... harshly.''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) right hand found her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) throat.
As her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breath stopped, pure panic took over. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) left hand joined his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) right
and now the knife was free to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) own hand, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) forgot about it. Both of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
hands came up and began to yank helplessly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) larger, stronger ones.
``Mommy!'' Danny shrieked from somewhere. ``Daddy, stop! You're hurting Mommyl''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) screamed piercingly, a high and crystal sound that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) heard from far off.
Red flashes of light leaped in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) eyes like ballet dancers. The room
grew darker. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) son clamber up on the bar and throw himself at Jack's
shoulders. Suddenly one of the hands that had been crushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) throat was gone
as Jack cuffed Danny away with a snarl. The boy fell back against the empty
shelves and dropped to the floor, dazed. The hand was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) throat again. The
red flashes began to turn black.
Danny was crying weakly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) chest was burning. Jack was shouting into her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
face: <div class="bookquote">``I'll fix you! Goddam you, I'll show you who is boss around here! I'll
show you -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But all sounds were fading down a long dark corridor. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) struggles began to
weaken. One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hands fell away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and dropped slowly until the arm was
stretched out at right angles to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) body, the hand dangling limply from the
wrist like the hand of a drowning woman.
It touched a bottle -- one of the straw-wrapped wine bottles that served as
decorative candleholders.
Sightlessly, with the last of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) strength, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) groped for the bottle's neck
and found it, feeling the greasy beads of wax against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand.
-LRB-and U God if it slips-RRB-
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brought it up and then down, praying for aim, knowing that if it only
struck his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shoulder or upper arm she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dead.
But the bottle came down squarely on Jack Torrance's head, the glass

<p/>shattering violently inside the straw. The base of it was thick and heavy, and
it made a sound against his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) skull like a medicine ball dropped on a hardwood
floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) rocked back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) heels, his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) eyes rolling up in their sockets. The
pressure on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) throat loosened, then gave way entirely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) hands out,
as if to steady himself, and then crashed over on his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) back.
Wendy drew a long, sobbing breath. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) almost fell herself, clutched the edge
of the bar, and managed to hold herself up. Consciousness wavered in and out.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could hear Danny crying, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had no idea where he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was. It sounded like
crying in an echo chamber. Dimly she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw dime-sized drops of blood falling to
the dark surface of the bar-from her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) nose, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cleared her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) throat
and spat on the floor. It sent a wave of agony up the column of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) throat, but
the agony subsided to a steady dull press of pain... just bearable.
Little by little, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) managed to get control of herself.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) let go of the bar, turned around, and saw Jack lying full-length, the
shattered bottle beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) looked like a felled giant. Danny was crouched
below the lounge's cash register, both hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth, staring at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
unconscious father.
Wendy went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) unsteadily and touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shoulder. Danny cringed away from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Danny, listen to me -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) muttered in a husky old man's voice. <div class="bookquote">``Daddy hurt you ... you

to sleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Danny -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sleep, sleep. Nighty-night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Pain ripping up her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) throat again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) winced against it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
eyes. They looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) warily from bluish, shadowed sockets.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) made herself speak calmly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) eyes never leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) voice was low
and husky, almost a whisper. It hurt to talk. <div class="bookquote">``Listen to me, Danny. It wasn't
your daddy trying to hurt me. And I didn't want to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). The hotel has
gotten into him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), Danny. The Overlook has gotten into your daddy. Do you
understand me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Some kind of knowledge came slowly back into Danny's eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``The Bad Stuff,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``There was none of it here before, was there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``No. The hotel put it here. The ... ' She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) broke off in a fit of coughing and
spat out more blood. Her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) throat already felt puffed to twice its size. ``The
hotel made him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) drink it. Did you hear those people he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was talking to this
morning?''
``Yes ... the hotel people...''
``I heard them too. And that means the hotel is getting stronger. It wants to
hurt all of us. But I think ... I hope ... that it can only do that through
your daddy. He (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) was the only one it could catch. Are you understanding me, Danny?
It's desperately important that you understand.''
``The hotel caught Daddy.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked at Jack and groaned helplessly.
<div class="bookquote">``I know you love your daddy. I do too. We have to remember that the hotel is
trying to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) as much as it is us.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was convinced that was true.
More, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought that Danny might be the one the hotel really wanted, the

<p/>reason it was going so far ... maybe the reason it was able to go so far. It
might even be that in some unknown fashion it was Danny's shine that was
powering it, the way a battery powers the electrical equipment in a car ...
the way a battery gets a car to start. If they got out of here, the Overlook
might subside to its old semi-sentient state, able to do no more than present
penny-dreadful horror slides to the more psychically aware guests who entered
it. Without Danny it was not much more than an amusement park haunted house,
where a guest or two might hear rappings or the phantom sounds of a masquerade
party, or see an occasional disturbing thing. But if it absorbed Danny ...
Danny's shine or lifeforce or spirit ... whatever you wanted to call it ...
into itself -- what would it be then?
The thought made her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cold all over.
<div class="bookquote">``I wish Daddy was all better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said, and the tears began to flow again.
<div class="bookquote">``Me too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, and hugged Danny tightly. <div class="bookquote">``And honey, that's why you've
got to help me put your daddy somewhere. Somewhere that the hotel can't make him (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>)
hurt us and where he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) can't hurt himself. Then ... if your friend Dick comes,
or a park ranger, we can take him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) away. And I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) might be all right again.
All of us might be all right. I think there's still a chance for that, if we're
strong and brave, like you were when you jumped on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) back. Do you understand?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pleadingly and thought how strange it was; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had never seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked so much like Jack.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, and nodded. <div class="bookquote">``I think ... if we can get away from here ...
everything will be like it was. Where could we put him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The pantry. There's food in there, and a good strong bolt on the outside.
It's warm. And we can eat up the things from the refrigerator and the freezer.
There will be plenty for all three of us until help comes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do we do it now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, right now. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) wakes up.,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny put the bargate up while she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) folded Jack's hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) chest and
listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) breathing for a moment. It was slow but regular. From the smell
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) must have drunk a great deal ... and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was out of the
habit. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thought it might be liquor as much as the crack on the head with the
bottle that had put him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) out.
She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) legs and began to drag him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) along the floor. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had been
married to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) for nearly seven years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had lain on top of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) countless
times -- in the thousands -- but she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had never realized how heavy he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was. Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) breath
whistled painfully in and out of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hurt throat. Nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) felt better
than she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had in days. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was alive. Having just brushed so close to death, that
was precious. And Jack was alive, too. By blind luck rather than plan, they had
perhaps found the only way that would bring them all safely out.
Panting harshly, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) paused a moment, holding Jack's feet against her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hips.
The surroundings reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) of the old seafaring captain's cry in Treasure
Island after old blind Pew had passed him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) the Black Spot: he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'ll do em yet.
And then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) remembered, uncomfortably, that the old seadog had dropped dead
mere seconds later.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you all right, Mommy? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>).. . is he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) too heavy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll manage.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) began to drag him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) again. Danny was beside Jack. One of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
hands had fallen off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) chest, and Danny replaced it gently, with love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure, Mommy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. It's the best thing, Danny.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's like putting him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) in jail.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only for awhile.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay, then. Are you sure you can do it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But it was a near thing, at that. Danny had been cradling his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father's head
when they went over the doorsills, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands slipped in Jack's greasy hair
as they went into the kitchen. The back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head struck the tiles, and Jack
began to moan and stir.
<div class="bookquote">``You got to use smoke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack muttered quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Now run and get me that
gascan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy and Danny exchanged tight, fearful glances.
<div class="bookquote">``Help me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said in a low voice.
For a moment Danny stood as if paralyzed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father's face, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
moved jerkily to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) side and helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hold the left leg. They dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
across the kitchen floor in a nightmare kind of slow motion, the only sounds the
faint, insectile buzz of the fluorescent lights and their own labored breathing.
When they reached the pantry, Wendy put Jack's feet down and turned to fumble
with the bolt. Danny looked down at Jack, who was lying limp and relaxed again.
The shirttail had pulled out of the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pants as they dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and
Danny wondered if Daddy was too drunk to be cold. It seemed wrong to lock him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) in
the pantry like a wild animal, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had seen what he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tried to do to Mommy.
Even upstairs he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had known Daddy was going to do that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) had heard them arguing
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) head.
-LRB-If only we could all be out of here. Or if it was a dream I was having, back
in Stovington. If only.-RRB-
The bolt was stuck.
Wendy pulled at it as hard as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could, but it wouldn't move. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) couldn't
retract the goddam bolt. It was stupid and unfair ... she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had opened it with
no trouble at all when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had gone in to get the can of soup. Now it wouldn't
move, and what was she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) going to do? They couldn't put him (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) in the walk-in
refrigerator; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would freeze or smother to death. But if they left him (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) out and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) woke up ...
Jack stirred again on the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll take care of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``I understand''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s waking up, Mommy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny warned.
Sobbing now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) yanked at the bolt with both hands.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>There was something softly menacing, if still blurry, in Jack's
voice. <div class="bookquote">``That you, ole doc?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just go to sleep, Daddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said nervously. <div class="bookquote">``It's bedtime, you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked up at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother, still struggling with the bolt, and saw what was
wrong immediately. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had forgotten to rotate the bolt before trying to
withdraw it. The little catch was stuck in its notch.
<div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said low, and brushed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) trembling hands aside; his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) own were
shaking almost as badly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knocked the catch loose with the heel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand
and the bolt drew back easily.
<div class="bookquote">``Quick,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked down. Jack's eyes bad fluttered open again and

<p/>this time Daddy was looking directly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) gaze strangely flat and
speculative.
<div class="bookquote">``You copied it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daddy</b></font>)</div>Daddy told him (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I know you did, But it's here somewhere. And
I'll find it. That I promise you. I'll find it...''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) words slurred off again.
Wendy pushed the pantry door open with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knee, hardly noticing the pungent
odor of dried fruit that wafted out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) picked up Jack's feet again and dragged
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was gasping harshly now, at the limit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) strength. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) yanked
the chain pull that turned on the light, Jack's eyes fluttered open again.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you doing? Wendy? What are you doing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stepped over him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was quick; amazingly quick. One hand lashed out and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had to sidestep and
nearly fall out the door to avoid his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) grasp. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had caught a handful of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) bathrobe and there was a heavy purring noise as it ripped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
hands and knees now, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hair hanging in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes, like some heavy animal. A
large dog ... or a lion.
<div class="bookquote">``Damn you both, I know what you want. But you're not going to get it. This

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The door, Danny!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) screamed. <div class="bookquote">``Shut the door!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pushed the heavy wooden door shut with a slam, just as Jack leaped. The
door latched and Jack thudded uselessly against it.
Danny's small hands groped at the bolt. Wendy was too far away to help; the
issue of whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would be locked in or free was going to be decided in two
seconds. Danny missed his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) grip, found it again, and shot the bolt across just as
the latch began to jiggle madly up and down below it. Then it stayed up and
there was a series of thuds as Jack slammed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shoulder against the door. The
bolt, a quarter inch of steel in diameter, showed no signs of loosening. Wendy
let her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breath out slowly.
<div class="bookquote">``Let me out of here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack raged. <div class="bookquote">``Let me out! Danny, doggone it, this is your
father and I want to get out! Now do what I tell you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny's hand moved automatically toward the bolt. Wendy caught it and pressed
it between her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breasts.
<div class="bookquote">``You mind your daddy, Danny! You do what I say! You do it or I'll give you a
hiding you'll never forget. Open this door or I'll bash your fucking brains in!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), pale as window glass.
They could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) breath tearing in and out behind the half inch of solid
oak.
<div class="bookquote">``Wendy, you let me out! Let me out right now! You cheap pickle-plated coldcunt bitch! You let me out! I mean it! Let me out of here and I'll let it go! If

would pass you on the street! Now open this door!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny moaned. Wendy looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was going to faint in a moment.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on, doc,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, surprised at the calmness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) own voices <div class="bookquote">``It's

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come hack here and let me out right NOW!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack screamed. There was a
scraping, breaking sound as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) attacked the inside of the door with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
fingernails.
<div class="bookquote">``It's the hotel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. <div class="bookquote">``It's the hotel. I remember.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked back
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shoulder and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face was crumpled and terrified.

DANNY
It was three in the afternoon of a long, long day.
They were sitting on the big bed in their quarters. Danny was turning the
purple VW model with the monster sticking out of the sun roof over and over in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands, compulsively.
They had heard Daddy's batterings at the door all the way across the lobby,
the batterings and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) voice, hoarse and petulantly angry in a weak-king sort of
a way, vomiting promises of punishment, vomiting profanity, promising both of
them that they would live to regret betraying him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) after he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had slaved his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) guts
out for them over the years.
Danny thought they would no longer be able to hear it upstairs, but the sounds
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) rage carried perfectly up the dumb-waiter shaft: Mommy's face was pale,
and there were horrible brownish bruises on her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) neck where Daddy had tried to...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) turned the model over and over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands, Daddy's prize for having
learned his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) reading lessons.
-LRB-... where Daddy had tried to hug her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) too tight.-RRB-
Mommy put some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) music on the little record player, scratchy and full of
horns and flutes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) tiredly. He (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) tried to smile back and failed.
Even with the volume turned up loud he (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) could still hear Daddy
screaming at them and battering the pantry door like an animal in a zoo cage:
What if Daddy had to go to the bathroom? What would he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) do then?
Danny began to cry.
Wendy turned the volume down on the record player at once, held him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), rocked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lap.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny, love, it will be all right. It will. If Mr. Hallorann didn't get your
message, someone else will. As soon as the storm is over. No one could get up
here until then anyway. Mr. Hallorann or anyone else. But when the storm is
over, everything will be fine again. We'll leave here. And do you know what
we'll do next spring? The three of us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head against her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breasts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't know. It seemed there
could never be spring again.
<div class="bookquote">``We'll go fishing. We'll rent a boat and go fishing, just like we did last
year on Chatterton Lake. You and me and your daddy. And maybe you'll catch a
bass for our supper. And maybe we won't catch anything, but we're sure to have a
good time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I love you, Mommy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said, and hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Danny, I love you, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Outside, the wind whooped and screamed,

<p/>***
Around four-thirty, just as the daylight began to fail, the screams ceased.
They had both been dozing uneasily, Wendy still holding Danny in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arms, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) didn't wake. But Danny did. Somehow the silence was worse, more ominous than
the screams and the blows against the strong pantry door. Was Daddy asleep
again? Or dead? Or what?
-LRB-Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) get out?-RRB-
Fifteen minutes later the silence was broken by a hard, grating, metallic
rattle. There was a heavy grinding, then a mechanical humming. Wendy came awake
with a cry.
The elevator was running again.
They listened to it, wide-eyed, hugging each other. It went from floor to
floor, the grate rattling back, the brass door slamming open. There was
laughter, drunken shouts, occasional screams, and the sounds of breakage.
The Overlook was coming to life around them.

<p/><< 48 >>
JACK
He (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) sat on the floor of the pantry with his (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) legs out in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>), a box of
Triscuit crackers between them, looking at the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) was eating the crackers
one by one, not tasting them, only eating them because he (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) had to eat something.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) got out of here, he (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) was going to need his (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) strength. All of it.
At this precise instant, he (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) had never felt quite so miserable in
his (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) entire life. His (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) mind and body together made up a large-writ scripture of
pain. His (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) head ached terribly, the sick throb of a hangover. The attendant
symptoms were there, too: his (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) mouth tasted like a manure rake had taken a swing
through it, his (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) ears rung, his (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) heart had an extra-heavy, thudding beat, like a
tom-tom. In addition, both shoulders ached fiercely from throwing himself
against the door and his (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) throat felt raw and peeled from useless shouting. He (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>)
had cut his (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) right hand on the doorlatch.
And when he (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) got out of here, he (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) was going to kick some ass.
He (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) munched the Triscuits one by one, refusing to give in to his (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) wretched
stomach, which wanted to vomit up everything. He (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) thought of the Excedrins in his (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>)
pocket and decided to wait until his (<font color='blue'><b>JACK</b></font>) stomach had quieted a bit. No sense
swallowing a painkiller if you were going to throw it right back up. Have to use
your brain. The celebrated Jack Torrance brain. Aren't you the fellow who once
was going to live by his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) wits? Jack Torrance, best-selling author. Jack
Torrance, acclaimed playwright and winner of the New York Critics Circle Award.

<p/>John Torrance, man of letters, esteemed thinker, winner of the Pulitzer Prize at
seventy for his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) trenchant book of memoirs, My Life in the Twentieth Century. All
any of that shit boiled down to was living by your wits.
Living by your wits is always knowing where the wasps are.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) put another Triscuit into his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) mouth and crunched it up.
What it really came down to, he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) supposed, was their lack of trust in him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>).
Their failure to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) knew what was best for them and how to get it.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) wife had tried to usurp him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>), first by fair
-LRB-sort of-RRB-
means, then by foul. When her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) little hints and whining objections had been
overturned by his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) own well-reasoned arguments, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) boy against
him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>), tried to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) with a bottle, and then had locked him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>), of all places, in
the goddamned fucking pantry.
Still, a small interior voice nagged him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>).
-LRB-Yes but where did the liquor come from? Isn't that really the central point?
You know what happens when you drink, you know it from bitter experience. When
you drink, you lose your wits.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) hurled the box of Triscuits across the small room. They struck a shelf of
canned goods and fell to the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) looked at the box, wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) lips with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) hand, and then looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) watch. It was almost six-thirty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had been in
here for hours. His (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) wife had locked him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) in here and he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>)'d been here for fucking
hours.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) could begin to sympathize with his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) father
The thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>)'d never asked himself, Jack realized now, was exactly what had
driven his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) daddy to drink in the first place. And really ... when you came
right down to what his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) old students had been pleased to call the nifty-gritty ...
hadn't it been the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was married to? A milksop sponge of a woman,
always dragging silently around the house with an expression of doomed martyrdom
on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face? A ball and chain around Daddy's ankle? No, not ball and chain. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had never actively tried to make Daddy a prisoner, the way Wendy had done to
him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>). For Jack's father it must have been more like the fate of McTeague the
dentist at the end of Frank Norris's great novel: handcuffed to a dead man in
the wasteland. Yes, that was better. Mentally and spiritually dead, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother
had been handcuffed to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father by matrimony. Still, Daddy had tried to do
right as he (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rotting corpse through life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) had tried to bring the
four children up to know right from wrong, to understand discipline, and above
all, to respect their father.
Well, they had been ingrates, all of them, himself included. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
paying the price; his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own son had turned out to be an ingrate, too. But there
was hope. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would get out of here somehow. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would chastise them both, and
harshly. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would set Danny an example, so that the day might come when Danny
was grown, a day when Danny would know what to do better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) himself had
known.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) remembered the Sunday dinner when his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father had caned his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother at the
table ... how horrified he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and the others had been. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could see how
necessary that bad been, how his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father had only been feigning drunkenness, how
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wits had been sharp and alive underneath all along, watching for the
slightest sign of disrespect.

<p/>Jack crawled after the Triscuits and began to eat them again, sitting by the
door she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had so treacherously bolted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wondered exactly what his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) father had
seen, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had caught her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) out by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) playacting. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) been sneering at
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand? Sticking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tongue out? Making obscene finger gestures? Or
only looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) insolently and arrogantly, convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was too
stupidly drunk to see? Whatever it had been, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had caught her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
chastised her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sharply. And now, twenty years later, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could finally appreciate
Daddy's wisdom.
Of course you could say Daddy had been foolish to marry such a woman, to have
handcuffed himself to that corpse in the first place ... and a disrespectful
corpse at that. But when the young marry in haste they must repent in leisure,
and perhaps Daddy's daddy had married the same type of woman, so that
unconsciously Jack's daddy had also married one, as Jack himself had. Except
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wife, instead of being satisfied with the passive role of having
wrecked one career and crippled another, had opted for the poisonously active
task of trying to destroy his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) last and best chance: to become a member of the
Overlook's staff, and possibly to rise ... all the way to the position of
manager, in time. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was trying to deny him (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) Danny, and Danny was his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ticket of
admission. That was foolish, of course -- why would they want the son when they
could have the father? -- but employers often had foolish ideas and that was the
condition that had been made.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wasn't going to be able to reason with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could see that now. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
tried to reason with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in the Colorado Lounge, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had refused to listen,
had hit him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) over the head with a bottle for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pains. But there would be
another time, and soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would get out of here.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) suddenly held his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) breath and cocked his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head. Somewhere a piano was playing
boogie-woogie and people were laughing and clapping along. The sound was muffled
through the heavy wooden door, but audible. The song was <div class="bookquote">``There'll Be a Hot Time
in the Old Town Tonight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands curled helplessly into fists; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had to restrain himself from
battering at the door with them. The party had begun again. The liquor would be
flowing freely. Somewhere, dancing with someone else, would be the girl who had
felt so maddeningly nude under her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) white silk gown.
<div class="bookquote">``You'll pay for this!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) howled. <div class="bookquote">``Goddam you two, you'll pay! You'll take
your goddam medicine for this, I promise you! You -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Here, here, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a mild voice said just outside the door, <div class="bookquote">``No need to shout,
old fellow. I can hear you perfectly well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack lurched to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) feet
<div class="bookquote">``Grady? Is that you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. Indeed it is. You appear to have been locked in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let me out, Grady. Quickly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I see you can hardly have taken care of the business we discussed, sir. The
correction of your wife and son.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They're the ones who locked me in. Pull the bolt, for God's sake!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You let them lock you in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grady/Delbert Grady</b></font>)</div>Grady's voice registered well-bred surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
dear. A woman half your size and a little boy? Hardly sets you off as being of
top managerial timber, does it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>A pulse began to beat in the clockspring of veins at Jack's right temple. ``Let

<p/>me out, Grady. I'll take care of them.''
``Will you indeed, sir? I wonder.'' Well-bred surprise was replaced by well-bred
regret. ``I'm pained to say that I doubt it. I -- and others -- have really come to
believe that your heart is not in this, sir. That you haven't the ... the
belly for it''
``I do!'' Jack shouted. ``I do, I swear it!''
``You would bring us your son?''
``Yes! Yes!''
``Your wife would object to that very strongly, Mr. Torrance. And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) appears
to be ... somewhat stronger than we had imagined. Somewhat more resourceful.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) certainly seems to have gotten the better of you.''
Grady tittered.
``Perhaps, Mr. Torrance, we should have been dealing with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) all along.''
``I'll bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>), I swear it,'' Jack said. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face was against the door now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
was sweating. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) won't object. I swear she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) won't. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) won't be able to.''
``You would have to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), I fear,'' Grady said coldly.
``I'll do what I have to do. Just let me out.''
``You'll give your word on it, sir?'' Grady persisted.
``My word, my promise, my sacred vow, whatever in hell you want. If you -- ''
There was a flat snap as the bolt was drawn back. The door shivered open a
quarter of an inch. Jack's words and breath halted. For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) felt that
death itself was outside that door.
The feeling passed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) whispered: ``Thank you, Grady. I swear you won't regret it. I swear you
won't.''
There was no answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) became aware that all sounds had stopped except for
the cold swooping of the wind outside.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pushed the pantry door open; the hinges squealed faintly.
The kitchen was empty. Grady was gone. Everything was still and frozen beneath
the cold white glare of the fluorescent bars. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) eyes caught on the large
chopping block where the three of them had eaten their meals.
Standing on top of it was a martini glass, a fifth of gin, and a plastic dish
filled with olives.
Leaning against it was one of the roque mallets from the equipment shed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>) looked at it for a long time.
Then a voice much deeper and much more powerful than Grady's, spoke from
somewhere, everywhere ... from inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Grady</b></font>).
-LRB-Keep your promise, Mr. Torrance.-RRB-
``I will,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) heard the fawning servility in his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) own voice but was
unable to control it. <div class="bookquote">``I will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) walked to the chopping block and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) hand on the handle of the mallet.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) hefted it.
Swung it.
It hissed viciously through the air.
Jack Torrance began to smile.

HALLORANN,
GOING UP THE COUNTRY
It was quarter of two in the afternoon and according to the snow-clotted signs
and the Hertz Buick's odometer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>) was less than three miles from Estes Park
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>) finally went off the road.
In the hills, the snow was falling faster and more furiously than Hallorann
had ever seen -LRB-which was, perhaps, not to say a great deal, since Hallorann had
seen as little snow as he (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>) could manage in his (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>) lifetime-RRB-, and the wind was
blowing a capricious gale -- now from the west, now backing around to the north,
sending clouds of powdery snow across his (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>) field of vision, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>) coldly
aware again and again that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>) missed a turn he (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>) might well plunge two hundred
feet off the road, the Electra cartwheeling ass over teapot as it went down.
Making it worse was his (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>) own amateur status as a winter driver. It scared him (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>) to
have the yellow center line buried under swirling, drifting snow, and it scared
him (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>) when the heavy gusts of wind came unimpeded through the notches in the hills
and actually made the heavy Buick slew around. It scared him (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>) that the road
information signs were mostly masked with snow and you could flip a coin as to
whether the road was going to break right or left up ahead in the white drive-in
movie screen he (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>) seemed to be driving through. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>) was scared, all right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>) had
driven in a cold sweat since climbing into the hills west of Boulder and Lyons,
handling the accelerator and brake as if they were Ming vases. Between rock 'n'
roll tunes on the radio, the disc jockey constantly adjured motorists to stay
off the main highways and under no conditions to go into the mountains, because
many roads were impassable and all of them were dangerous. Scores of minor
accidents had been reported, and two serious ones: a party of skiers in a VW
microbus and a family that had been bound for Albuquerque through the Sangre de
Cristo Mountains. The combined score on both was four dead and five wounded. <div class="bookquote">``So
stay off those roads and get into the good music here at KTLK,''  (<font color='red'><b>the jock</b></font>)</div>the jock
concluded cheerily, and then compounded Hallorann's misery by playing <div class="bookquote">``Seasons
in the Sun.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We had joy, we had fun, we had -- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Terry</b></font>)</div>Terry Jacks gibbered happily, and
Hallorann snapped the radio off viciously, knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>Terry</b></font>) would have it back on in
five minutes. No matter how bad it was, it was better than riding alone through
this white madness.
-LRB-Admit it. Dis heah black boy has got at least one long stripe of yaller ...
and it runs rant up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ebberlubbin back!-RRB-
It wasn't even funny. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would have backed off before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) even cleared Boulder
if it hadn't been for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) compulsion that the boy was in terrible trouble. Even
now a small voice in the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) skull -- more the voice of reason than of
cowardice, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thought -- was telling him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to hole up in an Estes Park motel for the
night and wait for the plows to at least expose the center stripe again. That
voice kept reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>) of the jet's shaky landing at Stapleton, of that

<p/>sinking feeling that it was going to come in nose-first, delivering its
passengers to the gates of hell rather than at Gate 39, Concourse B. But reason
would not stand against the compulsion. It had to be today. The snowstorm was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) own bad luck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) would have to cope with it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) was afraid that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)
didn't, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) might have something much worse to cope with in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) dreams.
The wind gusted again, this time from the northeast, a little English on the
ball if you please, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) was again cut off from the vague shapes of the hills
and even from the embankments on either side of the road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) was driving through
white null.
And then the high sodium lights of the snowplow loomed out of the soup,
bearing down, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) horror he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) saw that instead of being to one side, the
Buick's nose was pointed directly between those headlamps. The plow was being
none too choosy about keeping its own side of the road, and Hallorann had
allowed the Buick to drift.
The grinding roar of the plow's diesel engine intruded over the bellow of the
wind, and then the sound of its airhorn, hard, long, almost deafening.
Hallorann's testicles turned into two small wrinkled sacs filled with shaved
ice. His (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>) guts seemed to have been transformed into a large mass of Silly Putty.
Color was materializing out of the white now, snow-clotted orange. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>) could
see the high cab, even the gesticulating figure of the driver behind the single
long wiper blade. He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) could see the V shape of the plow's wing blades, spewing
more snow up onto the road's left-hand embankment like pallid, smoking exhaust.
WHAAAAAAAAA! the airhorn bellowed indignantly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) squeezed the accelerator like the breast of a muchloved woman and the Buick
scooted forward and toward the right. There was no embankment over here; the
plows headed up instead of down had only to push the snow directly over the
drop.
-LRB-The drop, ah yes, the drop -- -RRB-
The wingblades on Hallorann's left, fully four feet higher than the Electra's
roof, flirted by with no more than an inch or two to spare. Until the plow had
actually cleared him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>), Hallorann had thought a crash inevitable. A prayer which
was half an inarticulate apology to the boy flitted through his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mind like a torn
rag.
Then the plow was past, its revolving blue lights glinting and flashing in
Hallorann's rearview mirror.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) jockeyed the Buick's steering wheel back to the left, but nothing doing.
The scoot had turned into a skid, and the Buick was floating dreamily toward the
lip of the drop, spurning snow from under its mudguards.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) flicked the wheel back the other way, in the skid's direction, and the
car's front and rear began to swap places. Panicked now, he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) pumped the brake
hard, and then felt a hard bump. In front of him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) the road was gone ... he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) was
looking into a bottomless chasm of swirling snow and vague greenish-gray pines
far away and far below.
-LRB-I'm going holy mother of Jesus I'm going off-RRB-
And that was where the car stopped, canting forward at a thirty-degree angle,
the left fender jammed against a guardrail, the rear wheels nearly off the
ground. When Hallorann tried reverse, the wheels only spun helplessly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) heart
was doing a Gene Krupa drumroll.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) got out -- very carefully he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) got out -- and went around to the Buick's back
deck.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was standing there, looking at the back wheels helplessly, when a cheerful
voice behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Hello there, fella. You must be shit right out of your
mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) turned around and saw the plow forty yards further down the road, obscured
in the blowing snow except for the raftered dark brown streak of its exhaust and
the revolving blue lights on top. The driver was standing just behind him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>),
dressed in a long sheepskin coat and a slicker over it. A blue-and-white
pinstriped engineer's cap was perched on his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) head, and Hallorann could hardly
believe it was staying on in the teeth of the wind.
-LRB-Glue. It sure-God must be glue.-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``Hi,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Can you pull me back onto the road?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I guess I could,''  (<font color='red'><b>driver</b></font>)</div>the plow driver said. <div class="bookquote">``What the hell you doing way up
here, mister? Good way to kill your ass.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Urgent business.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothin is that urgent,''  (<font color='red'><b>driver</b></font>)</div>the plow driver said slowly and kindly, as if
speaking to a mental defective. <div class="bookquote">``If you'd 'a hit that post a leetle mite harder,
nobody woulda got you out till All Fools' Day. Don't come from these parts, do
you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. And I wouldn't be here unless my business was as urgent as I say.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That so?''  (<font color='red'><b>The driver</b></font>)</div>The driver shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) stance companionably as if they were having
a desultory chat on the back steps instead of standing in a blizzard halfway
between hoot and holler, with Hallorann's car balanced three hundred feet above
the tops of the trees below.
<div class="bookquote">``Where you headed? Estes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, a place called the Overlook Hotel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. <div class="bookquote">``It's a little way
above Sidewinder -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>But the driver was shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) head dolefully.
<div class="bookquote">``I guess I know well enough where that is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Mister, you'll never get
up to the old Overlook. Roads between Estes Park and Sidewinder is bloody damn
hell. It's driftin in right behind us no matter how hard we push. I come through
drifts a few miles back that was damn near six feet through the middle. And even
if you could make Sidewinder, why, the road's closed from there all the way
across to Buckland, Utah. Nope.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Never make it, mister.
Never make it at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have to try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, calling on his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) last reserves of patience to
keep his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) voice normal. <div class="bookquote">``There's a boy up there -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Boy? Naw. The Overlook closes down at the last end of September. No
percentage keepin it open longer. Too many shit-storms like this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>)'s the son of the caretaker. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>)'s in trouble.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How would you know that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) patience snapped.
<div class="bookquote">``For Christ's sake are you going to stand there and flap y'jaw at me the rest
of the day? I know, I know! Now are you going to pull me back on the road or
not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Kind of testy, aren't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>the driver observed, not particularly perturbed.
<div class="bookquote">``Sure, get back in there. I got a chain behind the seat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div><p/>Hallorann got back behind the wheel, beginning to shake with delayed reaction
now. His (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) hands were numbed almost clear through. He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) had forgotten to bring
gloves.
The plow backed up to the rear of the Buick, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>) saw the driver get out
with a long coil of chain. Hallorann opened the door and shouted: <div class="bookquote">``What can I do
to help?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stay out of the way, is all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>the driver shouted back. <div class="bookquote">``This ain't gonna take
a blink,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Which was true. A shudder ran through the Buick's frame as the chain pulled
tight, and a second later it was back on the road, pointed more or less toward
Estes Park. The plow driver walked up beside the window and knocked on the
safety glass. Hallorann rolled down the window.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry I shouted at you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I been shouted at before,''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>the driver said with a grin. <div class="bookquote">``I guess you're sorta
strung up. You take these.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>A pair of bulky blue mittens dropped into
Hallorann's lap. <div class="bookquote">``You'll need em when you go off the road again, I guess. Cold
out. You wear em unless you want to spend the rest of your life pickin your nose
with a crochetin hook. And you send em back. My wife knitted em and I'm partial
to em. Name and address is sewed right into the linin. I'm Howard Cottrell, by
the way. You just send em back when you don't need em anymore. And I don't want
to have to go payin no postage due, mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. <div class="bookquote">``Thanks. One hell of a lot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You be careful. I'd take you myself, but I'm busy as a cat in a mess of
guitar strings.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's okay. Thanks again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) started to roll up the window, but Cottrell stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Cottrell</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``When you get to Sidewinder -- if you get to Sidewinder -- you go to Durkin's
Conoco. It's right next to the li`brey. Can't miss it. You ask for Larry Durkin.
Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) Howie Cottrell sent you and you want to rent one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cottrell</b></font>) snowmobiles.
You mention my name and show those mittens, you'll get the cut rate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thanks again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said.
Cottrell nodded. <div class="bookquote">``It's funny. Ain't no way you could know someone's in trouble
up there at the Overlook ... the phone's out, sure as hell. But I believe you.
Sometimes I get feelins.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I do, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah. I know you do. But you take care.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Howard Cottrell/Cottrell/Howard</b></font>)</div>Cottrell disappeared into the blowing dimness with a final wave, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cottrell</b></font>) engineer
cap still mounted perkily on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cottrell</b></font>) head. Hallorann got going again, the chains
flailing at the snowcover on the road, finally digging in enough to start the
Buick moving. Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>), Howard Cottrell gave a final good-luck blast on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cottrell</b></font>)
plow's airhorn, although it was really unnecessary; Hallorann could feel him (<font color='blue'><b>Cottrell</b></font>)
wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Cottrell</b></font>) good luck.
That's two shines in one day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cottrell</b></font>) thought, and that ought to be some kind of
good omen. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cottrell</b></font>) distrusted omens, good or bad. And meeting two people with the
shine in one day -LRB-when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cottrell</b></font>) usually didn't run across more than four or five in
the course of a year-RRB- might not mean anything. That feeling of finality, a
feeling

<p/>-LRB-like things are all wrapped up-RRB-
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cottrell</b></font>) could not completely define was still very much with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cottrell</b></font>). It was
The Buick wanted to skid sideways around a tight curve and Hallorann jockeyed
it carefully, hardly daring to breathe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>) turned on the radio again and it was
Aretha, and Aretha was just fine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>)'d share his (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>) Hertz Buick with her (<font color='blue'><b>Buick</b></font>) any day.
Another gust of wind struck the car, making it rock and slip around. Hallorann
cursed it and hunched more closely over the wheel. Aretha finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) song and
then the jock was on again, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>jock</b></font>) that driving today was a good way to get
killed.
Hallorann snapped the radio off.
***
He (<font color='blue'><b>jock</b></font>) did make it to Sidewinder, although he (<font color='blue'><b>jock</b></font>) was four and a half hours on the
road between Estes Park and there. By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>) got to the Upland Highway it
was full dark, but the snowstorm showed no sign of abating. Twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>)'d had to
stop in front of drifts that were as high as his (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>) car's hood and wait for the
plows to come along and knock holes in them. At one of the drifts the plow had
come up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Estes</b></font>) side of the road and there had been another close call. The
driver had merely swung around his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) car, not getting out to chew the fat, but he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>)
did deliver one of the two finger gestures that all Americans above the age of
ten recognize, and it was not the peace sign.
It seemed that as he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) drew closer to the Overlook, his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) need to hurry became
more and more compulsive. He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) found himself glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) wristwatch almost
constantly. The hands seemed to be flying along.
Ten minutes after he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) had turned onto the Upland, he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) passed two signs. The
whooping wind had cleared both of their snow pack so he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was able to read them.
SIDEWINDER 10, the first said. The second: ROAD CLOSED 12 MILES AHEAD DURING
WINTER MONTHS.
<div class="bookquote">``Larry Durkin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann muttered to himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) dark face was strained and
tense in the muted green glow of the dashboard instruments. It was ten after
six. <div class="bookquote">``The Conoco by the library. Larry -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And that was when it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) full-force, the smell of oranges and the
thought-force, heavy and hateful, murderous:
-LRB-GET OUT OF HERE YOU DIRTY NIGGER THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS YOU
NIGGER TURN AROUND TURN AROUND OR WE'LL KILL YOU HANG YOU UP FROM
A TREE LIMB YOU FUCKING JUNGLE-BUNNY COON AND THEN BURN THE BODY
THAT'S WHAT WE DO WITH NIGGERS SO TURN AROUND NOW-RRB-
Hallorann screamed in the close confines of the car. The message did not come
to him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) in words but in a series of rebuslike images that were slammed into his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>)
head with terrific force. He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) hands from the steering wheel to blot the
pictures out.
Then the car smashed broadside into one of the embankments, rebounded, slewed
halfway around, and came to a stop. The rear wheels spun uselessly.
Hallorann snapped the gearshift into park, and then covered his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>)
hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) did not precisely cry; what escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was an uneven huh-huh-huh
sound. His (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) chest heaved. He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) knew that if that blast had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) on a stretch
of road with a dropoff on one side or the other, he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) might well be dead now.

<p/>Maybe that had been the idea. And it might hit him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) again, at any time. He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) would
have to protect against it. He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was surrounded by a red force of immense power
that might have been memory. He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was drowning in instinct.
He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) hands away from his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) face and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) eyes cautiously. Nothing.
If there was something trying to scare him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) again, it wasn't getting through. He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>)
was closed off.
Had that happened to the boy? Dear God, had that happened to the little boy?
And of all the images, the one that bothered him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) the roost was that dull
whacking sound, like a hammer splatting into thick cheese. What did that mean? .
-LRB-Jesus, not that little boy. Jesus, please.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) dropped the gearshift lever into low range and fed the engine gas a little
at a time. The wheels spun, caught, spun, and caught again. The Buick began to
move, its headlights cutting weakly through the swirling snow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)
watch. Almost six-thirty now. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was beginning to feel that was very late
indeed.

REDRUM
Wendy Torrance stood indecisive in the middle of the bedroom, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>)
son, who had fallen fast asleep.
Half an hour ago the sounds had ceased. All of them, all at once. The
elevator, the party, the sound of room doors opening and closing. Instead of
easing her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) mind it made the tension that had been building in her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) even worse; it
was like a malefic hush before the storm's final brutal push. But Danny had
dozed off almost at once; first into a light, twitching doze, and in the last
ten minutes or so a heavier sleep. Even looking directly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) could barely
see the slow rise and fall of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) narrow chest.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) wondered when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had last gotten a full night's sleep, one without
tormenting dreams or long periods of dark wakefulness, listening to revels that
had only become audible -- and visible -- to her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) in the last couple of days, as the
Overlook's grip on the three of them tightened.
-LRB-Real psychic phenomena or group hypnosis?-RRB-
She (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) didn't know, and didn't think it mattered. What had been happening was
just as deadly either way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) looked at Danny and thought
-LRB-God grant he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lie still-RRB-
that if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was undisturbed, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might sleep the rest of the night through.
Whatever talent he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was still a small boy and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) needed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rest.
It was Jack she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had begun to worry about.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) grimaced with sudden pain, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) hand away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) mouth, and saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>)
had torn off one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) fingernails. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) nails were one thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>)'d always

<p/>tried to keep nice. They weren't long enough to be called hooks, but still
nicely shaped and
-LRB-and what are you worrying about your fingernails for?-RRB-
She (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) laughed a little, but it was a shaky sound, without amusement.
First Jack had stopped howling and battering at the door. Then the party had
begun again
-LRB-or did it ever stop? did it sometimes just drift into a slightly different
angle of time where they weren't meant to hear it?-RRB-
counterpointed by the crashing, banging elevator. Then that had stopped. In
that new silence, as Danny had been falling asleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) heard
low, conspiratorial voices coming from the kitchen almost directly below them.
At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had dismissed it as the wind, which could mimic many different
human vocal ranges, from a papery deathbed whisper around the doors and window
frames to a full-out scream around the eaves ... the sound of a woman fleeing
a murderer in a cheap melodrama. Yet, sitting stiffly beside Danny, the idea
that it was indeed voices became more and more convincing.
Jack and someone else, discussing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) escape from the pan try.
Discussing the murder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wife and son.
It would be nothing new inside these walls; murder had been done here before.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had gone to the heating vent and had placed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ear against it, but at
that exact moment the furnace had come on, and any sound was lost in the rush of
warm air coming up from the basement. When the furnace had kicked off again,
five minutes ago, the place was completely silent except for the wind, the
gritty spatter of snow against the building, and the occasional groan of a
board.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ripped fingernail. Small beads of blood were oozing up
from beneath it.
-LRB-Jack's gotten out.-RRB-
-LRB-Don't talk nonsense.-RRB-
-LRB-Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s gotten a knife from the kitchen or maybe the meat
cleaver. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) way up here right now, walking along the sides of the
risers so the stairs won't creak.-RRB-
-LRB-! You're insane !-RRB-
Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lips were trembling, and for a moment it seemed that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must have cried
the words out loud. But the silence held.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) felt watched.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) whirled around and stared at the night-blackened window, and a hideous
white face with circles of darkness for eyes was gibbering in at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), the face
of a monstrous lunatic that had been hiding in these groaning walls all alongIt was only a pattern of frost on the outside of the glass.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) breath out in a long, susurrating whisper of fear, and it seemed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heard, quite clearly this time, amused titters from somewhere.
-LRB-You're jumping at shadows. It's bad enough without that. By tomorrow morning,
you'll be ready for the rubber room.-RRB-
There was only one way to allay those fears and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew what it was.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have to go down and make sure Jack was still in the pantry.
Very simple. Go downstairs. Have a peek. Come back up. Oh, by the way, stop
and grab the tray on the registration counter. The omelet would be a washout,

<p/>but the soup could be reheated on the hotplate by Jack's typewriter.
-LRB-Oh yes and don't get killed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s down there with a knife.-RRB-
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) walked to the dresser, trying to shake off the mantle of fear that lay on
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Scattered across the dresser's top was a pile of change, a stack of
gasoline chits for the hotel truck, the two pipes Jack brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
everywhere but rarely smoked ... and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) key ring.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) picked it up, held it in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand for a moment, and then put it back down.
The idea of locking the bedroom door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had occurred, but it just didn't
appeal. Danny was asleep. Vague thoughts of fire passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind, and
something else nibbled more strongly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) let it go.
Wendy crossed the room, stood indecisively by the door for a moment, then took
the knife from the pocket of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) robe and curled her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) right hand around the
wooden haft.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pulled the door open.
The short corridor leading to their quarters was bare. The electric wall
flambeaux all shone brightly at their regular intervals, showing off the rug's
blue background and sinuous, weaving pattern.
-LRB-See? No boogies here.-RRB-
-LRB-No, of course not. They want you out. They want you to do something silly and
womanish, and that is exactly what you are doing.-RRB-
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hesitated again, miserably caught, not wanting to leave Danny and the
safety of the apartment and at the same time needing badly to reassure herself
that Jack was still .
safely packed away.
-LRB-Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is.-RRB-
-LRB-But the voices-RRB-
-LRB-There were no voices. It was your imagination. It was the wind.-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``It wasn't the wind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own voice made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) jump. But the deadly certainty in it made
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) go forward. The knife swung by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) side, catching angles of light and
throwing them on the silk wallpaper. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) slippers whispered against the carpet's
nap. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nerves were singing like wires.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reached the corner of the main corridor and peered around, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind
stiffened for whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might see there.
There was nothing to see.
After a moment's hesitation she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rounded the corner and began down the main
corridor. Each step toward the shadowy stairwell increased her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dread and made
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sleeping son behind, alone and unprotected.
The sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) slippers against the carpet seemed louder and louder in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
ears; twice she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looked back over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shoulder to convince herself that someone
wasn't creeping up behind her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reached the stairwell and put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand on the cold newel post at the top
of the railing. There were nineteen wide steps down to the lobby. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
counted them enough times to know. Nineteen carpeted stair risers, and nary a
Jack crouching on any one of them. Of course not. Jack was locked in the pantry
behind a hefty steel bolt and a thick wooden door.
But the lobby was dark and oh so full of shadows.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pulse thudded steadily and deeply in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) throat.

<p/>Ahead and slightly to the left, the brass yaw of the elevator stood mockingly
open, inviting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to step in and take the ride of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life.
-LRB-No thank you-RRB-
The inside of the car had been draped with pink and white crepe streamers.
Confetti had burst from two tubular party favors. Lying in the rear left corner
was an empty bottle of champagne.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sensed movement above her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and wheeled to look up the nineteen steps
leading to the dark second-floor landing and saw nothing; yet there was a
disturbing corner-of-the-eye sensation that things
-LRB-things-RRB-
had leaped back into the deeper darkness of the hallway up there just before
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes could register them.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looked down the stairs again.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) right hand was sweating against the wooden handle of the knife; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
switched it to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) left, wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) right palm against the pink terrycloth of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
robe, and switched the knife back. Almost unaware that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind had given her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
body the command to go forward, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) began down the stairs, left foot then right,
left foot then right, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) free hand trailing lightly on the banister.
-LRB-Where's the party? Don't let me scare you away, you bunch of moldy sheets!
Not one scared woman with a knife! Let's have a little music around here! Let's
have a little life!-RRB-
Ten steps down, a dozen, a baker's dozen.
The light from the first-floor hall filtered a dull yellow down here, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have to turn on the lobby lights either beside the
entrance to the dining room or inside the manager's office.
Yet there was light coming from somewhere else, white and muted.
The fluorescents, of course. In the kitchen.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) paused on the thirteenth step, trying to remember if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had turned them
off or left them on when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and Danny left. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) simply couldn't remember.
Below her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), in the lobby, highbacked chairs hulked in pools of shadow. The
glass in the lobby doors was pressed white with a uniform blanket of drifted
snow. Brass studs in the sofa cushions gleamed faintly like cat's eyes. There
were a hundred places to hide.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) legs stilted with fear, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) continued down.
Now seventeen, now eighteen, now nineteen.
-LRB-Lobby level, madam. Step out carefully.-RRB-
The ballroom doors were thrown wide, only blackness spilling out. From within
came a steady ticking, like a bomb. She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) stiffened, then remembered the clock on
the mantel, the clock under glass. Jack or Danny must have wound it ... or
maybe it had wound itself up, like everything else in the Overlook.
She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) turned toward the reception desk meaning to go through the gate and the
manager's office and into the kitchen. Gleaming dull silver, she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) could see the
intended lunch tray.
Then the clock began to strike, little tinkling notes.
Wendy stiffened, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) tongue rising to the roof of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mouth. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) relaxed.
It was striking eight, that was all. Eight o'clock
... five, six, seven ...
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) counted the strokes. It suddenly seemed wrong to move again until the

<p/>clock had stilled ...
... eight ... nine ...
-LRB-?? Nine ??-RRB-
... ten ... eleven ...
Suddenly, belatedly, it came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) turned back clumsily for the stairs,
knowing already she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was too late. But how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) have known?
Twelve.
All the lights in the ballroom went on. There was a huge, shrieking flourish
of brass. Wendy screamed aloud, the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cry insignificant against the
blare issuing from those brazen lungs.
<div class="bookquote">``Unmask!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the cry echoed. <div class="bookquote">``Unmask! Unmask!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then they faded, as if down a long corridor of time, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) alone again.
No, not alone.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) turned and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was coming for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
It was Jack and yet not Jack. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes were lit with a vacant, murderous glow;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) familiar mouth now wore a quivering, joyless grin.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had the roque mallet in one hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Thought you'd lock me in? Is that what you thought you'd do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The mallet whistled through the air. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stepped backward, tripped over a
hassock, fell to the lobby rug.
<div class="bookquote">``Jack -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You bitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``I know what you are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The mallet came down again with whistling, deadly velocity and buried itself
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) soft stomach. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) screamed, suddenly submerged in an ocean of pain. Dimly
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw the mallet rebound. It came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) with sudden numbing reality that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
meant to beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) to death with the mallet he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) tried to cry out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) again, to beg him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to stop for Danny's sake, but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breath had been knocked loose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could only force out a weak whimper,
hardly a sound at all.
<div class="bookquote">``Now. Now, by Christ,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, grinning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) kicked the hassock out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
way. <div class="bookquote">``I guess you'll take your medicine now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The mallet whickered down. Wendy rolled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) left, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) robe tangling above
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knees. Jack's hold on the mallet was jarred loose when it hit the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
had to stoop and pick it up, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ran for the stairs, the breath
at last sobbing back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stomach was a bruise of throbbing pain.
<div class="bookquote">``Bitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said through his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) grin, and began to come after her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You stinking
bitch, I guess you'll get what's coming to you. I guess you will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) heard the mallet whistle through the air and then agony exploded on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
right side as the mallet-head took her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) just below the line of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breasts,
breaking two ribs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fell forward on the steps and new agony ripped her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
struck on the wounded side. Yet instinct made her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) roll over, roll away, and the
mallet whizzed past the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face, missing by a naked inch. It struck the
deep pile of the stair carpeting with a muffled thud. That was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw the
knife, which had been jarred out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand by her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fall. It lay glittering on
the fourth stair riser.
<div class="bookquote">``Bitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) repeated. The mallet came down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shoved herself upward and it
landed just below her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) kneecap. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lower leg was suddenly on fire. Blood began
to trickle down her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) calf. And then the mallet was coming down again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) jerked

<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) head away from it and it smashed into the stair riser in the hollow between
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) neck and shoulder, scraping away the flesh from her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ear.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) brought the mallet down again and this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) rolled toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), down the
stairs, inside the arc of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) swing. A shriek escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) broken ribs
thumped and grated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shins with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) body while he (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was offbalance
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fell backward with a yell of anger and surprise, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) feet jigging to keep
their purchase on the stair riser. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thumped to the floor, the mallet
flying from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sat up, staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) for a moment with shocked eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll kill you for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) rolled over and stretched out for the handle of the mallet. Wendy forced
herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) feet. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) left leg sent bolt after bolt of pain all the way up to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hip. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face was ashy pale but set. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) leaped onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) back as his (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand
closed over the shaft of the roque mallet.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh dear God!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) screamed to the Overlook's shadowy lobby, and buried the
kitchen knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lower back up to the handle.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stiffened beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and then shrieked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had never heard
such an awful sound in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) whole life; it was as if the very boards and windows
and doors of the hotel had screamed. It seemed to go on and on while he (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) remained
board-stiff beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) weight. They were like a parlor charade of horse and
rider. Except that the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) red-and-black-checked flannel shirt was
growing darker, sodden, with spreading blood.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) collapsed forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) face, bucking her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) off on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hurt side,
making her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) groan.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lay breathing harshly for a time, unable to move. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was an excruciating
throb of pain from one end to the other. Every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) inhaled, something
stabbed viciously at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) neck was wet with blood from her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) grazed ear.
There was only the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) struggle to breathe, the wind, and the ticking
clock in the ballroom.
At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) forced herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) feet and hobbled across to the stairway.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) got there she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) clung to the newel post, head down, waves of faintness
washing over her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). When it had passed a little, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) began to climb, using her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
unhurt leg and pulling with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arms on the banister. Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked up,
expecting to see Danny there, but the stairway was empty.
-LRB-Thank God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) slept through it thank God thank God-RRB-
Six steps up she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had to rest, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) head down, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) blond hair coiled on and over
the banister. Air whistled painfully through her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) throat, as if it had grown
barbs. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) right side was a swollen, hot mass.
-LRB-Come on Wendy come on old girl get a locked door behind you and then look at
the damage thirteen more to go not so bad. And when you get to the upstairs
corridor you can crawl. I give my permission.-RRB-
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) drew in as much breath as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) broken ribs would allow and half-pulled,
half-fell up another riser. And another.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was on the ninth, almost halfway up, when Jack's voice came from behind
and below her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said thickly: <div class="bookquote">``You bitch. You killed me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Terror as black as midnight swept through her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulder
and saw Jack getting slowly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) feet.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) back was bowed over, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could see the handle of the kitchen knife
sticking out of it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes seemed to have contracted, almost to have lost

<p/>themselves in the pale, sagging folds of the skin around them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was grasping
the roque mallet loosely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) left hand. The end of it was bloody. A scrap of
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pink terrycloth robe stuck almost in the center.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll give you your medicine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) whispered, and began to stagger toward the
stairs.
Whimpering with fear, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began to pull herself upward again. Ten steps, a
dozen, a baker's dozen. But still the first-floor hallway looked as far above
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as an unattainable mountain peak. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was panting now, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) side shrieking in
protest. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair swung wildly back and forth in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face. Sweat stung
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes. The ticking of the domed clock in the ballroom seemed to fill her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
cars, and counterpointing it, Jack's panting, agonized gasps as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) began to
mount the stairs.

<p/><< 51 >>
HALLORANN ARRIVES
Larry Durkin was a tall and skinny man with a morose face overtopped with a
luxuriant mane of red hair. Hallorann had caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) was leaving the
Conoco station, the morose face buried deeply inside an army-issue parka. He (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) was
reluctant to do any more business that stormy day no matter how far Hallorann
had come, and even more reluctant to rent one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) two snowmobiles out to this
wild-eyed black man who insisted on going up to the old Overlook. Among people
who had spent most of their lives in the little town of Sidewinder, the hotel
had a smelly reputation. Murder had been done up there. A bunch of hoods had run
the place for a while, and cutthroat businessmen had run it for a while, too.
And things had been done up at the old Overlook that never made the papers,
because money has a way of talking. But the people in Sidewinder had a pretty
good idea. Most of the hotel's chambermaids came from here, and chambermaids see
a lot.
But when Hallorann mentioned Howard Cottrell's name and showed Durkin the tag
inside one of the blue mittens, the gas station owner thawed.
<div class="bookquote">``Sent you here, did he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Durkin/Larry Durkin/Larry</b></font>)</div>Durkin asked, unlocking one of the garage bays and
leading Hallorann inside. <div class="bookquote">``Good to know the old rip's got some sense left. I
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was plumb out of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) flicked a switch and a bank of very old and
very dirty fluorescents buzzed wearily into life. <div class="bookquote">``Now what in the tarnal
creation would you want up at that place, fella?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann's nerve had begun to crack. The last few miles into Sidewinder had
been very bad. Once a gust of wind that must have been tooling along at better
than sixty miles an hour had floated the Buick all the way around in a 360°
turn. And there were still miles to travel with God alone knew what at the other
end of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was terrified for the boy. Now it was almost ten minutes to

<p/>seven and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had this whole song and dance to go through again.
<div class="bookquote">``Somebody is in trouble up there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said very carefully. <div class="bookquote">``The son of the
caretaker.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who? Torrance's boy? Now what kind of trouble could he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) be in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann muttered. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt sick with the time this was
taking. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was speaking with a country man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew that all country men
feel a similar need to approach their business obliquely, to smell around its
corners and sides before plunging into the middle of dealing. But there was no
time, because now he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was one scared nigger and if this went on much longer he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
just might decide to cut and run.
<div class="bookquote">``Look,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Please. I need to go up there and I have to have a
snowmobile to get there. I'll pay your price, but for God's sake let me get on
with my business!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Durkin/Larry Durkin/Larry</b></font>)</div>Durkin said, unperturbed. <div class="bookquote">``If Howard sent you, that's good
enough. You take this ArcticCat. I'll put five gallons of gas in the can. Tank's
full. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll get you up and back down, I guess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, not quite steadily.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll take twenty dollars. That includes the ethyl.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann fumbled a twenty out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) wallet and handed it over. Durkin tucked
it into one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) shirt pockets with hardly a look.
<div class="bookquote">``Guess maybe we better trade jackets, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Durkin/Larry Durkin/Larry</b></font>)</div>Durkin said, pulling off his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>)
parka. <div class="bookquote">``That overcoat of yours ain't gonna be worth nothin tonight. You trade me
back when you return the snowsled.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, hey, I couldn't --''
 (<font color='red'><b>Durkin/Larry Durkin/Larry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't fuss with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Durkin/Larry Durkin/Larry</b></font>)</div>Durkin interrupted, still mildly. <div class="bookquote">``I ain't sending you
out to freeze. I only got to walk down two blocks and I'm at my own supper
table. Give it over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Slightly dazed, Hallorann traded his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) overcoat for Durkin's fur-lined parka.
Overhead the fluorescents buzzed faintly, reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) of the lights in the
Overlook's kitchen.
<div class="bookquote">``Torrance's boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Durkin/Larry Durkin/Larry</b></font>)</div>Durkin said, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Good-lookin little tyke,
ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>tyke</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>tyke</b></font>)'n his (<font color='blue'><b>tyke</b></font>) dad was in here a lot before the snow really flew. Drivin the
hotel truck, mostly. Looked to me like the two of em was just about as tight as
they could get. That's one little boy that loves his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) daddy. Hope he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s all
right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So do I.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hallorann zipped the parka and tied the hood.
<div class="bookquote">``Lemme help you push that out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Durkin/Larry Durkin/Larry</b></font>)</div>Durkin said. They rolled the snowmobile across
the oil-stained concrete and toward the garage bay. <div class="bookquote">``You ever drove one of these
before?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's nothing to it. The instructions are pasted there on the
dashboard, but all there really is, is stop and go. Your throttle's here, just
like a motorcycle throttle. Brake on the other side. Lean with it on the turns.
This baby will do seventy on hardpack, but on this powder you'll get no more
than fifty and that's pushing it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Durkin/Larry Durkin/Larry</b></font>)</div>Now they were in the service station's snow-filled front lot, and Durkin had
raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) voice to make himself heard over the battering of the wind. <div class="bookquote">``Stay on
the road!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) shouted at Hallorann's ear. ``Keep your eye on the guardrail posts

<p/>and the signs and you'll be all right, I guess. If you get off the road, you're
going to be dead. Understand?''
Hallorann nodded.
``Wait a minute!'' Durkin told him (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>), and ran back into the garage bay.
While he (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) was gone, Hallorann turned the key in the ignition and pumped the
throttle a little. The snowmobile coughed into brash, choppy life.
Durkin came back with a red and black ski mask.
``Put this on under your hood!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) shouted.
Hallorann dragged it on. It was a tight fit, but it cut the last of the
numbing wind off from his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) cheeks and forehead and chin.
Durkin leaned close to make himself heard.
``I guess you must know about things the same way Howie does sometimes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>)
said. ``It don't matter, except that place has got a bad reputation around here.
I'll give you a rifle if you want it.''
``I don't think it would do any good,'' Hallorann shouted back.
``You're the boss. But if you get that boy, you bring him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to Sixteen Peach
Lane. The wife'll have some soup on.''
``Okay. Thanks for everything.''
``You watch out!'' Durkin yelled. <div class="bookquote">``Stay on the road!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hallorann nodded and twisted the throttle slowly. The snowmobile purred
forward, the headlamp cutting a clean cone of light through the thickly falling
snow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) saw Durkin's upraised hand in the rearview mirror, and raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) own
in return. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) nudged the handlebars to the left and was traveling up Main
Street, the snowmobile coursing smoothly through the white light thrown by the
streetlamps. The speedometer stood at thirty miles an hour. It was ten past
seven. At the Overlook, Wendy and Danny were sleeping and Jack Torrance was
discussing matters of life and death with the previous caretaker.
Five blocks up Main, the streetlamps ended. For half a mile there were small
houses, all buttoned tightly up against the storm, and then only wind-howling
darkness. In the black again with no light but the thin spear of the
snowmobile's headlamp, terror closed in on him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) again, a childlike fear, dismal
and disheartening. He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) had never felt so alone. For several minutes, as the few
lights of Sidewinder dwindled away and disappeared in the rearview, the urge to
turn around and go back was almost insurmountable. He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) reflected that for all of
Durkin's concern for Jack Torrance's boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) had not offered to take the other
snowmobile and come with him (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>).
-LRB-That place has got a bad reputation around here.-RRB-
Clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) teeth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) turned the throttle higher and watched the needle on
the speedometer climb past forty and settle at forty-five. He (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) seemed to be going
horribly fast and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) was afraid it wasn't fast enough. At this speed it
would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) almost an hour to get to the Overlook. But at a higher speed he (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>)
might not get there at all.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) eyes glued to the passing guardrails and the dime-sized reflectors
mounted on top of each one. Many of them were buried under drifts. Twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) saw
curve signs dangerously late and felt the snowmobile riding up the drifts that
masked the dropoff before turning back onto where the road was in the
summertime. The odometer counted off the miles at a maddeningly slow clip -- five,
ten, finally fifteen. Even behind the knitted ski mask his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) face was beginning to

<p/>stiffen up and his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) legs were growing numb.
-LRB-Guess I'd give a hundred bucks for a pair of ski pants.-RRB-
As each mile turned over, his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) terror grew -- as if the place had a poison
atmosphere that thickened as you neared it. Had it ever been like this before?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) had never really liked the Overlook, and there had been others who shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>)
feeling, but it had never been like this.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) could feel the voice that had almost wrecked him (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) outside of Sidewinder
still trying to get in, to get past his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) defenses to the soft meat inside. If it
had been strong twenty-five miles back, how much stronger would it be now? He (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>)
couldn't keep it out entirely. Some of it was slipping through, flooding his (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>)
brain with sinister subliminal images. More and more he (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) got the image of a badly
hurt woman in a bathroom, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands up uselessly to ward off a blow, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Durkin</b></font>) felt more and more that the woman must be --
-LRB-Jesus, watch out!-RRB-
The embankment was looming up ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) like a freight train. Woolgathering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) had missed a turn sign. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) jerked the snowmobile's steering gear
hard right and it swung around, tilting as it did so. From underneath came the
harsh grating sound of the snowtread on rock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) thought the snowmobile was
going to dump him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>), and it did totter on the knife-edge of balance before halfdriving, half-skidding back down to the more or less level surface of the snowburied road. Then the dropoff was ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>), the headlamp showing an abrupt
end to the snowcover and darkness beyond that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) turned the snowmobile the
other way, a pulse beating sickly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) throat.
-LRB-Keep it on the road Dicky old chum.-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) forced himself to turn the throttle up another notch. Now the speedometer
needle was pegged just below fifty. The wind howled and roared. The headlamp
probed the dark.
An unknown length of time later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) came around a driftbanked curve and saw a
glimmering flash of light ahead. Just a glimpse, and then it was blotted out by
a rising fold of land. The glimpse was so brief he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was persuading himself it had
been wishful thinking when another turn brought it in view again, slightly
closer, for another few seconds. There was no question of its reality this time;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) had seen it from just this angle too many times before. It was the Overlook.
There were lights on the first floor and lobby levels, it looked like.
Some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) terror -- the part that had to do with driving off the road or
wrecking the snowmobile on an unseen curve -- melted entirely away. The snowmobile
swept surely into the first half of an S curve that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) now remembered
confidently foot for foot, and that was when the headlamp picked out the
-LRB-oh dear Jesus god what is it-RRB-
in the road ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>). Limned in stark blacks and whites, Hallorann first
thought it was some hideously huge timberwolf that had been driven down from the
high country by the storm. Then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) closed on it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) recognized it and horror
closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) throat.
Not a wolf but a lion. A hedge lion.
Its features were a mask of black shadow and powdered snow, its haunches wound
tight to spring. And it did spring, snow billowing around its pistoning rear
legs in a silent burst of crystal glitter.
Hallorann screamed and twisted the handlebars hard right, ducking low at the

<p/>same time. Scratching, ripping pain scrawled itself across his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) neck,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) shoulders. The ski mask was torn open down the back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was hurled from the
snowmobile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) hit the snow, plowed through it, rolled over.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) could feel it coming for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>). In his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) nostrils there was a bitter smell of
green leaves and holly. A huge hedge paw batted him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) in the small of the back and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) flew ten feet through the air, splayed out like a rag doll. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) saw the
snowmobile, riderless, strike the embankment and rear up, its headlamp searching
the sky. It fell over with a thump and stalled.
Then the hedge lion was on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>). There was a crackling, rustling sound.
Something raked across the front of the parka, shredding it. It might have been
stiff twigs, but Hallorann knew it was claws.
<div class="bookquote">``You're not there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann screamed at the circling, snarling hedge lion.
<div class="bookquote">``You're not there at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) struggled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) feet and made it halfway to the
snowmobile before the lion lunged, batting him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) across the head with a needletipped paw. Hallorann saw silent, exploding lights.
<div class="bookquote">``Not there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) said again, but it was a fading mutter. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) knees unhinged and
dropped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) into the snow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) crawled for the snowmobile, the right side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)
face a scarf of blood. The lion struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) again, rolling him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) back like
a turtle. It roared playfully.
Hallorann struggled to reach the snowmobile. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) needed was there. And
then the lion was on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) again, ripping and clawing.

<p/><< 52 >>
WENDY AND JACK
Wendy risked another glance over her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shoulder. Jack was on the sixth riser,
clinging to the banister much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was doing herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was still grinning,
and dark blood oozed slowly through the grin and slipped down the line of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
jaw. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) bared his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) teeth at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I'm going to bash your brains in. Bash them right to fuck in.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) struggled
up another riser.
Panic spurred her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), and the ache in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) side diminished a little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) pulled
herself up as fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could regardless of the pain, yanking convulsively at
the banister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) reached the top and threw a glance behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) seemed to be gaining strength rather than losing it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was only four
risers from the top, measuring the distance with the rogue mallet in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) left
hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pulled himself up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) right.
<div class="bookquote">``Right behind you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) panted through his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) bloody grin, as if reading her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mind.
<div class="bookquote">``Right behind you now, bitch. With your medicine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fled stumblingly down the main corridor, hands pressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) side.
The door to one of the rooms jerked open and a man with a green ghoulmask on

<p/>popped out. <div class="bookquote">``Great party, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) screamed into her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face, and pulled the
waxed string of a party-favor. There was an echoing bang and suddenly crepe
streamers were drifting all around her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). The man in the ghoulmask cackled and
slammed back into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fell forward onto the carpet, full-length. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
right side seemed to explode with pain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fought off the blackness of
unconsciousness desperately. Dimly she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could hear the elevator running again,
and beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) splayed fingers she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could see that the carpet pattern appeared
to move, swaying and twining sinuously.
The mallet slammed down behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) threw herself forward, sobbing.
Over her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shoulder she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw Jack stumble forward, overbalance, and bring the
mallet down just before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) crashed to the carpet, expelling a bright splash of
blood onto the nap.
The mallet head struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) squarely between the shoulder blades and for a
moment the agony was so great that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could only writhe, hands opening and
clenching. Something inside her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had snapped -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had heard it clearly, and for a
few moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was aware only in a muted, muffled way, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) were merely
observing these things through a cloudy wrapping of gauze.
Then full consciousness came back, terror and pain with it.
Jack was trying to get up so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could finish the job.
Wendy tried to stand and found it was impossible. Electric bolts seemed to
course up and down her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) back at the effort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) began to crawl along in a
sidestroke motion. Jack was crawling after her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), using the roque mallet as a
crutch or a cane.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) reached the comer and pulled herself around it, using her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hands to yank at
the angle of the wall. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) terror deepened -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would not have believed that
possible, but it was. It was a hundred times worse not to be able to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) or
know how close he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was getting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) tore out fistfuls of the carpet napping
pulling herself along, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was halfway down this short hall before she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
noticed the bedroom door was standing wide open.
-LRB-Danny! O Jesus-RRB-
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) forced herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knees and then clawed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) feet, fingers
slipping over the silk wallpaper. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) nails pulled little strips of it loose.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ignored the pain and halfwalked, half-shambled through the doorway as Jack
came around the far corner and began to lunge his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) way down toward the open door,
leaning on the roque mallet.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) caught the edge of the dresser, held herself up against it, and grabbed
the doorframe.
Jack shouted at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Don't you shut that door! Goddam you, don't you dare
shut it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) slammed it closed and shot the bolt. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) left hand pawed wildly at the
junk on the dresser, knocking loose coins onto the floor where they rolled in
every direction. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand seized the key ring just as the mallet whistled down
against the door, making it tremble in its frame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) got the key into the lock
on the second stab and twisted it to the right. At the sound of the tumblers
falling, Jack screamed. The mallet came down against the door in a volley of
booming blows that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) flinch and step back. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) be doing that
with a knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) back? Where was he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) finding the strength? She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wanted to
shriek Why aren't you dead? at the locked door.

<p/>Instead she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) turned around. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and Danny would have to go into the attached
bathroom and lock that door, too, in case Jack actually could break through the
bedroom door. The thought of escaping down the dumb-waiter shaft crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
mind in a wild burst, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) rejected it. Danny was small enough to fit
into it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would be unable to control the rope pull. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) might go crashing
all the way to the bottom.
The bathroom it would have to be. And if Jack broke through into there --
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wouldn't allow herself to think of it.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny, honey, you'll have to wake up n -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But the bed was empty.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had begun to sleep more soundly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had thrown the blankets and one
of the quilts over him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). Now they were thrown back.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll get you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack howled. <div class="bookquote">``I'll get .both of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Every other word was
punctuated with a blow from the roque hammer, yet Wendy ignored both. All of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
attention was focused on that empty bed.
<div class="bookquote">``Come out here! Unlock this goddam door!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Danny?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) whispered.
Of course ... when Jack had attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). It had come through to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), as
violent emotions always seemed to. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'d even seen the whole thing in a
nightmare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was hiding.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fell clumsily to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knees, enduring another bolt of pain from her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) swollen
and bleeding leg, and looked under the bed. Nothing there but dustballs and
Jack's bedroom slippers.
Jack screamed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) name, and this time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) swung the mallet, a long
splinter of wood jumped from the door and clattered off the hardwood planking.
The next blow brought a sickening, splintering crack, the sound of dry kindling
under a hatchet. The bloody mallet head, now splintered and gouged in its own
right, bashed through the new hole in the door, was withdrawn, and came down
again, sending wooden shrapnel flying across the room.
Wendy pulled herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) feet again using the foot of the bed, and hobbled
across the room to the closet. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) broken ribs stabbed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), making her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) groan.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) brushed the hung garments aside frantically; some of them slipped their
hangers and ballooned gracelessly to the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was not in the closet.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hobbled toward the bathroom and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) reached the door she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) glanced back
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shoulder. The mallet crashed through again, widening the hole, and then
a hand appeared, groping for the bolt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw with horror that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had left
Jack's key ring dangling from the lock.
The hand yanked the bolt back, and as it did so it struck the bunched keys.
They jingled merrily. The hand clutched them victoriously.
With a sob, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) way into the bathroom and slammed the door just as
the bedroom door burst open and Jack charged through, bellowing.
Wendy ran the bolt and twisted the spring lock, looking around desperately.
The bathroom was empty. Danny wasn't here, either. And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) caught sight of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) own bloodsmeared, horrified face in the medicine cabinet mirror, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was
glad. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had never believed that children should be witness to the little
quarrels of their parents. And perhaps the thing that was now raving through the
bedroom, overturning things and smashing them, would finally collapse before it

<p/>could go after her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) son. Perhaps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought, it might be possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) to
inflict even more damage on it ... kill it, perhaps.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) eyes skated quickly over the bathroom's machine-produced porcelain
surfaces, looking for anything that might serve as a weapon. There was a bar of
soap, but even wrapped in a towel she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) didn't think it would be lethal enough.
Everything else was bolted down. God, was there nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could do?
Beyond the door, the animal sounds of destruction went on and on, accompanied
by thick shouts that they would <div class="bookquote">``take their medicine''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``pay for what they'd
done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would <div class="bookquote">``show them who's boss,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>They were <div class="bookquote">``worthless puppies,''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>the both of them.
There was a thump as her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) record player was overturned, a hollow crash as the
secondhand TV's picture tube was smashed, the tinkle of windowglass followed by
a cold draft under the bathroom door. A dull thud as the mattresses were ripped
from the twin beds where they had slept together, hip to hip. Boomings as Jack
struck the walls indiscriminately with the mallet.
There was nothing of the real Jack in that howling, maundering, petulant
voice, though. It alternately whined in tones of selfpity and rose in lurid
screams; it reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) chillingly of the screams that sometimes rose in the
geriatrics ward of the hospital where she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had worked summers as a high school
kid. Senile dementia. Jack wasn't out there anymore. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was hearing the
lunatic, raving voice of the Overlook itself.
The mallet smashed into the bathroom door, knocking out a huge chunk of the
thin paneling. Half of a crazed and working face stared in at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). The mouth and
cheeks and throat were lathered in blood, the single eye she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could see was tiny
and piggish and glittering.
<div class="bookquote">``Nowhere left to run, you cunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it panted at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) through its grin. The mallet
descended again, knocking wood splinters into the tub and against the reflecting
surface of the medicine cabinet
-LRB-!! The medicine cabinet !!-RRB-
A desperate whining noise began to escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) whirled, pain temporarily
forgotten, and threw the mirror door of the cabinet back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) began to paw
through its contents. Behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) that hoarse voice bellowed: <div class="bookquote">``Here I come now!
Here I come now, you pig!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was demolishing the door in a machinelike frenzy.
Bottles and jars fell before her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) madly searching fingers -- cough syrup, Vaseline,
Clairol Herbal Essence shampoo, hydrogen peroxide, benzocaine -- they fell into
the sink and shattered.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand closed over the dispenser of double-edged razor blades just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
heard the hand again, fumbling for the bolt and the spring lock.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) slipped one of the razor blades out, fumbling at it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breath coming in
harsh little gasps. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had cut the ball of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thumb. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) whirled around and
slashed at the hand, which had turned the lock and was now fumbling for the
bolt.
Jack screamed. The hand was jerked back.
Panting, holding the razor blade between her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thumb and index finger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to try again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) slashed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) screamed again, trying
to grab her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) slashed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) again. The razor blade turned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
hand, cutting her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) again, and dropped to the tile floor by the toilet.
Wendy slipped another blade out of the dispenser and waited.

<p/>Movement in the other room --
-LRB-?? going away ??-RRB-
And a sound coming through the bedroom window. A motor. A high, insectile
buzzing sound.
A roar of anger from Jack and then -- yes, yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was sure of it -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was leaving
the caretaker's apartment, plowing through the wreckage and out into the hall.
-LRB-?? Someone coming a ranger Dick Hallorann ??-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``Oh God,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) muttered brokenly through a mouth that seemed filled with broken
sticks and old sawdust. <div class="bookquote">``Oh God, oh please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had to leave now, had to go find her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) son so they could face the rest of
this nightmare side by side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) reached out and fumbled at the bolt. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arm
seemed to stretch for miles. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) got it to come free. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) pushed the
door open, staggered out, and was suddenly overcome by the horrible certainty
that Jack had only pretended to leave, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was lying in wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>):
Wendy looked around. The room was empty, the living room too. Jumbled, broken
stuff everywhere.
The closet? Empty.
Then the soft shades of gray began to wash over her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fell down on the
mattress Jack had ripped from the bed, semiconscious.

HALLORANN LAID LOW
Hallorann reached the overturned snowmobile just as, a mile and a half away,
Wendy was pulling herself around the corner and into the short hallway leading
to the caretaker's apartment.
It wasn't the snowmobile he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) wanted but the gascan held onto the back by a pair
of elastic straps. His (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) hands, still clad in Howard Cottrell's blue mittens,
seized the top strap and pulled it free as the hedge lion roared behind him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) -- a
sound that seemed to be more in his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) head than outside of it. A hard, brambly
slap to his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) left leg, making the knee sing with pain as it was driven in a way
the joint had never been expected to bend. A groan escaped Hallorann's clenched
teeth. It would come for the kill any time now, tired of playing with him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) fumbled for the second strap. Sticky blood ran in his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) eyes.
-LRB-Roar! Slap!-RRB-
That one raked across his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) buttocks, almost tumbling him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) over and away from the
snowmobile again. He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) held on -- no exaggeration -- for dear life.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) had freed the second strap. He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) clutched the gascan to him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) as the lion
struck again, rolling him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) over on his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) back. He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) saw it again, only a shadow in
the darkness and falling snow, as nightmarish as a moving gargoyle. Hallorann
twisted at the can's cap as the moving shadow stalked him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>), kicking up snowpuffs.

<p/>As it moved in again the cap spun free, releasing the pungent smell of the
gasoline.
Hallorann gained his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) knees and as it came at him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>), lowslung and incredibly
quick, he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) splashed it with the gas.
There was a hissing, spitting sound and it drew back.
<div class="bookquote">``Gas!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann cried, his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) voice shrill and breaking. <div class="bookquote">``Gonna burn you, baby!
Dig on it awhile!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The lion came at him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) again, still spitting angrily. Hallorann splashed it
again but this time the lion didn't give. It charged ahead. Hallorann sensed
rather than saw its head angling at his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) face and he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) threw himself backward,
partially avoiding it. Yet the lion still hit his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) upper rib cage a glancing
blow, and a flare of pain struck there. Gas gurgled out of the can, which he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>)
still held, and doused his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) right hand and arm, cold as death.
Now he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) back in a snow angel, to the right of the snowmobile by
about ten paces. The hissing lion was a bulking presence to his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) left, closing in
again. Hallorann thought he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) could see its tail twitching.
He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) yanked Cottrell's mitten off his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) right hand, tasting sodden wool and
gasoline. He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) ripped up the hem of the parka and jammed his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) pants
pocket. Down in there, along with his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) keys and his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) change, was a very battered
old Zippo lighter. He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) had bought it in Germany in 1954. Once the hinge had
broken and he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) had returned it to the Zippo factory and they had repaired it
without charge, just as advertised.
A nightmare flood of thoughts flooding through his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) mind in a split second.
-LRB-Dear Zippo my lighter was swallowed by a crocodile dropped from an airplane
lost in the Pacific trench saved me from a Kraut bullet in the Battle of the
Bulge dear Zippo if this fucker doesn't go that lion is going to rip my head
off-RRB-
The lighter was out. He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) clicked the hood back. The lion, rushing at him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>), a
growl like ripping cloth, his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) finger flicking the striker wheel, spark, flame,
-LRB-my hand-RRB-
his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) gasoline-soaked hand suddenly ablaze, the flames running up the sleeve of
the parka, no pain, no pain yet, the lion shying from the torch suddenly blazing
in front of it, a hideous flickering hedge sculpture with eyes and a mouth,
shying away, too late.
Wincing at the pain, Hallorann drove his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) blazing arm into its stiff and
scratchy side.
In an instant the whole creature was in flames, a prancing, writhing pyre on
the snow. It bellowed in rage and pain, seeming to chase its flaming tail as it
zigzagged away from Hallorann.
He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) own arm deep into the snow, killing the flames, unable to take
his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) eyes from the hedge lion's death agonies for a moment. Then, gasping, he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) got
to his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) feet. The arm of Durkin's parka was sooty but unburned, and that also
described his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) hand. Thirty yards downhill from where he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) stood, the hedge lion
had turned into a fireball. Sparks flew at the sky and were viciously snatched
away by the wind. For a moment its ribs and skull were etched in orange flame
and then it seemed to collapse, disintegrate, and fall into separate burning
piles.
-LRB-Never mind it. Get moving.-RRB-

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) picked up the gascan and struggled over to the snowmobile. His (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>)
consciousness seemed to be flickering in and out, offering him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) cuttings and
snippets of home movies but never the whole picture. In one of these he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) was
aware of yanking the snowmobile back onto its tread and then sitting on it, out
of breath and incapable of moving for a few moments. In another, he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) was
reattaching the gascan, which was still half-full. His (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) head was thumping
horribly from the gasfumes -LRB-and in reaction to his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) battle with the hedge lion,
he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) supposed-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) saw by the steaming hole in the snow beside him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) had
vomited, but he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) was unable to remember when.
The snowmobile, the engine still warm, fired immediately. He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) twisted the
throttle unevenly and started forward with a series of neck-snapping jerks that
made his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) head ache even more fiercely. At first the snowmobile wove drunkenly
from side to side, but by half-standing to get his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) face above the windscreen and
into the sharp, needling blast of the wind, he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) drove some of the stupor out of
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) opened the throttle wider.
-LRB-Where are the rest of the hedge animals?-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) didn't know, but at least he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) wouldn't be caught unaware again.
The Overlook loomed in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>), the lighted first-floor windows throwing
long yellow rectangles onto the snow. The gate at the foot of the drive was
locked and he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) dismounted after a wary look around, praying he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) hadn't lost his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>)
keys when he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) lighter out of his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) pocket ... no, they were there. He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>)
picked through them in the bright light thrown by the snowmobile headlamp. He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>)
found the right one and unsnapped the padlock, letting it drop into the snow. At
first he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) didn't think he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) was going to be able to move the gate anyway; he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) pawed
frantically at the snow surrounding it, disregarding the throbbing agony in his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>)
head and the fear that one of the other lions might be creeping up behind him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) managed to pull it a foot and a half away from the gatepost, squeezed into
the gap, and pushed. He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) got it to move another two feet, enough room for the
snowmobile, and threaded it through.
He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) became aware of movement ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) in the dark. The hedge animals, all
of them, were clustered at the base of the Overlook's steps, guarding the way
in, the way out. The lions prowled. The dog stood with its front paws on the
first step.
Hallorann opened the throttle wide and the snowmobile leaped forward, puffing
snow up behind it. In the caretaker's apartment, Jack Torrance's head jerked
around at the high, wasplike buzz of the approaching engine, and suddenly began
to move laboriously toward the hallway again. The bitch wasn't important now.
The bitch could wait. Now it was this dirty nigger's turn. This dirty,
interfering nigger with his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) nose in where it didn't belong. First him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) and then
his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) son. He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) would show them. He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) would show them that ... that he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) ... that he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>)
was of managerial timber!
Outside, the snowmobile rocketed along faster and faster. The hotel seemed to
surge toward it. Snow flew in Hallorann's face. The headlamp's oncoming glare
spotlighted the hedge shepherd's face, its blank and socketless eyes.
Then it shrank away, leaving an opening. Hallorann yanked at the snowmobile's
steering gear with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) remaining strength, and it kicked around in a sharp
semicircle, throwing up clouds of snow, threatening to tip over. The rear end
struck the foot of the porch steps and rebounded. Hallorann was off in a flash

<p/>and running up the steps. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) stumbled, fell, picked himself up. The dog was
growling -- again in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) head -- close behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>). Something ripped at the shoulder
of the parka and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) was on the porch, standing in the narrow corridor Jack
had shoveled through the snow, and safe. They were too big to fit in here.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) reached the big double doors which gave on the lobby and dug for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) keys
again. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was getting them he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) tried the knob and it turned freely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) way in.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) cried hoarsely. <div class="bookquote">``Danny, where are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Silence came back.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes traveled across the lobby to the foot of the wide stairs and a harsh
gasp escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). The rug was splashed and matted with blood. There was a scrap
of pink terrycloth robe. The trail of blood led up the stairs. The banister was
also splashed with it.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh Jesus,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) muttered, and raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) voice again.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny! DANNY!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The hotel's silence seemed to mock him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) with echoes which were almost there,
sly and oblique.
-LRB-Danny? Who's Danny? Anybody here know a Danny? Danny, Danny, who's got the
Danny? Anybody for a game of spin the Danny? Pin the tail on the Danny? Get out
of here, black boy. No one here knows Danny from Adam.-RRB-
Jesus, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) come through everything just to be too late? Had it been done?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ran up the stairs two at a time and stood at the top of the first floor.
The blood led down toward the caretaker's apartment. Horror crept softly into
his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) veins and into his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) brain as he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) began to walk toward the short hall. The
hedge animals had been bad, but this was worse. In his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) was already sure
of what he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) was going to find when he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) got down there.
He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) was in no hurry to see it.
Jack had been hiding in the elevator when Hallorann came up the stairs. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
crept up behind the figure in the snowcoated parka, a blood- and gore-streaked
phantom with a smile upon its face. The roque mallet was lifted as high as the
ugly, ripping pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) back
-LRB-?? did the bitch stick me can't remember ??-RRB-
would allow.
<div class="bookquote">``Black boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``I'll teach you to go sticking your nose in other
people's business.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann heard the whisper and began to turn, to duck, and the roque mallet
whistled down. The hood of the parka matted the blow, but not enough. A rocket
exploded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head, leaving a contrail of stars ... and then nothing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) staggered against the silk wallpaper and Jack hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) again, the roque
mallet slicing sideways this time, shattering Hallorann's cheekbone and most of
the teeth on the left side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) jaw. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went down limply.
<div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Now, by Christ''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Where was Danny? He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had business with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) trespassing son.
Three minutes later the elevator door banged open on the shadowed third floor.
Jack Torrance was in it alone. The car had stopped only halfway into the doorway
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) had to boost himself up onto the hall floor, wriggling painfully like a
crippled thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) dragged the splintered roque mallet after him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>). Outside the
eaves, the wind howled and roared. Jack's eyes rolled wildly in their sockets.

<p/>There was blood and confetti in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hair.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) son was up here, up here somewhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could feel it. Left to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own
devices, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) might do anything: scribble on the expensive silk wallpaper with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
crayons, deface the furnishings, break the windows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was a liar and a cheat
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would have to be chastised ... harshly.
Jack Torrance struggled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) feet.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) called. <div class="bookquote">``Danny, come here a minute, will you? You've done
something wrong and I want you to come and take your medicine like a man.
Danny? Danny!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div><p/><< 54 >>
TONY
-LRB-Danny ...-RRB-
-LRB-Dannneee ...-RRB-
Darkness and hallways. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was wandering through darkness and hallways that
were like those which lay within the body of the hotel but were somehow
different. The silkpapered walls stretched up and up, and even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) craned
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) neck, Danny could not see the ceiling. It was lost in dimness. All the doors
were locked, and they also rose up to dimness. Below the peepholes -LRB-in these
giant doors they were the size of gunsights-RRB-, tiny skulls and crossbones had
been bolted to each door instead of room numbers.
And somewhere, Tony was calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>).
-LRB-Dannneee ...-RRB-
There was a pounding noise, one he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) knew well, and hoarse shouts, faint with
distance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) could not make out word for word, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) knew the text well enough
by now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) had heard it before, in dreams and awake.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) paused, a little boy not yet three years out of diapers, and tried to
decide where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) was, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) might be. There was fear, but it was a fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)
could live with. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) had been afraid every day for two months now, to a degree
that ranged from dull disquiet to outright, mind-bending terror. This he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) could
live with. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) wanted to know why Tony had come, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) was making the sound
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) name in this hall that was neither a part of real things nor of the
dreamland where Tony sometimes showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) things. Why, where --
<div class="bookquote">``Danny.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Far down the giant hallway, almost as tiny as Danny himself, was a dark
figure. Tony.
<div class="bookquote">``Where am I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) called softly to Tony.
<div class="bookquote">``Sleeping,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony</b></font>)</div>Tony said. <div class="bookquote">``Sleeping in your mommy and daddy's bedroom.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony</b></font>)</div>There was
sadness in Tony's voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony</b></font>)</div>Tony said. ``Your mother is going to be badly hurt. Perhaps killed.

<p/>Mr. Hallorann, too.''
``No!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) cried it out in a distant grief, a terror that seemed damped by these
dreamy, dreary surroundings. Nonetheless, death images came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>): dead frog
plastered to the turnpike like a grisly stamp; Daddy's broken watch lying on top
of a box of junk to be thrown out; gravestones with a dead person under every
one; dead jay by the telephone pole; the cold junk Mommy scraped off the plates
and down the dark maw of the garbage disposal.
Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) could not equate these simple symbols with the shifting complex reality
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) mother; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) childish definition of eternity. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) was not. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would continue to be when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) was not again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) could accept
the possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) own death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) had dealt with that since the encounter in
Room 217.
But not hers.
Not Daddy's.
Not ever.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) began to struggle, and the darkness and the hallway began to waver. Tony's
form became chimerical, indistinct.
``Don't!'' Tony called. ``Don't, Danny, don't do that!''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s not going to be dead! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s not!''
``Then you have to help her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Danny ... you're in a place deep down in your
own mind. The place where I am. I'm a part of you, Danny.''
``You're Tony. You're not me. I want my mommy * . . I want my mommy... ''
``I didn't bring you here, Danny. You brought yourself. Because you knew.''
``No -- ''
``You've always known,'' Tony continued, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) began to walk closer. For the
first time, Tony began to walk closer. ``You're deep down in yourself in a place
where nothing comes through. We're alone here for a little while, Danny. This is
an Overlook where no one can ever come. No clocks work here. None of the keys
fit them and they can never be wound up. The doors have never been opened and no
one has ever stayed in the rooms. But you can't stay long. Because it's coming.''
``It ...'' Danny whispered fearfully, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) did so the irregular pounding
noise seemed to grow closer, louder. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) terror, cool and distant a moment ago,
became a more immediate thing. Now the words could be made out. Hoarse,
huckstering; they were uttered in a coarse imitation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) father's voice, but
it wasn't Daddy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) knew that now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) knew
-LRB-You brought yourself. Because you knew.-RRB-
``Oh Tony, is it my daddy?'' Danny screamed. <div class="bookquote">``Is it my daddy that's coming to
get me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Tony didn't answer. But Danny didn't need an answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) knew. A long and
nightmarish masquerade party went on here, and had gone on for years. Little by
little a force had accrued, as secret and silent as interest in a bank account.
Force, presence, shape, they were all only words and none of them mattered. It
wore many masks, but it was all one. Now, somewhere, it was coming for him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). It
was hiding behind Daddy's face, it was imitating Daddy's voice, it was wearing
Daddy's clothes.
But it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) daddy.
It was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Daddy</b></font>) daddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got to help them!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) cried.
And now Tony stood directly in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>), and looking at Tony was like
looking into a magic mirror and seeing himself in ten years, the eyes widely
spaced and very dark, the chin firm, the mouth handsomely molded. The hair was
light blond like his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) mother's, and yet the stamp on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) features was that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>)
father, as if Tony -- as if the Daniel Anthony Torrance that would someday be --
was a halfling caught between father and son, a ghost of both, a fusion.
<div class="bookquote">``You have to try to help,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony</b></font>)</div>Tony said. <div class="bookquote">``But your father... he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s with the
hotel now, Danny. It's where he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) wants to be. It wants you too, because it's very
greedy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tony</b></font>)</div>Tony walked past him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>), into the shadows,
<div class="bookquote">``Wait!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Danny cried. <div class="bookquote">``What can I -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tony</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s close now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony</b></font>)</div>Tony said, still walking away. <div class="bookquote">``You'll have to run ...
hide ... keep away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). Keep away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tony, I can'tl''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tony</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you've already started,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tony</b></font>)</div>Tony said. <div class="bookquote">``You will remember what your father
forgot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) was gone.
And from somewhere near his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) father's voice came, coldly wheedling: <div class="bookquote">``Danny? You
can come out, doc. Just a little spanking, that's all. Take it like a man and it
will be all over. We don't need her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), doc. Just you and me, right? When we get
this little ... spanking ... behind us, it will be just you and me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>Danny ran.
Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), the thing's temper broke through the shambling charade of
normality.
<div class="bookquote">``Come here, you little shit! Right now! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Down a long hall, panting and gasping. Around a corner. Up a flight of stairs.
And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) went, the walls that had been so high and remote began to come down;
the rug which had only been a blur beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) feet took on the familiar black
and blue pattern, sinuously woven together; the doors became numbered again and
behind them the parties that were all one went on and on, populated by
generations of guests. The air seemed to be shimmering around him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), the blows of
the mallet against the walls echoing and re-echoing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) seemed to be bursting
through some thin placental womb from sleep to
***
the rug outside the Presidential Suite on the third floor; lying near him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) in a
bloody heap were the bodies of two men dressed in suits and narrow ties. They
had been taken out by shotgun blasts and now they began to stir in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
and get up.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) drew in breath to scream but didn't.
-LRB-!! FALSE FACES !! NOT REAL !!-RRB-
They faded before his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) gaze like old photographs and were gone.
But below him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), the faint sound of the mallet against the walls went on and on,
drifting up through the elevator shaft and the stairwell. The controlling force
of the Overlook, in the shape of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father, blundering around on the first
floor.

<p/>A door opened with a thin screeing sound behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).
A decayed woman in a rotten silk gown pranced out, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) yellowed and splitting
fingers dressed with verdigris-caked rings. Heavy-bodied wasps crawled
sluggishly over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), grinning with black lips. <div class="bookquote">``Come in and we
will daance the taaaango ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``False face!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hissed. <div class="bookquote">``Not real!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drew back from him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) in alarm, and in
the act of drawing back she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) faded and was gone.
<div class="bookquote">``Where are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it screamed, but the voice was still only in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
could still hear the thing that was wearing Jack's face down on the first floor
... and something else.
The high, whining sound of an approaching motor.
Danny's breath stopped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) throat with a little gasp. Was it just another
face of the hotel, another illusion? Or was it Dick? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) wanted -- wanted
desperately -- to believe it was Dick, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) didn't dare take the chance.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) retreated down the main corridor, and then took one of the offshoots, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
feet whispering on the nap of the carpet. Locked doors frowned down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) as
they had done in the dreams, the visions, only now he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was in the world of real
things, where the game was played for keeps.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) turned to the right and came to a halt, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) heart thudding heavily in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
chest. Heat was blowing around his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) ankles. From the registers, of course. This
must have been Daddy's day to heat the west wing and
-LRB-You will remember what your father forgot.-RRB-
What was it? He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) almost knew. Something that might save him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and Mommy? But Tony
had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) would have to do it himself. What was it?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) sank down against the wall, trying desperately to think. It was so hard ...
the hotel kept trying to get into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) head ... the image of that dark and
slumped form swinging the mallet from side to side, gouging the wallpaper ...
sending out puffs of plaster dust.
<div class="bookquote">``Help me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Tony, help me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) became aware that the hotel had grown deathly silent. The
whining sound of the motor had stopped
-LRB-must not have been real-RRB-
and the sounds of the party had stopped and there was only the wind, howling
and whooping endlessly.
The elevator whirred into sudden life.
It was coming up.
And Danny knew who -- what -- was in it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) bolted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) feet, eyes staring wildly. Panic clutched around his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) heart.
Why had Tony sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) to the third floor? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) was trapped up here. All the doors
were locked.
The attic!
There was an attic, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) had come up here with daddy the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) had
salted the rattraps around up there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tony</b></font>) hadn't allowed Danny to come up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
because of the rats. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was afraid Danny might be bitten. But the trapdoor which
led to the attic was set into the ceiling of the last short corridor in this
wing. There was a pole leaning against the wall. Daddy had pushed the trapdoor
open with the pole, there had been a ratcheting whir of counterweights as the

<p/>door went up and a ladder had swung down. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could get up there and pull the
ladder after him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ...
Somewhere in the maze of corridors behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), the elevator came to a stop.
There was a metallic, rattling crash as the gate was thrown back. And then a
voice -- not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head now but terribly real -- called out: <div class="bookquote">``Danny? Danny, come here
a minute, will you? You've done something wrong and I want you to come and take
your medicine like a man. Danny? Danny!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Obedience was so strongly ingrained in him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) actually took two automatic
steps toward the sound of that voice before stopping. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hands curled into
fists at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sides.
-LRB-Not real! False face! I know what you are! Take off your mask!-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``Danny!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it roared. <div class="bookquote">``Come here, you pup! Come here and take it like a man!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A
loud, hollow boom as the mallet struck the wall. When the voice roared out his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
name again it had changed location. It had come closer.
In the world of real things, the hunt was beginning.
Danny ran. Feet silent on the heavy carpet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ran past the closed doors, past
the silk figured wallpaper, past the fire extinguisher bolted to the corner of
the wall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hesitated, and then plunged down the final corridor. Nothing at the
end but a bolted door, and nowhere left to run.
But the pole was still there, still leaning against the wall where Daddy had
left it.
Danny snatched it up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) craned his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) neck to stare up at the trapdoor. There
was a hook on the end of the pole and you had to catch it on a ring set into the
trapdoor. You bad to --
There was a brand-new Yale padlock dangling from the trapdoor. The lock Jack
Torrance had clipped around the hasp after laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) traps, just in case his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>)
son should take the notion into his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) head to go exploring up there someday.
Locked. Terror swept him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>).
Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) it was coming, blundering and staggering past the Presidential
Suite, the mallet whistling viciously through the air.
Danny backed up against the last closed door and waited for it.

THAT WHICH WAS
FORGOTTEN
Wendy came to a little at a time, the grayness draining away, pain replacing
it: her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) back, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) leg, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) side ... she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) didn't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would be able to
move. Even her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fingers hurt, and at first she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) didn't know why.
-LRB-The razor blade, that's why.-RRB-
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) blond hair, now dank and matted, hung in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) brushed it away and

<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ribs stabbed inside, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) groan. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw a field of blue and white
mattress, spotted with blood. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) blood, or maybe Jack's. Either way it was
still fresh. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hadn't been out long. And that was important because --
-LRB-?Why?-RRB-
Because --
It was the insectile, buzzing sound of the motor that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) remembered first.
For a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fixed stupidly on the memory, and then in a single vertiginous
and nauseating swoop, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mind seemed to pan back, showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) everything at
once.
Hallorann. It must have been Hallorann. Why else would Jack have left so
suddenly, without finishing it ... without finishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>)?
Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was no longer at leisure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had to find Danny quickly and ...
and do it before Hallorann could put a stop to it.
Or had it happened already?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) could hear the whine of the elevator rising up the shaft.
-LRB-No God please no the blood the blood's still fresh don't let it have happened
already-RRB-
Somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) was able to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) feet and stagger through the bedroom and
across the ruins of the living room to the shattered front door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) pushed it
open and made it out into the hall.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) cried, wincing at the pain in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) chest. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hallorann! Is
anybody there? Anybody?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The elevator had been running again and now it came to a stop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) heard the
metallic crash of the gate being thrown back and then thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) heard a
speaking voice. It might have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) imagination. The wind was too loud to
really be able to tell.
Leaning against the wall, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) way up to the corner of the short
hallway. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) was about to turn the corner when the scream froze her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>), floating
down the stairwell and the elevator shaft:
<div class="bookquote">``Danny! Come here, you pup! Come here and take it like a man!''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Jack. On the second or third floor. Looking for Danny.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) got around the corner, stumbled, almost fell. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) breath caught in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>)
throat. Something
-LRB-someone?-RRB-
huddled against the wall about a quarter of the way down from the stairwell.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) began to hurry faster, wincing every time her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) weight came down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) hurt
leg. It was a man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) saw, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) drew closer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) understood the meaning
of that buzzing motor.
It was Mr. Hallorann. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) had come after all.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) eased to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) knees beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>), offering up an incoherent prayer that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>)
was not dead. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) nose was bleeding, and a terrible gout of blood had spilled
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) mouth. The side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) face was a puffed purple bruise. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) was
breathing, thank God for that. It was coming in long, harsh draws that shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>)
whole frame.
Looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) more closely, Wendy's eyes widened. One arm of the parka he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) was
wearing was blackened and singed. One side of it had been ripped open. There was
blood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) hair and a shallow but ugly scratch down the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) neck.
-LRB-My God, what's happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Danny!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the hoarse, petulant voice roared from above them. <div class="bookquote">``Get out here,
goddammit!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was no time to wonder about it now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) began to shake him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face
twisting at the flare of agony in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ribs. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) side felt hot and massive and
swollen.
-LRB-What if they're poking my lung whenever I move?-RRB-
There was no help for that, either. If Jack found Danny, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>),
beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) to death with that mallet as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had tried to do to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
So she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) shook Hallorann, and then began to slap the unbruised side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) face
lightly.
<div class="bookquote">``Wake up,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hallorann, you've got to wake up. Please ...
please ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>From overhead, the restless booming sounds of the mallet as Jack Torrance
looked for his (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) son.
***
Danny stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) back against the door, looking at the right angle where
the hallways joined. The steady, irregular booming sound of the mallet against
the walls grew louder. The thing that was after him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) screamed and howled and
cursed. Dream and reality had joined together without a seam.
It came around the corner.
In a way, what Danny felt was relief. It was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father. The mask of face
and body had been ripped and shredded and made into a bad joke. It was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
daddy, not this Saturday Night Shock Show horror with its rolling eyes and
hunched and hulking shoulders and blood-drenched shirt. It was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, by God,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it breathed. It wiped its lips with a shaking hand. <div class="bookquote">``Now you'll
find out who is the boss around here. You'll see. It's not you they want. It's
me. Me. Me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It slashed out with the scarred hammer, its double head now shapeless and
splintered with countless impacts. It struck the wall, cutting a circle in the
silk paper. Plaster dust puffed out. It began to grin.
<div class="bookquote">``Let's see you pull any of your fancy tricks now,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it muttered. <div class="bookquote">``I wasn't born
yesterday, you know. Didn't just fall off the hay truck, by God. I'm going to do
my fatherly duty by you, boy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said: <div class="bookquote">``You're not my daddy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>It stopped. For a moment it actually looked uncertain, as if not sure who or
what it was. Then it began to walk again. The hammer whistled out, struck a door
panel and made it boom hollowly.
<div class="bookquote">``You're a liar,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it said. <div class="bookquote">``Who else would I be? I have the two birthmarks, I
have the cupped navel, even the pecker, my boy. Ask your mother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're a mask,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. <div class="bookquote">``Just a false face. The only reason the hotel
needs to use you is that you aren't as dead as the others. But when it's done
with you, you won't be anything at all. You don't scare me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll scare you!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it howled. The mallet whistled fiercely down, smashing into
the rug between Danny's feet. Danny didn't flinch. <div class="bookquote">``You lied about me! You
connived with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)! You plotted against me! And you cheated! You copied that
final exam!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The eyes glared out at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) from beneath the furred brows. There was

<p/>an expression of lunatic cunning in them. <div class="bookquote">``I'll find it, too. It's down in the
basement somewhere. I'll find it. They promised me I could look all I want.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It
raised the mallet again.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, they promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said, <div class="bookquote">``but they lie.''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>The mallet hesitated at the
top of its swing.
***
Hallorann had begun to come around, but Wendy had stopped patting his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) cheeks.
A moment ago the words You cheated! You copied that final exam! had floated down
through the elevator shaft, dim, barely audible over the wind. From somewhere
deep in the west wing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was nearly convinced they were on the third floor and
that Jack -- whatever had taken possession of Jack -- had found Danny. There was
nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) or Hallorann could do now.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh doc,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) murmured. Tears blurred her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Son of a bitch broke my jaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann muttered thickly, <div class="bookquote">``and my head ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) worked to sit up. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) right eye was purpling rapidly and swelling shut.
Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) saw Wendy.
<div class="bookquote">``Missus Torrance -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shhhh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Where is the boy, Missus Torrance?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On the third floor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``With his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>***
<div class="bookquote">``They lie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said again. Something had gone through his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mind, flashing
like a meteor, too quick, too bright to catch and hold. Only the tail of the
thought remained.
-LRB-it's down in the basement somewhere-RRB-
-LRB-you will remember what your father forgot-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``You ... you shouldn't speak that way to your father,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>it said hoarsely. The
mallet trembled, came down. <div class="bookquote">``You'll only make things worse for yourself. Your...
your punishment. Worse.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>It staggered drunkenly and stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with
maudlin selfpity that began to turn to hate. The mallet began to rise again.
<div class="bookquote">``You're not my daddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny told it again. <div class="bookquote">``And if there's a little bit of my
daddy left inside you, he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) knows they lie here. Everything is a lie and a cheat.
Like the loaded dice my daddy got for my Christmas stocking last Christmas, like
the presents they put in the store windows and my daddy says there's nothing in
them, no presents, they're just empty boxes. Just for show, my daddy says.
You're it, not my daddy. You're the hotel. And when you get what you want, you
won't give my daddy anything because you're selfish. And my daddy knows that.
You had to make him (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) drink the Bad Stuff. That's the only way you could get him (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>),
you lying false face.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Liar! Liar!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The words came in a thin shriek. The mallet wavered wildly in
the air.
<div class="bookquote">``Go on and hit me. But you'll never get what you want from me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The face in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) changed. It was hard to say how; there was no melting
or merging of the features. The body trembled slightly, and then the bloody

<p/>hands opened like broken claws. The mallet fell from them and thumped to the
rug. That was all. But suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) daddy was there, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) in mortal
agony, and a sorrow so great that Danny's heart flamed within his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) chest. The
mouth drew down in a quivering bow.
<div class="bookquote">``Doc,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Torrance/Torrance</b></font>)</div>Jack Torrance said. <div class="bookquote">``Run away. Quick. And remember how much I love
you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh Danny, for God's sake -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) took one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father's bloody hands and kissed it.
<div class="bookquote">``It's almost over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>***
Hallorann got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) feet by propping his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) back against the wall and pushing
himself up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and Wendy stared at each other like nightmare survivors from a

<div class="bookquote">``We got to get up there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We have to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) haunted eyes stared into his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) chalk-pale face. <div class="bookquote">``It's too late,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said. <div class="bookquote">``Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) can only help himself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A minute passed, then two. Three. And they heard it above them, screaming, not
in anger or triumph now, but in mortal terror.
<div class="bookquote">``Dear God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann whispered. <div class="bookquote">``What's happening?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Has it killed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The elevator clashed into life and began to descend with the screaming, raving
thing penned up inside.
***
Danny stood without moving. There was no place he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could run where the Overlook
was not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) recognized it suddenly, fully, painlessly. For the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
life he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had an adult thought, an adult feeling, the essence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) experience in
this bad place -- a sorrowful distillation:
-LRB-Mommy and Daddy can't help me and I'm alone.-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``Go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said to the bloody stranger in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Go on. Get out of
here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It bent over, exposing the knife handle in its back. Its hands closed around
the mallet again, but instead of aiming at Danny, it reversed the handle, aiming
the hard side of the roque mallet at its own face.
Understanding rushed through Danny.
Then the mallet began to rise and descend, destroying the last of Jack
Torrance's image. The thing in the hall danced an eerie, shuffling polka, the
beat counterpointed by the hideous sound of the mallet head striking again and
again. Blood splattered across the wallpaper. Shards of bone leaped into the air
like broken piano keys. It was impossible to say just how long it went on. But
when it turned its attention back to Danny, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father was gone forever. What
remained of the face became a strange, shifting composite, many faces mixed

<p/>imperfectly into one. Danny saw the woman in 217; the dogman; the hungry boything that had been in the concrete ring.
<div class="bookquote">``Masks off, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it whispered. <div class="bookquote">``No more interruptions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The mallet rose for the final time. A ticking sound filled Danny's ears.
<div class="bookquote">``Anything else to say?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it inquired. <div class="bookquote">``Are you sure you wouldn't like to run? A
game of tag, perhaps? All we have is time, you know. An eternity of time. Or
shall we end it? Might as well. After all, we're missing the party.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It grinned with broken-toothed greed.
And it came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). What his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father had forgotten.
Sudden triumph filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face; the thing saw it and hesitated, puzzled.
<div class="bookquote">``The boiler!''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny screamed. <div class="bookquote">``It hasn't been dumped since this morning! It's
going up! It's going to explode!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>An expression of grotesque terror and dawning realization swept across the
broken features of the thing in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). The mallet dropped from its fisted
hands and bounced harmlessly on the black and blue rug.
<div class="bookquote">``The boiler!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it cried. <div class="bookquote">``Oh no! That can't be allowed! Certainly not! No! You
goddamned little pup! Certainly not! Oh, oh, oh -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny cried back at it fiercely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) began to shuffle and shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
fists at the ruined thing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Any minute now! I know it! The boiler,
Daddy forgot the boiler! And you forgot it, too!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, oh no, it mustn't, it can't, you dirty little boy, I'll make you take
your medicine, I'll make you take every drop, oh no, oh no -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It suddenly turned tail and began to shamble away. For a moment its shadow
bobbed on the wall, waxing and waning. It trailed cries behind itself like
wornout party streamers.
Moments later the elevator crashed into life.
Suddenly the shining was on him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
-LRB-mommy mr. hallorann dick to my friends together alive they're alive got to
get out it's going to blow going to blow sky-high-RRB-
like a fierce and glaring sunrise and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ran. One foot kicked the bloody,
misshapen roque mallet aside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't notice.
Crying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ran for the stairs.
They bad to get out.

<p/><< 57 >>
THE EXPLOSION
Hallorann could never be sure of the progression of things after that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
remembered that the elevator had gone down and past them without stopping, and
something had been inside. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) made no attempt to try to see in through the
small diamond-shaped window, because what was in there did not sound human. A

<p/>moment later there were running footsteps on the stairs. Wendy Torrance at first
shrank back against him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and then began to stumble down the main corridor to the
stairs as fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) could.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny! Danny! Oh, thank God! Thank God!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) swept him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) into a hug, groaning with joy as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Torrance</b></font>) pain.
-LRB-Danny.-RRB-
Danny looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother's arms, and Hallorann saw how the boy had
changed. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face was pale and pinched, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes dark and fathomless. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had lost weight. Looking at the two of them together, Hallorann thought
it was the mother who looked younger, in spite of the terrible beating she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
taken.
-LRB-Dick -- we have to go -- run -- the place -- it's going to-RRB-
Picture of the Overlook, flames leaping out of its roof. Bricks raining down
on the snow. Clang of firebells ... not that any fire truck would be able to
get up here much before the end of March. Most of all what came through in
Danny's thought was a sense of urgent immediacy, a feeling that it was going to
happen at any time.
<div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) began to move toward the two of them and at
first it was like swimming through deep water. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) sense of balance was screwed,
and the eye on the right side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face didn't want to focus. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) jaw was
sending giant throbbing bursts of pain up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) temple and down his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) neck, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) cheek felt as large as a cabbage. But the boy's urgency had gotten him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
going, and it got a little easier.
<div class="bookquote">``All right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked from Hallorann to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) son and back to
Hallorann. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, all right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We have to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not dressed ... my clothes...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny darted out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) arms then and raced down the corridor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) looked
after him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) vanished around the corner, back at Hallorann. <div class="bookquote">``What if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
comes back?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your husband?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s not Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Jack's dead. This place killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). This
damned place.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) struck at the wall with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) fist and cried out at the pain in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) cut fingers. <div class="bookquote">``It's the boiler, isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am. Danny says it's going to explode.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The word was uttered with dead finality. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know if I can get
down those stairs again. My ribs ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) broke my ribs. And something in my
back. It hurts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'll make it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. <div class="bookquote">``We'll all make it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
remembered the hedge animals, and wondered what they would do if they were
guarding the way out..
Then Danny was coming back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had Wendy's boots and coat and gloves, also his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
own coat and gloves.
<div class="bookquote">``Danny,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Your boots.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's too late,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes stared at them with a desperate kind of
madness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked at Dick and suddenly Hallorann's mind was fixed with an image
of a clock under a glass dome, the clock in the ballroom that had been donated
by a Swiss diplomat in 1949. The hands of the clock were standing at a minute to

<p/>midnight.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh my God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. <div class="bookquote">``Oh my dear God.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) clapped an arm around Wendy and picked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) up. He (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>diplomat</b></font>) other arm
around Danny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ran for the stairs.
Wendy shrieked in pain as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) squeezed the bad ribs, as something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) back
ground together, but Hallorann did not slow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) plunged down the stairs with
them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) arms. One eye wide and desperate, the other puffed shut to a slit.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked like a one-eyed pirate abducting hostages to be ransomed later.
Suddenly the shine was on him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) understood what Danny had meant when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
said it was too late. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could feel the explosion getting ready to rumble up
from the basement and tear the guts out of this horrid place.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ran faster, bolting headlong across the lobby toward the double doors.
***
It hurried across the basement and into the feeble yellow glow of the furnace
room's only light. It was slobbering with fear. It had been so close, so close
to having the boy and the boy's remarkable power. It could not lose now. It must
not happen. It would dump the boiler and then chastise the boy harshly.
<div class="bookquote">``Mustn't happen!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it cried. <div class="bookquote">``Oh no, mustn't happen!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It stumbled across the floor to the boiler, which glowed a dull red halfway up
its long tubular body. It was huffing and rattling and hissing off plumes of
steam in a hundred directions, like a monster calliope. The pressure needle
stood at the far end of the dial.
<div class="bookquote">``No, it won't be allowed!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the manager/caretaker cried.
It laid its Jack Torrance hands on the valve, unmindful of the burning smell
which arose or the searing of the flesh as the red-hot wheel sank in, as if into
a mudrut.
The wheel gave, and with a triumphant scream, the thing spun it wide open. A
giant roar of escaping steam bellowed out of the boiler, a dozen dragons hissing
in concert. But before the steam obscured the pressure needle entirely, the
needle had visibly begun to swing back.
<div class="bookquote">``I WIN!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it cried. It capered obscenely in the hot, rising mist, waving its
flaming hands over its head. <div class="bookquote">``NOT TOO LATE! I WIN! NOT TOO LATE! NOT TOO LATE!
NOT -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Words turned into a shriek of triumph, and the shriek was swallowed in a
shattering roar as the Overlook's boiler exploded.
***
Hallorann burst out through the double doors and carried the two of them
through the trench in the big snowdrift on the porch. He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) saw the hedge animals
clearly, more clearly than before, and even as he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) realized his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) worst fears were
true, that they were between the porch and the snowmobile, the hotel exploded.
It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) that it happened all at once, although later he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) knew that
couldn't have been the way it happened.
There was a flat explosion, a sound that seemed to exist on one low allpervasive note

<p/>-LRB-WHUMMMMMMMMM -- -RRB-
and then there was a blast of warm air at their backs that seemed to push
gently at them. They were thrown from the porch on its breath, the three of
them, and a confused thought
-LRB-this is what superman must feel like-RRB-
slipped through Hallorann's mind as they flew through the air. He (<font color='blue'><b>superman</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>superman</b></font>)
hold on them and then he (<font color='blue'><b>superman</b></font>) struck the snow in a soft billow. It was down his (<font color='blue'><b>superman</b></font>) shirt
and up his (<font color='blue'><b>superman</b></font>) nose and he (<font color='blue'><b>superman</b></font>) was dimly aware that it felt good on his (<font color='blue'><b>superman</b></font>) hurt cheek.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>superman</b></font>) struggled to the top of it, for that moment not thinking about the
hedge animals, or Wendy Torrance, or even the boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rolled over on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back so
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could watch it die.
***
The Overlook's windows shattered. In the ballroom, the dome over the
mantelpiece clock cracked, split in two pieces, and fell to the floor. The clock
stopped ticking: cogs and gears and balance wheel all became motionless. There
was a whispered, sighing noise, and a great billow of dust. In 217 the bathtub
suddenly split in two, letting out a small flood of greenish, noxious-smelling
water. In the Presidential Suite the wallpaper suddenly burst into flames. The
batwing doors of the Colorado Lounge suddenly snapped their hinges and fell to
the dining room floor. Beyond the basement arch, the great piles and stacks of
old papers caught fire and went up with a blowtorch hiss. Boiling water rolled
over the flames but did not quench them. Like burning autumn leaves below a
wasps' nest, they whirled and blackened. The furnace exploded, shattering the
basement's roofbeams, sending them crashing down like the bones of a dinosaur.
The gasjet which had fed the furnace, unstoppered now, rose up in a bellowing
pylon of flame through the riven floor of the lobby. The carpeting on the stair
risers caught, racing up to the first-floor level as if to tell dreadful good
news. A fusillade of explosions ripped the place. The chandelier in the dining
room, a two-hundred-pound crystal bomb, fell with a splintering crash, knocking
tables every which way. Flame belched out of the Overlook's five chimneys at the
breaking clouds.
-LRB-No! Mustn't! Mustn't! MUSTN'T!-RRB-
It shrieked; it shrieked but now it was voiceless and it was only screaming
panic and doom and damnation in its own ear, dissolving, losing thought and
will, the webbing falling apart, searching, not finding, going out, going out
to, fleeing, going out to emptiness, notness, crumbling.
The party was over.

<p/><< 57 >>
EXIT

<p/>The roar shook the whole facade of the hotel. Glass belched out onto the snow
and twinkled there like jagged diamonds. The hedge dog, which had been
approaching Danny and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother, recoiled away from it, its green and shadowmarbled ears flattening, its tail coming down between its legs as its haunches
flattened abjectly. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head, Hallorann heard it whine fearfully, and mixed
with that sound was the fearful, confused yowling of the big cats. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) struggled
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) feet to go to the other two and help them, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) did so he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) saw
something more nightmarish than all the rest: the hedge rabbit, still coated
with snow, was battering itself crazily at the chainlink fence at the far end of
the playground, and the steel mesh was jingling with a kind of nightmare music,
like a spectral zither. Even from here he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could hear the sounds of the close-set
twigs and branches which made up its body cracking and crunching like breaking
bones.
<div class="bookquote">``Dick! Dick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny cried out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was trying to support his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother, help her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
over to the snowmobile. The clothes he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had carried out for the two of them were
scattered between where they had fallen and where they now stood. Hallorann was
suddenly aware that the woman was in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nightclothes, Danny jacketless, and it
was no more than ten above zero.
-LRB-my gad she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bare feet-RRB-
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) struggled back through the snow, picking up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coat, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) boots, Danny's
coat, odd gloves. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) ran back to them, plunging hip-deep in the snow from
time to time, having to flounder his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) way out.
Wendy was horribly pale, the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) neck coated with blood, blood that
was now freezing.
<div class="bookquote">``I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) muttered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was no more than semiconscious. <div class="bookquote">``No, I ...
can't. Sorry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny looked up at Hallorann pleadingly.
<div class="bookquote">``Gonna be okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, and gripped her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) again. <div class="bookquote">``Come on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The three of them made it to where the snowmobile had slewed around and
stalled out. Hallorann sat the woman down on the passenger seat and put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coat
on. He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet up -- they were very cold but not frozen yet -- and rubbed
them briskly with Danny's jacket before putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) boots. Wendy's face was
alabaster pale, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes halflidded and dazed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had begun to shiver.
Hallorann thought that was a good sign.
Behind them, a series of three explosions rocked the hotel. Orange flashes lit
the snow.
Danny put his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mouth close to Hallorann's ear and screamed something.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I said do you need that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div>The boy was pointing at the red gascan that leaned at an angle in the snow.
<div class="bookquote">``I guess we do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) picked it up and sloshed it. Still gas in there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) couldn't tell how much.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) attached the can to the back of the snowmobile, fumbling the job several
times before getting it right because his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fingers were going numb. For the first
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) became aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'d lost Howard Cottrell's mittens.
-LRB-i get out of this i gonna have my sister knit you a dozen pair, howie-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get on!''  (<font color='red'><b>dozen</b></font>)</div>Hallorann shouted at the boy.
Danny shrank back. <div class="bookquote">``We'll freeze!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We have to go around to the equipment shed! There's stuff in there ...
blankets ... stuff like that. Get on behind your mother!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny got on, and Hallorann twisted his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) head so he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) could shout into Wendy's
face.
<div class="bookquote">``Missus Torrance! Hold onto me! You understand? Hold on!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arms around him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cheek against his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) back. Hallorann
started the snowmobile and turned the throttle delicately so they would start up
without a jerk. The woman had the weakest sort of grip on him (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>), and if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
shifted backward, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) weight would tumble both her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and the boy off.
They began to move. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) brought the snowmobile around in a circle and then they
were traveling west parallel to the hotel. Hallorann cut in more to circle
around behind it to the equipment shed.
They had a momentarily clear view into the Overlook's lobby. The gasflame
coming up through the shattered floor was like a giant birthday candle, fierce
yellow at its heart and blue around its flickering edges. In that moment it
seemed only to be lighting, not destroying. They could see the registration desk
with its silver bell, the credit card decals, the old-fashioned, scrolled cash
register, the small figured throw rugs, the highbacked chairs, horsehair
hassocks. Danny could see the small sofa by the fireplace where the three nuns
had sat on the day they had come up -- closing day. But this was the real closing
day.
Then the drift on the porch blotted the view out. A moment later they were
skirting the west side of the hotel. It was still light enough to see without
the snowmobile's headlight. Both upper stories were flaming now, and pennants of
flame shot out the windows. The gleaming white paint had begun to blacken and
peel. The shutters which had covered the Presidential Suite's picture window --
shutters Jack had carefully fastened as per instructions in mid-October -- now hung
in flaming brands, exposing the wide and shattered darkness behind them, like a
toothless mouth yawing in a final, silent deathrattle.
Wendy had pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face against Hallorann's back to cut out the wind, and
Danny had likewise pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face against his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother's back, and so it was
only Hallorann who saw the final thing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) never spoke of it. From the
window of the Presidential Suite he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) saw a huge dark shape issue,
blotting out the snowfield behind it. For a moment it assumed the shape of a
huge, obscene manta, and then the wind seemed to catch it, to tear it and shred
it like old dark paper. It fragmented, was caught in a whirling eddy of smoke,
and a moment later it was gone as if it had never been. But in those few seconds
as it whirled blackly, dancing like negative motes of light, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) remembered
something from his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) childhood ... fifty years ago, or more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) brother
had come upon a huge nest of ground wasps just north of their farm. It had been
tucked into a hollow between the earth and an old lightning-blasted tree. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
brother had had a big old niggerchaser in the band of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hat, saved all the way
from the Fourth of July. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had lighted it and tossed it at the nest. It had
exploded with a loud bang, and an angry, rising hum -- almost a low shriek -- had
risen from the blasted nest. They had run away as if demons had been at their
beels. In a way, Hallorann supposed that demons had been. And looking back over

<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) shoulder, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had on that day seen a large dark cloud of
hornets rising in the hot air, swirling together, breaking apart, looking for
whatever enemy had done this to their home so that they -- the single group
intelligence -- could sting it to death.
Then the thing in the sky was gone and it might only have been smoke or a
great flapping swatch of wallpaper after all, and there was only the Overlook, a
flaming pyre in the roaring throat of the night.
***
There was a key to the equipment shed's padlock on his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) key ring, but Hallorann
saw there would be no need to use it.
The door was ajar, the padlock hanging open on its hasp.
<div class="bookquote">``I can't go in there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny whispered.
<div class="bookquote">``That's okay. You stay with your mom. There used to be a pile of old
horseblankets. Probably all moth-eaten by now, but better than freezin to death.
Missus Torrance, you still with us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the wan voice answered. <div class="bookquote">``I think so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good. I'll be just a second.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come back as quick as you can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hallorann nodded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had trained the headlamp on the door and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
floundered through the snow, casting a long shadow in front of himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
pushed the equipment shed door open and stepped in. The horseblankets were still
in the corner, by the roque set. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) picked up four of them -- they smelled musty and
old and the moths certainly had been having a free lunch -- and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) paused.
One of the rogue mallets was gone.
-LRB-Was that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hit me with?-RRB-
Well, it didn't matter what he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'d been hit with, did it? Still, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fingers
went to the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) face and began to explore the huge lump there. Six
hundred dollars' worth of dental work undone at a single blow. And after all
-LRB-maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) didn't hit me with one of those. Maybe one got lost. Or stolen. Or
took for a souvenir. After all-RRB-
it didn't really matter. No one was going to be playing rogue here next
summer. Or any summer in the foreseeable future.
No, it didn't really matter, except that looking at the racked mallets with
the single missing member had a kind of fascination. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) found himself thinking
of the hard wooden whack! of the mallet head striking the round wooden ball. A
nice summery sound. Watching it skitter across the
-LRB-bone. blood.-RRB-
gravel. It conjured up images of
-LRB-bone. blood.-RRB-
iced tea, porch swings, ladies in white straw hats, the hum of mosquitoes, and
-LRB-bad little boys who don't play by the rules.-RRB-
all that stuff. Sure. Nice game. Out of style now, but ... nice.
<div class="bookquote">``Dick?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The voice was thin, frantic, and, he (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) thought, rather unpleasant. <div class="bookquote">``Are
you all right, Dick? Come out now. Please!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Come on out now nigguh de massa callin youall.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-
His (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) hand closed tightly around one of the mallet handles, liking its feel.

<p/>-LRB-spare the rod, spoil the child.-RRB-
His (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) eyes went blank in the flickering, fire-shot darkness. Really, it would be
doing them both a favor. She (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) was messed up ... in pain... and most of it
-LRB-all of it-RRB-
was that damn boy's fault. Sure. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own daddy in there to burn.
When you thought of it, it was damn close to murder. Patricide was what they
called it. Pretty goddam low:
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hallorann?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) voice was low, weak, querulous. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't much like the
sound of it.
<div class="bookquote">``Dick!''  (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div>The boy was sobbing now, in terror.
Hallorann drew the mallet from the rack and turned toward the flood of white
light from the snowmobile headlamp. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feet scratched unevenly over the boards
of the equipment shed, like the feet of a clockwork toy that has been wound up
and set in motion.
Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stopped, looked wonderingly at the mallet in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands, and asked
himself with rising horror what it was he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been thinking of doing. Murder?
Had he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) been thinking of murder?
For a moment his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) entire mind seemed filled with an angry, weakly hectoring
voice:
-LRB-Do it! Do it, you weak-kneed no-balls nigger! Kill them! KILL THEM BOTH!-RRB-
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) flung the mallet behind him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with a whispered, terrified cry. It
clattered into the corner where the horseblankets had been, one of the two heads
pointed toward him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in an unspeakable invitation.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fled.
Danny was sitting on the snowmobile seat and Wendy was holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) weakly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
face was shiny with tears, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was shaking as if with ague. Between his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
clicking teeth he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Where were you? We were scared!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's a good place to be scared of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Even if that
place burns flat to the foundation, you'll never get me within a hundred miles
of here again. Here, Missus Torrance, wrap these around you. I'll help. You too,
Danny. Get yourself looking like an Arab.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) swirled two of the blankets around Wendy, fashioning one of them into a
hood to cover her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) head, and helped Danny tie his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) so they wouldn't fall off.
<div class="bookquote">``Now hold on for dear life,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We got a long way to go, but the worst
is behind us now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) circled the equipment shed and then pointed the snowmobile back along their
trail. The Overlook was a torch now, flaming at the sky. Great holes had been
eaten into its sides, and there was a red hell inside, waxing and waning.
Snowmelt ran down the charred gutters in steaming waterfalls.
They purred down the front lawns their way well lit. The snowdunes glowed
scarlet.
<div class="bookquote">``Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny shouted as Hallorann slowed for the front gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was pointing
toward the playground.
The hedge creatures were all in their original positions, but they were
denuded, blackened, seared. Their dead branches were a stark interlacing network
in the fireglow, their small leaves scattered around their feet like fallen
petals.
<div class="bookquote">``They're dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny screamed in hysterical triumph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead! They're dead!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shhh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said. <div class="bookquote">``All right, honey. It's all right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hey, doc,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said. <div class="bookquote">``Let's get to someplace warm. You ready?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny whispered. <div class="bookquote">``I've been ready for so long -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hallorann edged through the gap between gate and post. A moment later they
were on the road, pointed back toward Sidewinder. The sound of the snowmobile's
engine dwindled until it was lost in the ceaseless roar of the wind. It rattled
through the denuded branches of the hedge animals with a low, beating, desolate
sound. The fire waxed and waned. Sometime after the sound of the snowmobile's
engine had disappeared, the Overlooks roof caved in -- first the west wing, then
the east, and seconds later the central roof. A huge spiraling gout of sparks
and flaming debris rushed up into the howling winter night.
A bundle of flaming shingles and a wad of hot flashing were wafted through
the open equipment shed door by the wind.
After a while the shed began to burn, too.
***
They were still twenty miles from Sidewinder when Hallorann stopped to pour
the rest of the gas into the snowmobile's tank. He (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was getting very worried
about Wendy Torrance, who seemed to be drifting away from them. It was still so
far to go.
<div class="bookquote">``Dick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny cried. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was standing up on the seat, pointing. <div class="bookquote">``Dick, look!
Look there!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The snow had stopped and a silver-dollar moon had peeked out through the
raftering clouds. Far down the road but coming toward them, coming upward
through a series of S-shaped switchbacks, was a pearly chain of lights. The wind
dropped for a moment and Hallorann heard the faraway buzzing snarl of snowmobile
engines.
Hallorann and Danny and Wendy reached them fifteen minutes later. They had
brought extra clothes and brandy and Dr. Edmunds.
And the long darkness was over.

EPILOGUE/SUMMER
After he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had finished checking over the salads his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) understudy had made and
peeked in on the home-baked beans they were using as appetizers this week,
Hallorann untied his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) apron, hung it on a hook, and slipped out the back door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
had maybe forty-five minutes before he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had to crank up for dinner in earnest.
The name of this place was the Red Arrow Lodge, and it was buried in the

<p/>western Maine mountains, thirty miles from the town of Rangely. It was a good
gig, Hallorann thought. The trade wasn't too heavy, it tipped well, and so far
there hadn't been a single meal sent back. Not bad at all, considering the
season was nearly half over.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) threaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) way between the outdoor bar and the swimming pool -LRB-although
why anyone would want to use the pool with the lake so handy he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) would never
know-RRB-, crossed a greensward where a party of four was playing croquet and
laughing, and crested a mild ridge. Pines took over here, and the wind soughed
pleasantly in them, carrying the aroma of fir and sweet resin.
On the other side, a number of cabins with views of the lake were placed
discreetly among the trees. The last one was the nicest, and Hallorann had
reserved it for a party of two back in April when he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had gotten this gig.
The woman was sitting on the porch in a rocking chair, a book in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands.
Hallorann was struck again by the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Part of it was the stiff,
almost formal way she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) informal surroundings -- that was the
back brace, of course. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d had a shattered vertebra as well as three broken
ribs and some internal injuries. The back was the slowest healing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
still in the brace ... hence the formal posture. But the change was more than
that. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked older, and some of the laughter had gone out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face. Now,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat reading her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) book, Hallorann saw a grave sort of beauty there that had
been missing on the day he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had first met her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), some nine months ago. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
still been mostly girl. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a woman, a human being who had been dragged
around to the dark side of the moon and had come back able to put the pieces
back together. But those pieces, Hallorann thought, they never fit just the same
way again. Never in this world.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) step and looked up, closing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) book. <div class="bookquote">``Dick! Hi!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) started to
rise, and a little grimace of pain crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Nope, don't get up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't stand on no ceremony unless it's white
tie and tails.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came up the steps and sat down next to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on the porch.
<div class="bookquote">``How is it going?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pretty fair,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) admitted. <div class="bookquote">``You try the shrimp creole tonight. You gonna like
it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's a deal.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where's Danny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right down there.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pointed, and Hallorann saw a small figure sitting at
the end of the dock. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was wearing jeans rolled up to the knee and a redstriped shirt. Further out on the calm water, a bobber floated. Every now and
then Danny would reel it in, examine the sinker and hook below it, and then toss
it out again.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s gettin brown,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes. Very brown.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hallorann</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) fondly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) took out a cigarette, tamped it, lit it. The smoke raftered away lazily in
the sunny afternoon. <div class="bookquote">``What about those dreams he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s been havin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>Wendy said. <div class="bookquote">``Only one this week. It used to be every night,
sometimes two and three times. The explosions. The hedges. And most of all ...
you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s going to be okay, Wendy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)? I wonder.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hallorann nodded. <div class="bookquote">``You and him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), you're coming back. Different, maybe, but
okay. You ain't what you were, you two, but that isn't necessarily bad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/Wendy Torrance</b></font>)</div>They were silent for a while, Wendy moving the rocking chair back and forth a
little, Hallorann with his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) feet up on the porch rail, smoking. A little breeze
came up, pushing its secret way through the pines but barely ruffling Wendy's
hair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had cut it short.
<div class="bookquote">``I've decided to take Al -- Mr. Shockley -- up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Shockley</b></font>) offer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said.
Hallorann nodded. <div class="bookquote">``It sounds like a good job. Something you could get
interested in. When do you start?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right after Labor Day. When Danny and I leave here, we'll be going right on
to Maryland to look for a place. It was really the Chamber of Commerce brochure
that convinced me, you know. It looks like a nice town to raise a kid in. And
I'd like to be working again before we dig too deeply into the insurance money
Jack left. There's still over forty thousand dollars. Enough to send Danny to
college with enough left over to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) a start, if it's invested right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hallorann nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Your mom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and smiled wanly. <div class="bookquote">``I think Maryland is far enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You won't forget old friends, will you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Danny wouldn't let me. Go on down and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)'s been waiting all day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, so have I.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) stood up and hitched his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) cook's whites at the hips. <div class="bookquote">``The
two of you are going to be okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Can't you feel it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and this time her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) smile was warmer. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)
took his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hand and kissed it. <div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I think I can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The shrimp creole,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said, moving to the steps. <div class="bookquote">``Don't forget.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I won't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) walked down the sloping, graveled path that led to the dock and then out
along the weather-beaten boards to the end, where Danny sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) feet in the
clear water. Beyond, the lake widened out, mirroring the pines along its verge.
The terrain was mountainous around here, but the mountains were old, rounded and
humbled by time. Hallorann liked them just fine.
<div class="bookquote">``Catchin much?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, sitting down next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) took off one
shoe, then the other. With a sigh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) hot feet down into the cool water.
<div class="bookquote">``No. But I had a nibble a little while ago.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We'll take a boat out tomorrow morning. Got to get out in the middle if you
want to catch an eatin fish, my boy. Out yonder is where the big ones lay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How big?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hallorann shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``Oh ... sharks, marlin, whales, that sort of thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There aren't any whales!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No blue whales, no. Of course not. These ones here run to no more than eighty
feet. Pink whales.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How could they get here from the ocean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>Hallorann put a hand on the boy's reddish-gold hair and rumpled it. <div class="bookquote">``They swim
upstream, my boy. That's how.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They were silent for a time, looking out over the stillness of the lake,
Hallorann just thinking. When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked back at Danny, he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) eyes had

<p/>filled with tears.
Putting an arm around him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``What's this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny whispered.
<div class="bookquote">``You're missin your dad, aren't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny nodded. <div class="bookquote">``You always know.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>One of the tears spilled from the corner of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) right eye and trickled slowly down his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) cheek.
<div class="bookquote">``We can't have any secrets,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann agreed. <div class="bookquote">``That's just how it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pole, Danny said: <div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I wish it had been me. It was my
fault. All my fault.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, <div class="bookquote">``You don't like to talk about it around your mom, do you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) wants to forget it ever happened. So do I, but -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you can't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``No.°.
``Do you need to cry?''
The boy tried to answer, but the words were swallowed in a sob. He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
head against Hallorann's shoulder and wept, the tears now flooding down his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>)
face. Hallorann held him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) and said nothing. The boy would have to shed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tears
again and again, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew, and it was Danny's luck that he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) was still young enough
to be able to do that. The tears that heal are also the tears that scald and
scourge.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) had quieted a little, Hallorann said, ``You're gonna get over this. You
don't think you are right now, but you will. You got the shi -- ''
``I wish I didn't!'' Danny choked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) voice still thick with tears. ``I wish I
didn't have it!''
``But you do,'' Hallorann said quietly. ``For better or worse. You didn't get no
say, little boy. But the worst is over. You can use it to talk to me when things
get rough. And if they get too rough, you just call me and I'll come.''
``Even if I'm down in Maryland?''
``Even there.''
They were quiet, watching Danny's bobber drift around thirty feet out from the
end of the dock. Then Danny said, almost too low to be heard, ``You'll be my
friend?''
``As long as you want me.''
The boy held him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) tight and Hallorann hugged him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Danny? You listen to me. I'm going to talk to you about it this once and
never again this same way. There's some things no six-year-old boy in the world
should have to be told, but the way things should be and the way things are
hardly ever get together. The world's a hard place, Danny. It don't care. It
don't hate you and me, but it don't love us, either. Terrible things happen in
the world, and they're things no one can explain. Good people die in bad,
painful ways and leave the folks that love them all alone. Sometimes it seems
like it's only the bad people who stay healthy and prosper. The world don't love
you, but your momma does and so do I. You're a good boy. You grieve for your
daddy, and when you feel you have to cry over what happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>), you go into
a closet or under your covers and cry until it's all out of you again. That's
what a good son has to do. But see that you get on. That's your job in this hard
world, to keep your love alive and see that you get on, no matter what. Pull
your act together and just go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny whispered. <div class="bookquote">``I'll come see you again next summer if you want
... if you don't mind. Next summer I'm going to be seven.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And I'll be sixty-two. And I'm gonna hug your brains out your ears. But let's
finish one summer before we get on to the next.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) looked at Hallorann. <div class="bookquote">``Dick?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hmm?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You won't die for a long time, will you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure not studyin on it. Are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, sir. I -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You got a bite, sonny.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) pointed. The red and white bobber had ducked
under. It came up again glistening, and then went under again.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>Danny/Torrance/Danny Torrance</b></font>)</div>Danny gulped.
Wendy had come down and now joined them, standing in back of Danny. <div class="bookquote">``What is
it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Pickerel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>Hallorann said, <div class="bookquote">``I believe that's a pink whale.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallorann/Mrs. Hallorann</b></font>)</div>The tip of the fishing rod bent. Danny pulled it back and a long fish,
rainbow-colored, flashed up in a sunny, winking parabola, and disappeared again.
Danny reeled frantically, gulping.
<div class="bookquote">``Help me, Dick! I got him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)! I got him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)! Help me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hallorann laughed. <div class="bookquote">``You're doin fine all by yourself, little man. I don't know
if it's a pink whale or a trout, but it'll do. It'll do just fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) put an arm around Danny's shoulders and the boy reeled the fish in, little
by little. Wendy sat down on Danny's other side and the three of them sat on the
end of the dock in the afternoon sun.
