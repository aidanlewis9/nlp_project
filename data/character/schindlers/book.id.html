Autumn, 1943
In Poland's deepest autumn, a tall young man in an expensive overcoat, double-breasted
dinner jacket beneath it and--in the lapel of the dinner jacket--a large ornamental goldon-black-enamel
Hakenkreuz -LRB-swastika-RRB- emerged from a fashionable apartment building
in Straszewskiego Street, on the edge of the ancient center of Cracow, and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
chauffeur waiting with fuming breath by the open door of an enormous and, even in this
blackened world, lustrous Adler limousine. <div class="bookquote">``Watch the pavement, Herr Schindler,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chauffeur</b></font>)</div>said
the chauffeur. <div class="bookquote">``It's as icy as a widow's heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>In observing this small winter scene, we
are on safe ground. The tall young man would to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) days wear doublebreasted
suits, would--being something of an engineer--always be gratified by large
dazzling vehicles, would--though a German and at this point in history a German of
some influence-- always be the sort of man with whom a Polish chauffeur could safely
crack a lame, comradely joke.
But it will not be possible to see the whole story under such easy character headings. For
this is the story of the pragmatic triumph of good over evil, a triumph in eminently
measurable, statistical, unsubtle terms. When you work from the other end of the beast--
when you chronicle the predictable and measurable success evil generally achieves--it is
easy to be wise, wry, piercing, to avoid bathos. It is easy to show the inevitability by
which evil acquires all of what you could call the real estate of the story, even though
good might finish up with a few imponderables like dignity and self-knowledge. Fatal
human malice is the staple of narrators, original sin the mother-fluid of historians. But it
is a risky enterprise to have to write of virtue.
<div class="bookquote">``Virtue''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>in fact is such a dangerous word that we have to rush to explain; Herr Oskar
Schindler, risking his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) glimmering shoes on the icy pavement in this old and elegant
quarter of Cracow, was not a virtuous young man in the customary sense. In this city he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
kept house with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) German mistress and maintained a long affair with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Polish
secretary. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, Emilie, chose to live most of the time at home in Moravia, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>)
sometimes came to Poland to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). There's this to be said for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): that to all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
women he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a well-mannered and generous lover. But under the normal interpretation
of <div class="bookquote">``virtue,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>that's no excuse.
Likewise, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a drinker. Some of the time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drank for the pure glow of it, at other
times with associates, bureaucrats, SS men for more palpable results. Like few others, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was capable of staying canny while drinking, of keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. That again, though--
under the narrow interpretation of morality--has never been an excuse for carousing.
And although Herr Schindler's merit is well documented, it is a feature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) ambiguity
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) worked within or, at least, on the strength of a corrupt and savage scheme, one
that filled Europe with camps of varying but consistent inhumanity and created a
submerged, unspoken-of nation of prisoners. The best thing, therefore, may be to begin
with a tentative instance of Herr Schindler's strange virtue and of the places and
associates to which it brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>).
At the end of Straszewskiego Street, the car moved beneath the black bulk of Wawel
Castle, from which the National Socialist Party's darling lawyer Hans Frank ruled the
Government General of Poland. As from the palace of any evil giant, no light showed.
Neither Herr Schindler nor the driver glanced up at the ramparts as the car turned
southeast toward the river. At the Podg@orze Bridge, the guards, placed above the
freezing Vistula to prevent the transit of partisans and other curfew-breakers between
Podg@orze and Cracow, were used to the vehicle, to Herr Schindler's
face, to the Passierschein presented by the chauffeur. Herr Schindler passed this
checkpoint frequently, traveling either from his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) factory -LRB-where he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) also had an apartment-RRB-
to the city on business, or else from his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) Straszewskiego Street apartment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) plant in
the suburb of Zablocie. They were used to seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) after dark
too, attired formally or semiformally, passing one way or another to a dinner, a party, a
bedroom; perhaps, as was the case tonight, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) way ten kilometers out of town to the
forced-labor camp at P@lasz@ow, to dine there with SS Hauptsturmf@uhrer Amon
Goeth, that highly placed sensualist. Herr Schindler had a reputation for being generous
with gifts of liquor at Christmas, and so the car was permitted to pass over into the suburb
of Podg@orze without much delay.
It is certain that by this stage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) history, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) liking for good food and wine,
Herr Schindler approached tonight's dinner at Commandant Goeth's more with loathing
than with anticipation. There had in fact never been a time when to sit and drink with
Amon had not been a repellent business. Yet the revulsion Herr Schindler felt was of a
piquant kind, an ancient, exultant sense of abomination--of the same sort as, in a
medieval painting, the just show for the damned. An emotion, that is, which stung Oskar
rather than unmanned him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). In the black leather interior of the Adler as it raced along the
trolley tracks in what had been until recently the Jewish ghetto, Herr Schindler--as
always--chain-smoked. But it was composed chain smoking. There was never tension in
the hands; he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was stylish. His (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) manner implied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) knew where the next cigarette was
coming from and the next bottle of cognac. Only he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) could have told us whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had to
succor himself from a flask as he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) passed by the mute, black village of Prokocim and saw,
on the line to Lw@ow, a string of stalled cattle cars, which might hold infantry or
prisoners or even--though the odds were against it--cattle.
Out in the countryside, perhaps ten kilometers from the center of town, the Adler turned
right at a street named--by an irony--Jerozolimska. This night of sharp frosty outlines,
Herr Schindler saw beneath the hill first a ruined synagogue, and then the bare shapes of
what passed these days as the city of Jerusalem, Forced Labor Camp P@lasz@ow,
barracks town of 20,000 unquiet Jews. The Ukrainian and Waffen SS men at the gate
greeted Herr Schindler courteously, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was known at least as well here as on the
Podg@orze Bridge.

<p/>When level with the Administration Building, the Adler moved onto a prison road paved
with Jewish gravestones. The campsite had been till two years before a Jewish cemetery.
Commandant Goeth, who claimed to be a poet, had used in the construction of his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) camp
whatever metaphors were to hand. This metaphor of shattered gravestones ran the length
of the camp, splitting it in two, but did not extend eastward to the villa occupied by
Commandant Goeth himself. On the right, past the guard barracks, stood a former Jewish
mortuary building. It seemed to declare that here all death was natural and by attrition,
that all the dead were laid out. In fact the place was now used as the Commandant's
stables. Though Herr Schindler was used to the sight, it is possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) still reacted
with a small ironic cough. Admittedly, if you reacted to every little irony of the new
Europe, you took it into you, it became part of your baggage. But Herr Schindler
possessed an immense capacity for carrying that sort of luggage.
A prisoner named Poldek Pfefferberg was also on his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) way to the Commandant's villa that
evening. Lisiek, the Commandant's nineteen-year-old orderly, had come to Pfefferberg's
barracks with passes signed by an SS NCO. The boy's problem was that the
Commandant's bathtub had a stubborn ring around it, and Lisiek feared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) would be
beaten for it when Commandant Goeth came to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) morning bath. Pfefferberg, who
had been Lisiek's teacher in high school in Podg@orze, worked in the camp garage and
had access to solvents. So in company with Lisiek he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) went to the garage and picked up a
stick with a swab on the end and a can of cleaning fluid. To approach the Commandant's
villa was always a dubious business, but involved the chance that you would be given
food by Helen Hirsch, Goeth's mistreated Jewish maid, a generous girl who had also
been a student of Pfefferberg's.
When Herr Schindler's Adler was still 100 meters from the villa, it set the dogs
barking--the Great Dane, the wolfhound and all the others Amon kept in the kennels
beyond the house. The villa itself was square-built, with an attic. The upper windows
gave onto a balcony. All around the walls was a terraced patio with a balustrade. Amon
Goeth liked sitting out of doors in the summer. Since he (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>)'d come to P@lasz@ow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>)'d put
on weight. Next summer he (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>)'d make a fat sun-worshiper. But in this particular version of
Jerusalem, he (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>)'d be safe from mockery.
An SS Unterscharf@uhrer -LRB-sergeant-RRB- in white gloves had been put on the door tonight.
Saluting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) admitted Herr Schindler to the house. In the hallway, the Ukrainian orderly
Ivan took Herr Schindler's coat and homburg. Schindler patted the breast pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
suit to be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had the gift for his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) host: a gold-plated cigarette case, black-market.
Amon was doing so well on the side, especially with confiscated jewelry, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would
be offended by anything less than gold plate.
At the double doors opening onto the dining room, the Rosner brothers were playing,
Henry on violin, Leo on accordion. At Goeth's demand, they had put aside the tattered
clothing of the camp paint shop where they worked in the daytime and adopted the
evening clothes they kept in their barracks for such events. Oskar Schindler knew that
although the Commandant admired their music, the Rosners never played at ease in the
villa. They had seen too much of Amon. They knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was erratic and given to ex
tempore executions. They played studiously and hoped that their music would not
suddenly, inexplicably, give offense.
At Goeth's table that night there would be seven men. Apart from Schindler himself and
the host, the guests included Julian Scherner, head of the SS for the Cracow region, and
Rolf Czurda, chief of the Cracow branch of the SD, the late Heydrich's Security Service.
Scherner was an Oberf@uhrer--an SS rank between colonel and brigadier general, for
which there is no army equivalent; Czurda, an Obersturmbannf@uhrer, equivalent to
lieutenant colonel. Goeth himself held the rank of Hauptsturmf@uhrer, or captain.
Scherner and Czurda were the guests of highest honor, for this camp was under their
authority. They were years older than Commandant Goeth, and SS police chief Scherner
looked definitely middle-aged with his (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) glasses and bald head and slight obesity. Even so,
in view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) prot@eg`e's profligate living habits, the age difference between himself
and Amon didn't seem so great.
The oldest of the company was Herr Franz Bosch, a veteran of the first war, manager of
various workshops, legal and illegal, inside P@lasz@ow. He (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) was also an <div class="bookquote">``economic
adviser''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>to Julian Scherner and had business interests in the city.
Oskar despised Bosch and the two police chiefs, Scherner and Czurda. Their cooperation,
however, was essential to the existence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) own peculiar plant in Zablocie, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>)
regularly sent them gifts. The only guests with whom Oskar shared any fellow feeling
were Julius Madritsch, owner of the Madritsch uniform factory inside this camp of
P@lasz@ow, and Madritsch's manager, Raimund Titsch. Madritsch was a year or so
younger than Oskar and Herr Commandant Goeth.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) was an enterprising but humane man, and if asked to justify the existence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>)
profitable factory inside the camp, would have argued that it kept nearly four thousand
prisoners employed and therefore safe from the death mills. Raimund Titsch, a man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
early forties, slight and private and likely to leave the party early, was Madritsch's
manager, smuggled in truckloads of food for his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) prisoners -LRB-an enterprise that could have
earned him (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) a fatal stay in Montelupich prison, the SS jail, or else Auschwitz-RRB- and agreed
with Madritsch. Such was the regular roster of dinner companions at Herr Commandant
Goeth's villa.

<p/>The four women guests, their hair elaborately coiffed and their gowns expensive, were
younger than any of the men. They were better-class whores, German and Polish, from
Cracow. Some of them were regular dinner guests here. Their number permitted a range
of gentlemanly choice for the two field-grade officers. Goeth's German mistress, Majola,
usually stayed at her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) apartment in the city during these feasts of Amon's. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) looked on
Goeth's dinners as male occasions and thus offensive to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) sensibilities.
There is no doubt that in their fashion the police chiefs and the Commandant liked Oskar.
There was, however, something odd about him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). They might have been willing to write it
off in part as stemming from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) origins. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was Sudeten German --Arkansas to their
Manhattan, Liverpool to their Cambridge. There were signs that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wasn't right-minded,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) paid well, was a good source of scarce commodities, could hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) liquor and
had a slow and sometimes rowdy sense of humor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was the sort of man you smiled and
nodded at across the room, but it was not necessary or even wise to jump up and make a
fuss over him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). It is most likely that the SS men noticed Oskar Schindler's entrance
because of a frisson among the four girls. Those who knew Oskar in those years speak of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) easy magnetic charm, exercised particularly over women, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was
unremittingly and improperly successful. The two police chiefs, Czurda and Scherner,
now probably paid attention to Herr Schindler as a means of keeping the attention of the
women. Goeth also came forward to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) hand. The Commandant was as tall as
Schindler, and the impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was abnormally fat for a man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) early thirties
was enhanced by this height, an athletic height onto which the obesity seemed
unnaturally grafted. The face seemed scarcely flawed at all, except that there was a
vinous light in the eyes. The Commandant drank indecent quantities of the local brandy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) was not, however, as far gone as Herr Bosch, P@lasz@ow's and the SS' economic
genius. Herr Bosch was purple-nosed; the oxygen which by rights belonged to the veins
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) face had for years gone to feed the sharp blue flame of all that liquor. Schindler,
nodding to the man, knew that tonight Bosch would, as usual, put in an order for goods.
<div class="bookquote">``A welcome to our industrialist,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>boomed Goeth, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) made a formal introduction
to the girls around the room. The Rosner brothers played Strauss melodies through this,
Henry's eyes wandering only between his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) strings and the emptiest corner of the room,
Leo smiling down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Leo</b></font>) accordion keys.
Herr Schindler was now introduced to the women. While Herr Schindler kissed the
proffered hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) felt some pity for these Cracow working girls, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) knew that
later--when the slap-and-tickle began--the slap might leave welts and the tickle gouge
the flesh. But for the present, Hauptsturmf@uhrer Amon Goeth, a sadist when drunk, was
an exemplary Viennese gentleman.
The predinner conversation was unexceptional. There was talk of the war, and while SD
chief Czurda took it upon himself to assure a tall German girl that the Crimea was
securely held, SS chief Scherner informed one of the other women that a boy he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew
from Hamburg days, a decent chap, Oberscharf@uhrer in the
SS, had had his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) legs blown off when the partisans bombed a restaurant in Czestochowa.
Schindler talked factory business with Madritsch and his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) manager Titsch. There was a
genuine friendship between these three entrepreneurs. Herr Schindler knew that little
Titsch procured illegal quantities of black-market bread for the prisoners of the Madritsch
uniform factory, and that much of the money for the purpose was put up by Madritsch.
This was the merest humanity, since the profits in Poland were large enough, in Herr
Schindler's opinion, to satisfy the most inveterate capitalist and justify some illegal
outlay for extra bread. In Schindler's case, the contracts of the Rustungsinspektion, the
Armaments Inspectorate--the body that solicited bids and awarded contracts for the
manufacture of every commodity the German forces needed--had been so rich that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
had exceeded his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) desire to be successful in the eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) father. Unhappily, Madritsch
and Titsch and he (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>), Oskar Schindler, were the only ones he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) knew who regularly spent
money on black-market bread.

<p/>Near the time when Goeth would call them to the dinner table, Herr Bosch approached
Schindler, predictably took him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) by the elbow and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) over by the door where the
musicians played, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) expected the Rosners' impeccable melodies to cover the
conversation. <div class="bookquote">``Business good, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bosch/Herr Bosch</b></font>)</div>said Bosch.
Schindler smiled at the man. <div class="bookquote">``You see that, do you, Herr Bosch?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bosch/Herr Bosch</b></font>)</div>said Bosch. And of course Bosch would have read the official bulletins of the
Main Armaments Board, announcing contracts awarded to the Schindler factory.
<div class="bookquote">``I was wondering,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bosch/Herr Bosch</b></font>)</div>said Bosch, inclining his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``if in view of the present boom,
founded, after all, on our general successes on a series of Fronts ... I was wondering if
you might wish to make a generous gesture. Nothing big. Just a gesture.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bosch/Herr Bosch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Schindler. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) felt the nausea that goes with being used, and at the same
time a sensation close to joy. The office of police chief Scherner had twice used its
influence to get Oskar Schindler out of jail. His (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) staff were willing now to build up the
obligation of having to do it again.
<div class="bookquote">``My aunt in Bremen's been bombed out, poor old dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bosch/Herr Bosch</b></font>)</div>said Bosch. <div class="bookquote">``Everything! The
marriage bed. The sideboards--all her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) Meissen and crockery. I wondered could you spare
some kitchenware for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). And perhaps a pot or two --those big tureen things you turn out
at DEF.''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>Deutsche Emailwaren Fabrik -LRB-german
Enamelware Factory-RRB- was the name of Herr Schindler's booming business. Germans
called it DEF for short, but the Poles and the Jews had a different sort of shorthand,
calling it Emalia.

<p/>Herr Schindler said, <div class="bookquote">``I think that can be managed. Do you want the goods consigned
direct to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) or through you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>Bosch did not even smile. <div class="bookquote">``Through me, Oskar. I'd like to enclose a little card.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So it's settled. We'll say half a gross of everything--soup bowls, plates, coffee mugs.
And half a dozen of those stewpots.''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>Herr Schindler, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) jaw, laughed frankly,
though with weariness. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) sounded complaisant. As indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was always reckless with gifts. It was simply that Bosch seemed to suffer constantly
from bombed-out kinfolk.
Oskar murmured, <div class="bookquote">``Does your aunt run an orphanage?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Bosch looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) in the eye again; nothing furtive about this drunk. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)'s an old
woman with no resources. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) can barter what she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) doesn't need.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell my secretary to see to it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That Polish girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bosch/Herr Bosch</b></font>)</div>said Bosch. <div class="bookquote">``The looker?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The looker,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>Schindler agreed.
Bosch tried to whistle, but the tension of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) lips had been destroyed by the overproof
brandy and the sound emerged as a low raspberry. <div class="bookquote">``Your wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) said, man to man,
<div class="bookquote">``must be a saint.''
 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>Herr Schindler admitted curtly. Bosch was welcome to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) kitchenware, but
Schindler didn't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) talking about his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) wife.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bosch/Herr Bosch</b></font>)</div>said Bosch. <div class="bookquote">``How do you keep her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) off your back? She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must know ... yet you
seem to be able to control her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) very well.''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>All the humor left Schindler's face now.
Anyone could have seen frank distaste there. The small potent growl that arose from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>),
however, was not unlike Schindler's normal voice.
<div class="bookquote">``I never discuss private matters,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) said.
Bosch rushed in. <div class="bookquote">``Forgive me. I didn't
...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) went on incoherently begging pardon. Herr Schindler did not like Herr Bosch
enough to explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) at this advanced night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) life that it wasn't a matter of
controlling anyone, that the Schindler marital disaster was instead a case of an ascetic
temperament--Frau Emilie Schindler's--and a hedonistic temperament--Herr Oskar
Schindler's--willingly and against good advice binding themselves together. But Oskar's
anger at Bosch was more profound than even he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) would have admitted. Emilie was very
like Oskar's late mother, Frau Louisa Schindler. Herr Schindler senior had left Louisa in
1935. So Oskar had a visceral feeling that in making light of the Emilie-Oskar marriage,
Bosch was also demeaning the marriage of the Schindlers senior. The man was still
rushing out apologies. Bosch, a hand in every till in Cracow, was now in a sweating panic
at the chance of losing six dozen sets of kitchenware.
The guests were summoned to the table. An onion soup was carried in and served by the
maid. While the guests ate and chatted, the Rosner brothers continued to play, moving in
closer to the diners, but not so close as to impede the movements of the maid or of Ivan
and Petr, Goeth's two Ukrainian orderlies. Herr Schindler, sitting between the tall girl
whom Scherner had appropriated and a sweet-faced, small-boned Pole who spoke
German, saw that both girls watched this maid. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) wore the traditional domestic
uniform, black dress and white apron. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) bore no Jewish star on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) arm, no stripe of
yellow paint on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) back. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was Jewish just the same. What drew the attention of the
other women was the condition of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) face. There was bruising along the jawline, and
you would have thought that Goeth had too much shame to display a servant in that
condition in front of the guests from Cracow. Both the women and Herr Schindler could
see, as well as the injury to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) face, a more alarming purple, not always covered by her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
collar, at the junction where her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) thin neck met her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) shoulder. Not only did Amon Goeth
refuse to leave the girl unexplained in the background, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) chair toward her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),
gesturing at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with a hand, displaying her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to the assembled company. Herr Schindler
had not been at this house for six weeks now, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) informants told him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) the relationship
between Goeth and the girl had taken this twisted path. When with friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) used her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as
a conversation piece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) only when senior officers from beyond the Cracow
region were visiting.
<div class="bookquote">``Ladies and gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) called, mimicking the tones of a mock-drunken cabaret
master of ceremonies, <div class="bookquote">``may I introduce Lena. After five months with me she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) is now
doing well in cuisine and deportment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a cabaret master</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can see from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) face,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the tall girl, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>)'s had a collision with the kitchen
furniture.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the bitch could have another,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Goeth with a genial gurgle. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. Another.
Couldn't you, Lena?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>)'s hard on women,''  (<font color='red'><b>the SS chief</b></font>)</div>the SS chief boasted, winking at his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) tall consort. Scherner's
intention might not have been unkind, since he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) did not refer to Jewish women but to
women in general. It was when Goeth was reminded of Lena's Jewishness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lena</b></font>) took
more punishment, either publicly, in front of dinner guests, or later when the
Commandant's friends had gone home. Scherner, being Goeth's superior, could have
ordered the Commandant to stop beating the girl. But that would have been bad form,
would have soured the friendly parties at Amon's villa. Scherner came here not as a
superior, but as a friend, an associate, a carouser, a savorer of women. Amon was a
strange fellow, but no one could produce parties the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) could.
Next there was herring in sauce, then pork knuckles, superbly cooked and garnished by
Lena. They were drinking a heavy Hungarian red wine with the meat, the Rosner brothers
moved in with a torrid czardas, and the air in the dining room thickened, all the officers
removing their uniform jackets. There was more gossip about war contracts. Madritsch,
the uniform manufacturer, was asked about his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) Tarnow factory. Was it doing as well with
Armaments Inspectorate contracts as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) factory inside P@lasz@ow? Madritsch
referred to Titsch, his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) lean, ascetic manager. Goeth seemed suddenly preoccupied, like a
man who has remembered in the middle of dinner some urgent business detail he (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) should
have cleared up that afternoon and which now calls out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) from the darkness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>)
office.
The girls from Cracow were bored, the small-boned Pole, glossy-lipped, perhaps twenty,
probably eighteen, placing a hand on Herr Schindler's right sleeve. <div class="bookquote">``You're not a
soldier?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``You'd look dashing in uniform.''  (<font color='red'><b>Everyone</b></font>)</div>Everyone began to chuckle--
Madritsch too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>)'d spent a while in uniform in 1940 until released because his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>)
managerial talents were so essential to the war effort. But Herr Schindler was so
influential that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had never been threatened with the Wehrmacht. Madritsch laughed
knowingly. <div class="bookquote">``Did you hear that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oberf@uhrer Scherner asked the table at large. <div class="bookquote">``The
little lady's got a picture of our industrialist as a soldier. Private Schindler, eh? Eating
out of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) own mess kits with a blanket around his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) shoulders. Over in Kharkov.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>In view of Herr Schindler's well-tailored elegance it did make a strange picture, and
Schindler himself laughed at it.
<div class="bookquote">``Happened to ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Bosch/Herr Bosch</b></font>)</div>said Bosch, trying to snap his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) fingers; <div class="bookquote">``happened to ... what's his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) name
up in Warsaw?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bosch/Herr Bosch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Toebbens,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Goeth, reviving without warning. <div class="bookquote">``Happened to Toebbens. Almost.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The SD chief Czurda</b></font>)</div>The SD chief, Czurda, said,
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes. Near thing for Toebbens.''  (<font color='red'><b>Czurda/Rolf Czurda/Rolf</b></font>)</div>Toebbens was a Warsaw industrialist. Bigger than
Schindler, bigger than Madritsch. Quite a success. <div class="bookquote">``Heini,''  (<font color='red'><b>Czurda/Rolf Czurda/Rolf</b></font>)</div>said Czurda -LRB-heini being
Heinrich Himmler-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``went to Warsaw and told the armaments man up there, Get the
fucking Jews out of Toebbens' factory and put Toebbens in the Army and ... and send
him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) to the Front. I mean, the Front! And then Heini told my associate up there, he (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) said,
Go over his (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) books with a microscope!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Himmler/Heinrich Himmler</b></font>)</div>Toebbens was a darling of the Armaments Inspectorate, which had favored him (<font color='blue'><b>Himmler</b></font>) with war
contracts and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Himmler</b></font>) had favored in return with gifts. The Armaments Inspectorate's
protests had managed to save Toebbens, Scherner told the table solemnly, and then
leaned over his (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) plate to wink broadly at Schindler. <div class="bookquote">``Never happen in Cracow, Oskar. We
all love you too much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>All at once, perhaps to indicate the warmth the whole table felt for Herr Schindler the
industrialist, Goeth climbed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) feet and sang a wordless tune in unison with the theme
from Madame Butterfly which the dapper brothers Rosner were working on as
industriously as any artisan in any threatened factory in any threatened ghetto.
By now Pfefferberg and Lisiek, the orderly, were upstairs in Goeth's bathroom,
scrubbing away at the heavy bathtub ring. They could hear the Rosners' music and the
bursts of laughter and conversation. It was coffee time down there, and the battered girl
Lena had brought the tray in to the dinner guests and retreated unmolested back to the
kitchen.
Madritsch and Titsch drank their coffee quickly and excused themselves. Schindler
prepared to do the same. The little Polish girl seemed to protest, but this was the wrong
house for him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>). Anything was permitted at the Goethhaus, but Oskar found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) inside
knowledge of the limits of SS behavior in Poland threw sickening light on every word
you spoke here, every glass you drank, not to mention any proposed sexual exchange.
Even if you took a girl upstairs, you could not forget that Bosch and Scherner and Goeth
were your brothers in pleasure, were--on the stairs or in a bathroom or bedroom--going
through the same motions. Herr Schindler, no monk, would rather .be a monk than have a
woman at chez Goeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) spoke across the girl to Scherner, talking about war news,
Polish bandits, the likelihood of a bad winter. Letting the girl know that Scherner was a
brother and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) would never take a girl from a brother. Saying good night, though, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>)
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on the hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) saw that Goeth, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) shirt sleeves, was disappearing out the
dining-room door, heading for the stairwell, supported by one of the girls who had
flanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) at dinner. Oskar excused himself and caught up with the Commandant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
reached out and laid a hand on Goeth's shoulder. The eyes Goeth turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
struggled for focus. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Going, Oskar?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have to be home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar. At home was Ingrid, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) German mistress.
<div class="bookquote">``You're a bloody stallion,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Goeth.
<div class="bookquote">``Not in your class,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Schindler.
<div class="bookquote">``No, you're right. I'm a frigging
Olympian. We're going ... where're we going?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) head to the girl but
answered the question himself. <div class="bookquote">``We're going to the kitchen to see that Lena's clearing up
properly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``We aren't doing that.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) steered him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) to the stairs. It was
decent of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--the sorority in operation-- to protect the thin, bruised girl in the kitchen.
Schindler watched them--the hulking officer, the slight, supporting girl--staggering
crookedly up the staircase. Goeth looked like a man who would have to sleep at least till
lunchtime, but Oskar knew the Commandant's amazing constitution and the clock that
ran in him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). By 3 A.m. Goeth might even decide to rise and write a letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) father in
Vienna. By seven, after only an hour's sleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d be on the balcony, infantry rifle in
hand, ready to shoot any dilatory prisoners.
When the girl and Goeth reached the first landing, Schindler sidled down the hallway
toward the back of the house.
Pfefferberg and Lisiek heard the Commandant, considerably earlier than they had
expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>), entering the bedroom and mumbling to the girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>)'d brought upstairs. In
silence they picked up their cleaning equipment, crept into the bedroom and tried to slip
out a side door. Still standing and able to see them on their line of escape, Goeth recoiled
at the sight of the cleaning stick, suspecting the two men might be assassins. When Lisiek
stepped forward, however, and began a tremulous report, the Commandant understood
that they were merely prisoners.
<div class="bookquote">``Herr Commandant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lisiek</b></font>)</div>said Lisiek, panting with justified fear, <div class="bookquote">``I wish to report that there
has been a ring in your bathtub. ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lisiek</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>said Amon. <div class="bookquote">``So you called in an expert.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) beckoned to the boy. <div class="bookquote">``Come here,
darling.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lisiek</b></font>)</div>Lisiek edged forward and was struck so savagely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) went sprawling halfway under
the bed. Amon again uttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) invitation, as if it might amuse the girl to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
speaking endearments to prisoners. Young Lisiek rose and tottered toward the
Commandant again for another round. As the boy picked himself up the second time,
Pfefferberg, an experienced prisoner, expected anything--that they'd be marched down
to the garden and summarily shot by Ivan. Instead the Commandant simply raged at them
to leave, which they did at once.
When Pfefferberg heard a few days later that Lisiek was dead, shot by Amon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
presumed it was over the bathroom incident. In fact it was for a different matter alt--
Lisiek's offense had been to harness a horse and buggy for Herr Bosch without first
asking the Commandant's permission. In the kitchen of the villa, the maid, whose real
name was Helen Hirsch -LRB-goeth called her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) Lena out of laziness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) would always say-RRB-,
looked up to see one of the dinner guests in the doorway. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) put down the dish of meat
scraps she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>)'d been holding and stood at attention with a jerky suddenness. <div class="bookquote">``Herr ...''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>)
looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) dinner jacket and sought the word for him (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Herr Direktor, I was just putting
aside the bones for the Herr Commandant's dogs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Please, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Herr Schindler.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't have to report to me, Fraulein Hirsch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) moved around the table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) did not seem to be stalking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) feared his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
intentions. Even though Amon enjoyed beating her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) Jewishness always saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>)
from overt sexual attack. But there were Germans who were not as fastidious on racial
matters as Amon. This one's tone of voice, however, was one to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) was not
accustomed, even from the SS officers and NCO'S who came to the kitchen to complain
about Amon.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you know me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) asked, just like a man --a football star or a violinist--whose
sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>violinist</b></font>) own celebrity has been hurt by a stranger's failure to recognize him (<font color='blue'><b>violinist</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm
Schindler.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Herr Direktor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, I've heard ... and you've been
here before. I remember ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>violinist</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>violinist</b></font>) arm around her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>violinist</b></font>) could surely feel the tensing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) body as he (<font color='blue'><b>violinist</b></font>) touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>)
cheek with his (<font color='blue'><b>violinist</b></font>) lips.
He (<font color='blue'><b>violinist</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``It's not that sort of kiss.
I'm kissing you out of pity, if you must know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) couldn't avoid weeping. Herr Direktor Schindler kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) hard now in the middle
of the forehead, in the manner of Polish farewells in railway stations, a resounding
Eastern European smack of the lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had begun to weep too. <div class="bookquote">``That kiss is
something I bring you from ...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) hand, indicating some honest tribe of men
out in the dark, sleeping in tiered bunks or hiding in forests, people for whom--by
absorbing punishment from Hauptsturmf@uhrer Goeth--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) was in part a buffer.

<p/>Herr Schindler released her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) and reached into his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) side pocket, bringing out a large candy
bar. In its substance it too seemed prewar.
<div class="bookquote">``Keep that somewhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I get extra food here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>), as if it were a matter of pride that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) not assume she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>)
was starving. Food, in fact, was the least of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) worries. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) would not survive
Amon's house, but it wouldn't be for lack of food.
<div class="bookquote">``If you don't want to eat it, trade it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>Herr Schindler told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Or why not build yourself
up?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) stood back and surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Itzhak Stern told me about you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Herr Schindler,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>murmured the girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) head down and wept neatly,
economically for a few seconds. <div class="bookquote">``Herr Schindler, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) likes to beat me in front of those
women. On my first day here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) beat me because I threw out the bones from dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
came down to the basement at midnight and asked me where they were. For his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) dogs, you
understand. That was the first beating. I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) ... I don't know why I said it; I'd
never say it now ... Why are you beating me? He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) said, The reason I'm beating you now is
you asked me why I'm beating you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) head and shrugged, as if reproving herself for talking so much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) didn't
want to say any more; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) couldn't convey the history of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) punishments, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) repeated
experience of the Hauptsturmf@uhrer's fists. Herr Schindler bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) head to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>)
confidingly. <div class="bookquote">``Your circumstances are appalling, Helen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I've accepted it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``One day he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'ll shoot me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>Schindler shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) head, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) thought it was too glib an encouragement to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) to
hope. Suddenly, the good cloth and the pampered flesh of Herr Schindler were a
provocation. <div class="bookquote">``For God's sake, Herr Direktor, I see things. We were up on the roof on
Monday, chipping off the ice, young Lisiek and I. And we saw the Herr Commandant
come out of the front door and down the steps by the patio, right below us. And there on
the steps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) gun and shot a woman who was passing. A woman carrying a
bundle. Through the throat. Just a woman on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way somewhere. You know. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) didn't
seem fatter or thinner or slower or faster than anyone else. I couldn't guess what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d
done. The more you see of the Herr Commandant, the more you see that there's no set of
rules you can keep to. You can't say to yourself, If I follow these rules, I'll be safe.
...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>Schindler took her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) hand and wrung it for emphasis. <div class="bookquote">``Listen, my dear Fraulein Helen
Hirsch, in spite of all that, it's still better than Majdanek or Auschwitz. If you can keep
your health ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I thought it would be easy to do that in the Commandant's kitchen. When I
was assigned here, from the camp kitchen, the other girls were jealous.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>A pitiful smile
spread on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) lips.
Schindler raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) voice now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was like a man enunciating a principle of physics.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) won't kill you, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) enjoys you too much, my dear Helen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) enjoys you so
much he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) won't even let you wear the Star. He (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) doesn't want anyone to know it's a Jew
he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>)'s enjoying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) shot the woman from the steps because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meant nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was one of a series, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neither offended nor pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>). You understand that. But you
... it's not decent, Helen. But it's life.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Someone</b></font>)</div>Someone else had said that to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>). Leo John, the Commandant's deputy. John was an SS
Untersturmf@uhrer--equivalent to second lieutenant. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) won't kill you,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Leo John/Leo</b></font>)</div>John had said,
<div class="bookquote">``till the end, Lena, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) gets too much of a kick out of you.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Leo John/Leo</b></font>)</div>Coming from John, it
hadn't had the same effect. Herr Schindler had just condemned her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) to a painful survival.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) seemed to understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) was stunned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) murmured encouragement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d try to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) out. Out? she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) asked. Out of the villa, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) explained; into my
factory, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) said. Surely you have heard of my factory. I have an enamelware factory.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) said like a slum child speaking of the Riviera. ``''Schindler's Emalia.<div class="bookquote">''
I've heard of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Schindler</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Keep your health,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) said again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) seemed to know it would be the key. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) seemed to
draw on a knowledge of future intentions--Himmler's, Frank's
--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) said it. <div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) conceded.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) back on him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) and went to a china closet, dragging it forward from the wall,
an exercise of strength which in such a diminished girl amazed Herr Schindler. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
removed a brick from the section of wall the closet had previously covered. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brought
out a wad of money--
<div class="bookquote">``I have a sister in the camp kitchen,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s younger than I am. I want you to
spend this buying her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) back if ever she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s put on the cattle cars. I believe you often find out
about these things beforehand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll make it my business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>Schindler told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), but with ease, not like a solemn promise.
<div class="bookquote">``How much is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Four thousand z@loty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) took it negligently, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nest egg, and shoved it into a side pocket. It was still safer
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) than in a niche behind Amon Goeth's china closet.
So the story of Oskar Schindler is begun perilously, with Gothic Nazis, with SS
hedonism, with a thin and brutalized girl, andwitha figure of the imagination somehow as
popular as the golden-hearted whore: the good German.
On one hand, Oskar has made it his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) business to know the full face of the system, the rabid
face behind the veil of bureaucratic decency. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) knows, that is, earlier than most would
dare know it, what Sonderbehandlung means; that though it says <div class="bookquote">``Special Treatment,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>it
means pyramids of cyanotic corpses in
Bel@zec, Sobibor, Treblinka, and in that complex west of Cracow known to the Poles as
O@swi@ecim-Brzezinka but which will be known to the West by its German name,
Auschwitz-Birkenau.
On the other hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) is a businessman, a dealer by temperament, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) does not openly
spit in the system's eye. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) has already reduced the pyramids, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) does not
know how this year and next they will grow in size and number and overtop the
Matterhorn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) knows the mountain is coming. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) cannot predict what
bureaucratic shifts will occur in its construction, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) still presumes there will always be
room and need for Jewish labor. Therefore, during his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) visit
to Helen Hirsch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) insists, <div class="bookquote">``Keep your health.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) is sure, and out in the darkened
Arbeitslager -LRB-work camp-RRB- of P@lasz@ow, wakeful Jews stir and promise themselves,
that no regime--the tide set against it--can afford to do away with a plentiful source of
free labor. It's the ones who break down, spit blood, fall to dysentery who are put on the
Auschwitz transports. Herr Schindler himself has heard prisoners, out on the Appellplatz
of the P@lasz@ow labor camp, summoned for morning roll call, murmur, <div class="bookquote">``At least I still
have my health,''  (<font color='red'><b>prisoners</b></font>)</div>in a tone which in normal life only the aged use.

<p/>So, this winter night, it is both early days and late days for Herr Schindler's practical
engagement in the salvage of certain human lives. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) is in deep; he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) has broken Reich
laws to an extent that would earn him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) a multiplicity of hangings, beheadings,
consignments to the drafty huts of Auschwitz or Gr@oss-Rosen. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) does not know
yet how much it will really cost. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) has spent a fortune already, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) does not know
the extent of payments still to be made.
Not to stretch belief so early, the story begins with a quotidian act of kindness--a kiss, a
soft voice, a bar of chocolate. Helen Hirsch would never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) 4,000 zaloty again --not
in a form in which they could be counted and held in the hand. But to this day she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>)
considers it a matter of small importance that Oskar was so inexact with sums of money.

<p/>CHAPTER 1
General Sigmund List's armored divisions, driving north from the Sudetenland, had taken
the sweet south Polish jewel of Cracow from both flanks on September 6, 1939.
And it was in their wake that Oskar Schindler entered the city which, for the next five
years, would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) oyster. Though within the month he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) would show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was
disaffected from National Socialism, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) could still see that Cracow, with its railroad
junction and its as yet modest industries, would be a boomtown of the new regime. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
wasn't going to be a salesman anymore. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was going to be a tycoon.
It is not immediately easy to find in Oskar's family's history the origins of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) impulse
toward rescue. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was born on April 28, 1908, into the Austrian Empire of Franz Josef,
into the hilly Moravian province of that ancient Austrian realm. His (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) hometown was the
industrial city of Zwittau, to which some commercial opening had brought the Schindler
ancestors from Vienna at the beginning of the sixteenth century.
Herr Hans Schindler, Oskar's father, approved of the imperial arrangement, considered
himself culturally an Austrian, and spoke German at the table, on the telephone, in
business, in moments of tenderness. Yet when in 1918 Herr Schindler and the members
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) family found themselves citizens of the Czechoslovak republic of Masaryk and
Bene@s, it did not seem to cause any fundamental distress to the father, and even less
still to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ten-year-old son. The child Hitler, according to the man Hitler, was tormented
even as a boy by the gulf between the mystical unity of Austria and Germany and their
political separation. No such
neurosis of disinheritance soured Oskar Schindler's childhood. Czechoslovakia was such
a bosky, unravished little dumpling of a republic that the German-speakers took their
minority stature with some grace, even if the Depression and some minor governmental
follies would later put a certain strain on the relationship.

<p/>Zwittau, Oskar's hometown, was a small, coal-dusted city in the southern reaches of the
mountain range known as the Jeseniks. Its surrounding hills stood partly ravaged by
industry and partly forested with larch and spruce and fir. Because of its community of
German-speaking Sudetendeutschen, it maintained a German
grammar school, which Oskar attended. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) took the Realgymnasium Course which
was meant to produce engineers--mining, mechanical, civil
--to suit the area's industrial landscape. Herr Schindler himself owned a farm-machinery
plant, and Oskar's education was a preparation for this inheritance. The family Schindler
was Catholic. So too was the family of young Amon Goeth, by this time also completing
the Science Course and sitting for the Matura examinations in Vienna.
Oskar's mother, Louisa, practiced her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) faith with energy, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) clothes redolent all Sunday
of the incense burned in clouds at High Mass in the Church of St. Maurice. Hans
Schindler was the sort of husband who drives a woman to religion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) liked cognac; he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
liked coffeehouses. A redolence of brandy-warm breath, good tobacco, and confirmed
earthiness came from the direction of that good monarchist, Mr. Hans Schindler.
The family lived in a modern villa, set in its own gardens, across the city from the
industrial section. There were two children, Oskar and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) sister, Elfriede. But there are
not witnesses left to the dynamics of that household, except in the most general terms.
We know, for example, that it distressed Frau Schindler that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elfriede</b></font>) son, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) father, was a
negligent Catholic.
But it cannot have been too bitter a household. From the little that Oskar would say of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
childhood, there was no darkness there. Sunlight shines among the
fir trees in the garden. There are ripe plums in the corner of those early summers. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
spends a part of some June morning at Mass, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) does not bring back to the villa much of
a sense of sin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) runs his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) father's car out into the sun in front of the garage and begins
tinkering inside its motor. Or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) sits on a
side step of the house, filing away at the carburetor of the motorcycle he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) is building.
Oskar had a few middle-class Jewish friends, whose parents also sent them to the German
grammar school. These children were not village Ashkenazim--quirky, Yiddishspeaking,
Orthodox--but multilingual and not-so-ritual sons of Jewish businessmen.
Across the Hana Plain and in the Beskidy Hills, Sigmund Freud had been born of just
such a Jewish family, and that not so long before Hans Schindler himself was born to
solid German stock in Zwittau.

<p/>Oskar's later history seems to call out for some set piece in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) childhood. The young
Oskar should defend some bullied Jewish boy on the way home from school. It is a safe
bet it didn't happen, and we are happier not knowing, since the event would seem too pat.
Besides, one Jewish child saved from a bloody nose proves nothing. For Himmler
himself would complain, in a speech to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Himmler</b></font>) Einsatzgruppen, that every German had
a Jewish friend. ``''The Jewish people are going to be annihilated,'' says every Party
member. ``Sure, it's in our program: elimination of the Jews, annihilation--we'll take
care of it.<div class="bookquote">'' And then they all come trudging, eighty million worthy Germans, and each
one has his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) one decent Jew. Sure, the others are swine, but this one is an A-One Jew.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jews</b></font>)</div>Trying still to find, in the shadow of Himmler, some hint of Oskar's later enthusiasms,
we encounter the Schindlers' next-door neighbor, a liberal rabbi named Dr. Felix Kantor.
Rabbi Kantor was a disciple of Abraham Geiger, the German liberalizer of Judaism who
claimed that it was no crime, in fact was praiseworthy, to be a German as well as a Jew.
Rabbi Kantor was no rigid village scholar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kantor</b></font>) dressed in the modern mode and spoke
German in the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kantor</b></font>) called his (<font color='blue'><b>Kantor</b></font>) place of worship a <div class="bookquote">``temple''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and not by that older
name, <div class="bookquote">``synagogue.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Kantor</b></font>) temple was attended by Jewish doctors, engineers, and
proprietors of textile mills in Zwittau. When they traveled, they told other businessmen,
<div class="bookquote">``Our rabbi is Dr. Kantor--he (<font color='blue'><b>Kantor</b></font>) writes articles not only for the Jewish journals in Prague
and Brno, but for the dailies as well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>businessmen</b></font>)</div>Rabbi Kantor's two sons went to the same school as the son of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) German neighbor
Schindler. Both boys were bright enough eventually, perhaps, to become two of the rare
Jewish professors at the German University of Prague. These crew-cut German-speaking
prodigies raced in knee pants around the summer gardens. Chasing the Schindler children
and being chased. And Kantor, watching them flash in and out among the yew hedges,
might have thought it was all working as Geiger and Graetz and Lazarus and all those
other nineteenth-century German-Jewish liberals had predicted. We lead enlightened
lives, we are greeted by German neighbors--
Mr. Schindler will even make snide remarks about Czech statesmen in our hearing. We
are secular scholars as well as sensible interpreters of the Talmud. We belong both to the
twentieth century and to an ancient tribal race. We are neither offensive nor offended
against. Later, in the mid-1930's, the rabbi would revise this happy estimation and make
up his (<font color='blue'><b>rabbi</b></font>) mind in the end that his (<font color='blue'><b>rabbi</b></font>) sons could never buy off the National Socialists with a
German-language Ph.d.
--that there was no outcrop of twentieth-century technology or secular scholarship behind
which a Jew could find sanctuary, any more than there could ever be a species of rabbi
acceptable to the new
German legislators. In 1936 all the Kantors moved to Belgium. The Schindlers never
heard of them again. Race, blood, and soil meant little to the adolescent Oskar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was
one of those boys for whom a motorcycle is the most compelling model of the universe.
And his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) father--a mechanic by temperament--seems to have encouraged the boy's zeal
for red-hot machinery. In the last year of high school, Oskar was riding around Zwittau
on a red 500cc Galloni. A school friend,
Erwin Tragatsch, watched with unspeakable desire as the red Galloni farted its way down
the streets of the town and arrested the attention of promenaders on the square. Like the
Kantor boys, it too was a prodigy--not only the sole Galloni in Zwittau, not only the only
500cc Italian Galloni in Moravia, but probably a unique machine in all Czechoslovakia.

<p/>In the spring of 1928, the last months of Oskar's adolescence and prelude to a summer in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would fall in love and decide to marry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) appeared in the town square on a
250cc Moto-Guzzi, of which there were only four others on the Continent outside Italy,
and those four owned by international racers--Giessler, Hans Winkler, the Hungarian
Joo and the Pole Kolaczkowski. There must have been townspeople who shook their
heads and said that Herr Schindler was spoiling the boy.

<p/>But it would be Oskar's sweetest and most innocent summer. An apolitical boy in a skullfitting
leather helmet revving the motor of the Moto-Guzzi, racing against the local
factory teams in the mountains of Moravia, son of a family for whom the height of
political sophistication was to burn a candle for Franz Josef. Just around the pine-clad
curve, an ambiguous marriage, an economic slump, seventeen years of fatal politics. But
on the rider's face no knowledge, just the wind-flattened grimace of a high-speed biker
who--because he (<font color='blue'><b>biker</b></font>) is new, because he (<font color='blue'><b>biker</b></font>) is no pro, because all his (<font color='blue'><b>biker</b></font>) records are as yet unset--
can afford the price better than the older ones, the pros, the racers with times to beat.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>biker</b></font>) first contest was in May, the mountain race between Brno and Sobeslav. It was highclass
competition, so that at least the expensive toy prosperous Herr Hans Schindler had
given his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) son was not rusting in a garage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) came in third on his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) red Moto-Guzzi,
behind two Terrots which had been souped up with English Blackburne motors.
For his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) next challenge he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) moved farther from home to the Altvater circuit, in the hills on
the Saxon border. The German 250cc champion Walfried Winkler was there for the race,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Winkler</b></font>) veteran rival Kurt Henkelmann, on a water-cooled DKW. All the Saxon
hotshots--Horowitz, Kocher, and Kliwar--had entered; the Terrot-Blackburnes were
back and some Coventry Eagles. There were three Moto-Guzzis, including Oskar
Schindler's, as well as the big guns from the 350cc class and a BMW 500cc team.
It was nearly Oskar's best, most unalloyed day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) kept within touch of the leaders
during the first laps and watched to see what might happen. After an hour, Winkler,
Henkelmann, and Oskar had left the Saxons behind, and the other Moto-Guzzis fell away
with some mechanical flaw. In what Oskar believed was the second-to-last lap he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) passed
Winkler and must have felt, as palpably as the tar itself and the blur of pines, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
imminent career as a factory-team rider, and the travel-obsessed life it would permit him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
to lead.
In what then he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) assumed was the last lap, Oskar passed Henkelmann and both the
DKW'S, crossed the line and slowed. There must have been some deceptive sign from
officials, because the crowd also believed the race was over. By the time Oskar knew it
wasn't--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had made some amateur mistake--Walfried Winkler and Mita Vychodil
had passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Winkler</b></font>), and even the exhausted Henkelmann was able to nudge him (<font color='blue'><b>Winkler</b></font>) out of third
place.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Winkler</b></font>) was feted home. Except for a technicality, he (<font color='blue'><b>Winkler</b></font>)'d beaten Europe's best.

<p/>Tragatsch surmised that the reasons Oskar's career as a motorcycle racer ended there
were economic. It was a fair guess. For that summer, after a courtship of only six weeks,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) hurried into marriage with a farmer's daughter, and so fell out of favor with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) father,
who happened also to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) employer.
The girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) married was from a village to the east of Zwittau in the Hana Plain. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
convent-schooled and had the sort of reserve he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) admired in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) mother. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) widowed
father was no peasant but a gentleman farmer. In the Thirty Years War, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) Austrian
ancestors had survived the recurrent campaigns and famines which had swept that fertile
plain. Three centuries later, in a new era of risk, their daughter entered an ill-advised
marriage with an unformed boy from Zwittau. Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father disapproved of it as deeply as
Oskar's.
Hans didn't like it because he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could see that Oskar had married in the pattern of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>),
Hans's, own uneasy marriage. A sensual husband, a boy with a wild streak, looking too
early in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) life for some sort of peace from a nunlike, gracious, unsophisticated girl.
Oskar had met Emilie at a party in Zwittau. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) was visiting friends from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) village of
Alt-Molstein. Oskar knew the place, of course; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d sold tractors in the area.
When the banns were announced in the parish churches of Zwittau, some people thought
the couple so ill-matched that they began to look for motives other than love. It is
possible that even that summer the Schindler farm-machinery factory was in trouble, for
it was geared to the manufacture of steam-driven tractors of a type already going out of
style with farmers. Oskar was pouring a large part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wages back into the business,
and now--with Emilie--came a dowry of half a million Reichsmarks, an honest and
alleviating lump of capital in anyone's language. The suspicion of the gossips was
unfounded, though, for that summer Oskar was infatuated. And since Emilie's father
would never find grounds to believe the boy would settle down and be a good husband,
only a fraction of the half-million was ever paid. Emilie herself was delighted to escape
stultifying Alt-Molstein by marrying handsome Oskar Schindler. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) father's closest
friend had always been the dull parish priest, and Emilie had grown up pouring the two of
them tea and listening to their naive opinions on politics and theology. If we are still
seeking significant Jewish connections, there had been some in Emilie's girlhood--the
village doctor who treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) grandmother, and Rita, granddaughter of the storekeeper
Reif. During one of his (<font color='blue'><b>storekeeper</b></font>) visits to the farmhouse, the parish priest told Emilie's father that
it was not good on principle for a Catholic child to have a particular friendship with a
Jew.
Out of the almost glandular stubbornness of girlhood, Emilie resisted the priest's edict.
The friendship with Rita Reif would survive till the day in 1942 when local Nazi officials
executed Rita in front of the store. After the marriage, Oskar and Emilie settled in an
apartment in Zwittau. For Oskar, the Thirties must have seemed a mere epilogue to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
glorious mistake on the Altvater circuit in the summer of `28. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) military service
in the Czechoslovak Army and, although it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) the chance to drive a truck, found
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) abhorred the military life --not on pacifist grounds but on grounds of discomfort.
Home again in Zwittau, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) neglected Emilie in the evenings, staying late in caf`es like a
single man, talking to girls neither nunlike nor gracious. The family business went
bankrupt in 1935, and that same year his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father left Frau Louisa Schindler and took an
apartment of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own. Oskar hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) for that and went and drank tea with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) aunts and
denounced Hans to them and, even in caf`es, made speeches about his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) father's treachery
to a good woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) seems to have been blind to the resemblance between his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) own
faltering marriage and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) parents' broken one.

<p/>Because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) good business contacts, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) conviviality, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) gifts of salesmanship, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
ability to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) liquor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) got a job even in the midst of the Depression as sales
manager of Moravian Electrotechnic. Its head office was located in the grim provincial
capital of Brno, and Oskar commuted between Brno and Zwittau. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) liked the traveling
life. It was half the destiny he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d promised himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d passed Winkler on the
Altvater circuit.
When his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) mother died, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) rushed back to Zwittau and stood beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) aunts; his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) sister,
Elfriede; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wife, Emilie, on one side of the grave, while treacherous Hans stood
solitary-- except, of course, for the parish priest--at the head of the coffin. Louisa's
death had consecrated the enmity between Oskar and Hans. Oskar couldn't see it--only
the women could--that Hans and Oskar were in fact two brothers separated by the
accident of paternity.
By the time of that funeral, Oskar was wearing the Hakenkreuz emblem of Konrad
Henlein's Sudeten German Party. Neither Emilie nor the aunts approved, but they did not
take it too hard--it was something young Czech Germans were wearing that season. Only
the Social Democrats and the Communists did not sport the badge or subscribe to
Henlein's Party, and God knew Oskar was neither a Communist nor a Social Democrat.
Oskar was a salesman. All things being equal, when you went in to a German company
manager wearing the badge, you got the order.
Yet even with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) order book wide open and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) pencil flying, Oskar also--in the months
in 1938 before the German divisions entered the Sudetenland--felt a sense of a grand
shift in history, and was seduced by the itch to be party to it. Whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) motives for
running with Henlein, it seems that as soon as the divisions entered Moravia he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) suffered
an instant disillusionment with National Socialism, as thorough and as quick as the
disillusionment that had set in after marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) seems to have expected that the
invading power would allow some brotherly Sudeten Republic to be founded. In a later
statement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was appalled by the new regime's bullying of the Czech population,
by the seizure of Czech property. His (<font color='blue'><b>Czech</b></font>) first documented acts of rebellion would occur very
early in the coming world conflict, and there is no need to doubt that the Protectorate of
Bohemia and Moravia, proclaimed by Hitler from Hradschin Castle in March 1939,
surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Hitler</b></font>) with its early showing of tyranny.
Besides that, the two people whose opinions he (<font color='blue'><b>Hitler</b></font>) most respected--Emilie, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hitler</b></font>)
estranged father--were not taken in by the grand Teutonic hour and both claimed to
know Hitler could not succeed. Their opinions were not sophisticated, but neither were
Oskar's. Emilie believed simply that the man would be punished for making himself
God. Herr Schindler senior, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) position was relayed to Oskar by an aunt, fell back on
basic historical principles. Just outside Brno was the stretch of river where Napoleon had
won the battle of Austerlitz. And what had befallen this triumphant Napoleon? He (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>)'d
become a nobody, growing potatoes on an island in the mid-Atlantic. The same would
happen to this fellow. Destiny, said Herr Schindler senior, was not a limitless rope. It was
a piece of elastic. The harder you went forward, the more fiercely you were jerked back
to your starting point. That was what life, a failed marriage, and the economic slump had
taught Herr Hans Schindler.
But perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) son, Oskar, was not yet a clear enemy of the new system. One evening
that autumn, young Herr Schindler attended a party at a sanitarium in the hills outside
Ostrava, up near the Polish border. The hostess was the sanitarium manager, a client and
friend Oskar had acquired on the road. She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to a personable German
named Eberhard Gebauer. They talked about business and what moves France and
Britain and Russia might make. Then they went off with a bottle to a spare room so that,
as Gebauer suggested, they could talk more frankly. There Gebauer identified himself as
an officer of Admiral Canaris' Abwehr intelligence and offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) new drinking
companion the chance to work for the Foreign Section of the Abwehr. Oskar had
accounts across the border in Poland, throughout Galicia and Upper Silesia. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
agree to supply the Abwehr with military intelligence from that region? Gebauer said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gebauer</b></font>)
knew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gebauer</b></font>) friend the hostess that Oskar was intelligent and gregarious. With these
gifts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could make use not only of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) own observations of industrial and military
installations in the area but of those of any German Poles he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) might happen to recruit in
restaurants or bars, or during business meetings.
Again, apologists for the young Oskar would say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) agreed to work for Canaris
because, as an Abwehr agent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was exempt from army service. That was a large part of
the proposal's charm. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) must also have believed that a German advance into Poland
would be appropriate. Like the slim officer sitting drinking on the bed with him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) must
still have approved of the national business, though he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) did not like the management. For
Oskar, Gebauer may have possessed a moral allure, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gebauer</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gebauer</b></font>) Abwehr colleagues
considered themselves a decent Christian elite. Though it did not prevent their planning
for a military intrusion into Poland, it gave them a contempt for Himmler and the SS,
with whom, they believed high-handedly, they were in competition for the control of
Germany's soul.
Later, a very different intelligence-gathering body would find Oskar's reports to be full
and praiseworthy. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) Polish journeys for the Abwehr, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) showed a gift for charming
news out of people, especially in a social setting--at the dinner table, over cocktails. We
do not know the exact nature or importance of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) found out for Gebauer and
Canaris, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gebauer</b></font>) came to like the city of Cracow very well, and to discover that though it
was no great industrial metropolis, it was an exquisite medieval city surrounded with a
fringe of metal, textile, and chemical plants.
As for the unmotorized Polish Army, its secrets were all too apparent.

<p/>CHAPTER 2
In late October 1939, two young German NCO'S entered the showroom of J. C.
Buchheister and Company in Stradom Street , Cracow, and insisted on buying some
expensive bolts of cloth to send home. The Jewish clerk behind the counter, a yellow star
sewn to his (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) breast, explained that Buchheister's did not sell direct to the public but
supplied garment factories and retail outlets. The soldiers would not be dissuaded. When
it was time to settle their bill, they did it whimsically with a Bavarian banknote of 1858
and a piece of German Army Occupation scrip dated 1914.
<div class="bookquote">``Perfectly good currency,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bookkeeper</b></font>)</div>one of them told the Jewish bookkeeper. They were healthylooking
young men who had spent all spring and summer on maneuvers, the early
autumn yielding them an easy triumph and, later, all the latitude of conquerors in a sweet
city. The bookkeeper agreed to the transaction and got them out of the shop before
ringing up a sale on the cash register. Later in the day, a young German accounts
manager, an official appointed by the deftly named East Trust Agency to take over and
run Jewish businesses, visited the showroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) was one of two German officials
assigned to Buchheister. The first was Sepp Aue, the supervisor, a middle-aged,
unambitious man, and the second, this young go-getter. The young man inspected the
books and the till. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took out the valueless currency. What did it mean, this comic-opera
money?
The Jewish bookkeeper told his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) story; the accounts manager accused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of substituting
the antique notes for hard z@loty. Later in the day, in Buchheister's warehouse upstairs,
the go-getter reported to Sepp Aue and said they should call in the Schutzpolizei.
Herr Aue and the young accountant both knew that such an act would lead to the
imprisonment of the bookkeeper in the SS jail in Montelupich Street. The accountant
thought that this would set an excellent example for Buchheister's remaining Jewish
staff. But the idea distressed Aue, who had a secret liability of his (<font color='blue'><b>accountant</b></font>) own, his (<font color='blue'><b>accountant</b></font>) grandmother
having been Jewish, though no one had yet found that out.
Aue sent an office boy with a message to the company's original accountant, a Polish Jew
named Itzhak Stern, who was at home with influenza. Aue was a political appointee with
little accounting experience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Aue</b></font>) wanted Stern to come into the office and resolve the
impasse over the bolts of linen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) had just sent the message off to Stern's house in
Podg@orze when his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) secretary came into the office and announced that a Herr Oskar
Schindler was waiting outside, claiming to have an appointment. Aue went into the outer
room and saw a tall young man, placid as a large dog, tranquilly smoking. The two had
met at a party the night before. Oskar had been there with a Sudeten German girl named
Ingrid, Treuh@ander, or supervisor, of a Jewish hardware company, just as Aue was
Treuh@ander of Buchheister's. They were a glamorous couple, Oskar and this Ingrid,
frankly in love, stylish, with lots of friends in the Abwehr.
Herr Schindler was looking for a career in Cracow. Textiles? Aue had suggested. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't
just uniforms. The Polish domestic market itself is large enough and inflated enough to
support us all. You're welcome to look Buchheister's over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d urged Oskar, not
knowing how he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) might regret his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) tipsy camaraderie at 2 P.m. the next day.
Schindler could see that Herr Aue had possible second thoughts about his (<font color='blue'><b>Aue</b></font>) invitation. If
it's not convenient, Herr Treuh@ander, Oskar suggested ...
Herr Aue said not at all and took Schindler through the warehouse and across a yard to
the spinning division, where great rolls of golden fabric were running off the machines.
Schindler asked if the Treuh@ander had had trouble with the Poles. No, said Sepp,
they're cooperative.
Stunned, if anything. After all, it's not
exactly a munitions factory.
Schindler so obviously had the air of a man with connections that Aue could not resist the
temptation to test the point. Did Oskar know the people at the Main Armaments Board?
Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) know General Julius Schindler, for example. Perhaps General Schindler was a
relative.
That makes no difference, said Herr Schindler disarmingly. -LRB-in fact General Schindler
was unrelated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>).-RRB- The General wasn't such a bad fellow, compared with some, said
Oskar. Aue agreed. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) himself would never dine with General Schindler or meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
for drinks; that was the difference.
They returned to the office, encountering on the
way Itzhak Stern, Buchheister's Jewish
accountant, waiting on a chair provided
by Aue's secretary, blowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Aue</b></font>) nose and coughing harshly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Aue</b></font>) stood up, joined his (<font color='blue'><b>Aue</b></font>) hands
one on top of the other in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Aue</b></font>) chest, and with immense eyes watched both
conquerors approach, pass him (<font color='blue'><b>Aue</b></font>), and enter the office. There Aue offered Schindler a drink
and then, excusing himself, left Oskar by the fire and went out to interview Stern. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>)
was so thin, and there was a scholarly dryness to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) had the manners of a Talmudic
scholar, but also of a European intellectual. Aue told him (<font color='blue'><b>Aue</b></font>) the story of the bookkeeper and
the NCO'S and the assumptions the young German accountant had made. He (<font color='blue'><b>accountant</b></font>) produced
from the safe the currency: the 1858 Bavarian, the 1914 Occupation. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you
might have instituted an accounting procedure to deal with just this situation,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Aue.
<div class="bookquote">``It must be happening a great deal in Cracow just now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stern/Itzhak Stern/Itzhak</b></font>)</div>Itzhak Stern took the notes and studied them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) had indeed developed a procedure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>)
told the Herr Treuh@ander. Without a smile or a wink, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) moved to the open fire at the
end of the room and dropped both notes into it.
``I write these transactions off to profit and loss, under ``free samples,'''' he (<font color='blue'><b>Buchheister</b></font>) said. There
had been a lot of free samples since September. Aue liked Stern's dry, effective style
with the legal evidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) began to laugh, seeing in the accountant's lean features the
complexities of Cracow itself, the parochial canniness of a small city. Only a local knew
the ropes.

<p/>In the inner office Herr Schindler sat in need of local information. Aue led Stern through
into the manager's office to meet Herr Schindler, who stood staring at the
fire, an unstoppered hip flask held absently in one hand. The first thing Itzhak Stern
thought was, This isn't a manageable German. Aue wore the badge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Aue</b></font>)
F@uhrer, a miniature Hakenkreuz, as negligently as a man might wear the badge of a
cycling club. But big Schindler's coin-sized emblem took the light from the fire in its
black enamel. It, and the young man's general affluence, were all the more the symbols
of Stern's autumn griefs as a Polish Jew with a cold. Aue made the introductions.
According to the edict already issued by Governor Frank, Stern made his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) statement: <div class="bookquote">``I
have to tell you, sir, that I am a Jew.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stern/Itzhak Stern/Itzhak</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>Herr Schindler growled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm a German. So there we are!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stern/Itzhak Stern/Itzhak</b></font>)</div>All very well, Stern almost intoned privately behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) sodden handkerchief. In that
case, lift the edict.
For Itzhak Stern was a man--even now, in only the seventh week of the New Order in
Poland--not under one edict but already under many.
Hans Frank, Governor General of Poland, had already initiated and signed six restrictive
edicts, leaving others to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) district governor, Dr. Otto W@achter, an SS
Gruppenf@uhrer -LRB-equivalent to major general-RRB-, to implement. Stern, besides declaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>)
origins, had also to carry a distinctive registration card marked by a yellow stripe. The
Orders-in-Council forbidding kosher preparation of meats and commanding forced labor
for Jews were three weeks old when Stern stood coughing in Schindler's presence. And
Stern's official ration as an Untermensch -LRB-subhuman-RRB- was little more than half that of a
non-Jewish Pole, the latter being tainted by Untermensch'-hood himself.
Finally, by an edict of November 8, a general registration of all Cracovian Jews had
begun and was required to be completed by the 24th
.
Stern, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) calm and abstract cast of mind, knew that the edicts would continue,
would circumscribe his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) living and breathing further still. Most Cracow Jews expected
such a rash of edicts. There would be some disruption of life--
Jews from the shtetls being brought to town to shovel coal, intellectuals being sent into
the countryside to hoe beets. There would also be sporadic slaughters for a time, like the
one over at Tursk where an SS artillery unit had kept people working on a bridge all day
and then driven them into the village synagogue in the evening and shot them. There
would always be such intermittent instances. But the situation would settle; the race
would survive by petitioning, by buying off the authorities--it was the old method, it had
been working since the Roman Empire, it would work again. In the end the civil
authorities needed Jews, especially in a nation where they were one in every eleven.
Stern, however, wasn't one of the sanguine ones. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) didn't presume that the legislation
would soon achieve a plateau of negotiable severity. For these were the worst of times.
So though he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) did not know that the coming fire would be different in substance as well as
degree, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) was already resentful enough of the future to think, All very well for you, Herr
Schindler, to make generous little gestures of equality.
This man, said Aue, introducing Itzhak
Stern, was Buchheister's right-hand man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) had good connections in the business
community here in Cracow.
It was not Stern's place to argue with Aue about that. Even so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) wondered if the
Treuh@ander wasn't gilding the lily for the distinguished visitor.
Aue excused himself.
Left alone with Stern, Schindler murmured that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d be grateful if the accountant could
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) knew about some of the local businesses. Testing Oskar, Stern
suggested that perhaps Herr Schindler should speak to the officials of the Trust Agency.
<div class="bookquote">``They're thieves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Herr Schindler genially. <div class="bookquote">``They're bureaucrats too. I would like
some latitude.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``I am a capitalist by temperament and I don't like being
regulated.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stern/Itzhak Stern/Itzhak</b></font>)</div>So Stern and the self-declared capitalist began to talk. And Stern was quite a source; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>)
seemed to have friends or relatives in every factory in Cracow--textiles, garments,
confectionery, cabinetmaking, metalwork. Herr Schindler was impressed and took an
envelope from the breast pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) suit. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know a company called Rekord?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
asked.
Itzhak Stern did. It was in bankruptcy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) said. It had made enamelware. Since it had
gone bankrupt some of the metal-press machinery had been confiscated, and now it was
largely a shell, producing--under the management of one of the former owners'
relatives--a mere fraction of its capacity. His (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) own brother, said Stern, represented a
Swiss company that was one of Rekord's major creditors. Stern knew that it was
permitted to reveal a small degree of fraternal pride and then to deprecate it. <div class="bookquote">``The place
was very badly managed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stern/Itzhak Stern/Itzhak</b></font>)</div>said Stern.
Schindler dropped the envelope into Stern's lap. <div class="bookquote">``This is their balance sheet. Tell me
what you think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stern/Itzhak Stern/Itzhak</b></font>)</div>Itzhak said that Herr Schindler should of course ask others as well as himself. Of course,
Oskar told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). But I would value your opinion. Stern read the balance sheets quickly;
then, after some three minutes of study, all at once felt the strange silence of the office
and looked up, finding Herr Oskar Schindler's eyes full on him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>).
There was, of course, in men like Stern an ancestral gift for sniffing out the just Goy, who
could be used as buffer or partial refuge against the savageries of the others. It was a
sense for where a safe house might be, a potential zone of shelter. And from now on the
possibility of Herr Schindler as sanctuary would color the conversation as might a halfglimpsed,
intangible sexual promise color the talk between a man and a woman at a
party. It was a suggestion Stern was more aware of than Schindler, and nothing explicit
would be said for fear of damaging the tender connection.
<div class="bookquote">``It's a perfectly good business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stern/Itzhak Stern/Itzhak</b></font>)</div>said
Stern. <div class="bookquote">``You could speak to my brother. And, of course, now there's the possibility of
military contracts. ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>murmured Herr Schindler.
For almost instantly after the fall of Cracow, even before Warsaw's siege ended, an
Armaments Inspectorate had been set up in the Government General of Poland, its
mandate being to enter into contracts with suitable manufacturers for the supply of army
equipment. In a plant like Rekord, mess kits and field kitchenware could be turned out.
The Armaments Inspectorate, Stern knew, was headed by a Major General Julius
Schindler of the Wehrmacht. Was the
general a relative of Herr Oskar Schindler's? Stern asked. No, I'm afraid not, said
Schindler, but as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) wanted Stern to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) nonrelationship a secret.

<p/>In any case, said Stern, even the skeleton production at Rekord was grossing more than a
half-million z@loty a year, and new metal-pressing plant and furnaces could be acquired
relatively easily. It depended on Herr Schindler's access to credit.

<p/>Enamelware, said Schindler, was closer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) line than textiles. His (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) background was in
farm machinery, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) understood steam presses and so forth.
It did not any longer occur to Stern to ask why an elegant German entrepreneur wished to
talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) about business options. Meetings like this one had occurred throughout the
history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) tribe, and the normal exchanges of business did not quite explain them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>)
talked on at some length, explaining how the Commercial Court would set the fee for the
leasing of the bankrupt estate. Leasing with an option to buy--it was better than being a
Treuh@ander. As a Treuh@ander, only a supervisor, you were completely under the
control of the Economics Ministry.
Stern lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) voice then and risked saying it:
<div class="bookquote">``You will find you are restricted in the people you'll be allowed to employ. ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stern/Itzhak Stern/Itzhak</b></font>)</div>Schindler was amused. <div class="bookquote">``How do you know all this?
About ultimate intentions?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I read it in a copy of the Berliner Tageblatt. A Jew is still permitted to read German
newspapers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>Schindler continued to laugh, reached out a hand, and let it fall on Stern's shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Is
that so?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) asked.
In fact, Stern knew these things because Aue had received a directive from Reich
Secretary of State Eberhard von Jagwitz of the Economics Ministry outlining the policies
to be adopted in Aryanizing businesses. Aue had left it to Stern to make a digest of the
memorandum. Von Jagwitz had indicated, more in sadness than in anger, that there
would be pressure from other government and Party agencies, such as Heydrich's RHSA,
the Reich Security Main Office, to Aryanize not just the ownership of companies, but
also the management and work force. The sooner Treuh@anders filtered out the skilled
Jewish employees the better--always, of course, bearing in mind the maintenance of
production at an acceptable level.
At last Herr Schindler put the accounts of Rekord back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) breast pocket, stood up,
and led Itzhak Stern out into the main office. They stood there for a time, among the
typists and clerks, growing philosophical, as Oskar liked to do. It was here that Oskar
brought up the matter of Christianity's having its base in Judaism, a subject which for
some reason, perhaps even because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) boyhood friendship with the Kantors in
Zwittau, interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). Stern spoke softly, at length, learnedly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) had published articles
in journals of comparative religion. Oskar, who wrongly fancied himself a philosopher,
had found an expert. The scholar himself, Stern, whom some thought a pedant, found
Oskar's understanding shallow, a mind genial by nature but without much conceptual
deftness. Not that Stern was about to complain. An ill-assorted friendship was firmly
established. So that Stern found himself drawing an analogy, as Oskar's own father had,
from previous empires and giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) own reasons why Adolf Hitler could not succeed.
The opinion slipped out before Stern could withdraw it. The other Jews in the office
bowed their heads and stared fixedly at their worksheets. Schindler did not seem
disturbed.
Near the end of their talk, Oskar did say something that had novelty. In times like these,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said, it must be hard for the churches to go on telling people that their Heavenly Father
cared about the death of even a single sparrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'d hate to be a priest, Herr Schindler
said, in an era like this, when life did not have the value of a pack of cigarettes. Stern
agreed but suggested, in the spirit of the discussion, that the Biblical reference Herr
Schindler had made could be summed up by a Talmudic verse which said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) who
saves the life of one man saves the entire world.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar
Schindler.
Itzhak, rightly or wrongly, always believed that it was at that moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had
dropped the right seed in the furrow.

<p/>CHAPTER 3
There is another Cracow Jew who gives an account of meeting Schindler that autumn--
and of coming close to killing him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>). This man's name was Leopold -LRB-poldek-RRB- Pfefferberg.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) had been a company commander in the Polish Army during the recent tragic
campaign. After suffering a leg wound during the battle for the river San, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>)'d limped
around the Polish hospital in Przemy@sl, helping with the other wounded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) was no
doctor, but a high school physical-education teacher who had graduated from the
Jagiellonian University of Cracow and so had some knowledge of anatomy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) was
resilient; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) was self-confident, twenty-seven years old, and built like a wedge.
With some hundreds of other captured Polish officers from Przemy@sl, Pfefferberg was
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) way to Germany when his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) train drew into his (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) home city of Cracow and the
prisoners were herded into the first-class waiting room, to remain there until new
transport could be provided. His (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) home was ten blocks away. To a practical young man, it
seemed outrageous that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) could not go out into Pawia Street and catch a No. 1 trolley
home. The bucolic-looking Wehrmacht guard at the door seemed a provocation.
Pfefferberg had in his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) breast pocket a document signed by the German hospital authority
of Przemy@sl indicating that he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was free to move about the city with ambulance details
tending to the wounded of both armies. It was spectacularly formal, stamped and signed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) took it out now and, going up to the guard, thrust it at him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you read German?''  (<font color='red'><b>Pfefferberg/Poldek Pfefferberg/Poldek</b></font>)</div>Pfefferberg demanded. This sort of ploy had to be done right,
of course. You had to be young; you had to be persuasive; you had to have retained,
undiminished by summary defeat, a confident bearing of a particularly Polish nature--
something disseminated to the Polish officer corps, even to those rare members of it who
were Jewish, by its plentiful aristocrats.
The man had blinked. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I can read German,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. But after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d taken the
document he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held it like a man who couldn't read at all--held it like a slice of bread.
Pfefferberg explained in German how the document declared his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right to go out and
attend to the ill. All the guard could see was a proliferation of official stamps. Quite a
document. With a wave of the head, he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) indicated the door.
Pfefferberg was the only passenger on the No. 1 trolley that morning. It was not even 6
A.m.. The conductor took his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) fare without a fuss, for in the city there were still many
Polish troops not yet processed by the Wehrmacht. The officers had to register, that was
all. The trolley swung around the Barbakan, through the gate in the ancient wall, down
Floria@nska to the Church of St. Mary, across the central square, and so within five
minutes into Grodzka Street. Nearing his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) parents' apartment at No. 48, as he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) had as a boy
he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) jumped from the car before the air brakes went on and let the momentum of the jump,
enhanced by that of the trolley, bring him (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) up with a soft thud against the doorjamb.
After his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) escape, he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) had lived not too uncomfortably in the apartments of friends, visiting
Grodzka 48 now and then. The Jewish schools opened briefly--they would be closed
again within six weeks--and he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) even returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) teaching job. He (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) was sure the
Gestapo would take some time to come looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) applied for ration
books. He (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) began to dispose of jewelry--as an agent and in his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) own right--on the black
market that operated in Cracow's central square, in the arcades of the Sukiennice and
beneath the two unequal spires of St. Mary's Church. Trade was brisk, among the Poles
themselves but more so for the Polish Jews. Their ration books, full of precancelled
coupons, entitled them to only two-thirds of the meat and half of the butter allowance that
went to Aryan citizens, while all the cocoa and rice coupons were cancelled. And so the
black market which had operated through centuries of occupation and the few decades of
Polish autonomy became the food and income source and the readiest means of resistance
for respectable bourgeois citizens, especially those who, like Leopold Pfefferberg, were
street-wise.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) presumed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) would soon be traveling over the ski routes around Zakopane in the
Tatras, across Slovakia's slender neck into Hungary or Rumania. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) was equipped for
the journey: he (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) had been a member of the Polish national ski team. On one of the high
shelves of the porcelain stove in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) mother's apartment he (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) kept an elegant little .22
pistol--armory both for the proposed escape and in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) was ever trapped inside the
apartment by the Gestapo.
With this pearl-handled semitoy, Pfefferberg came close to killing Oskar Schindler one
chilly day in November. Schindler, in double-breasted suit, Party badge on the lapel,
decided to call on Mrs. Mina Pfefferberg, Poldek's mother, to offer her (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) a commission.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had been given by the Reich housing
authorities a fine modern apartment in
Straszewskiego Street. It had previously
been the property of a Jewish family by the name of Nussbaum. Such allocations were
carried out without any compensation to the previous occupant. On the day Oskar came
calling, Mrs. Mina Pfefferberg herself was worried that it would happen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) apartment
in Grodzka.
A number of Schindler's friends would claim later--though it is not possible to prove
it--that Oskar had gone looking for the dispossessed Nussbaums at their lodgings in
Podg@orze and had given them a sum close to 50,000 z@loty in compensation. With this
sum, it is said, the Nussbaums bought themselves an escape to Yugoslavia. Fifty
thousand z@loty signified substantial dissent; but there would be other similar acts of
dissent by Oskar before Christmas. Some friends would in fact come to say that
generosity was a disease in Oskar, a frantic thing, one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) passions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would tip taxi
drivers twice the fare on the meter. But this has to be said too--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) thought the Reich
housing authorities were unjust and told Stern so, not when the regime got into trouble
but even in that, its sweetest autumn.
In any case, Mrs. Pfefferberg had no idea what the tall, well-tailored German was doing
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) door. He (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) could have been there to ask for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) son, who happened to be in the
kitchen just then. He (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) could have been there to commandeer her (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) apartment, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>)
decorating business, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) antiques, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) French tapestry.
In fact, by the December feast of Hanukkah the German police would, on the orders of
the housing office, get around to the Pfefferbergs, arriving at their door and then ordering
them, shivering in the cold, downstairs onto the pavement of Grodzka. When Mrs.
Pfefferberg asked to go back for a coat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) would be refused; when Mr. Pfefferberg
made for a bureau to get an ancestral gold watch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) would be punched in the jaw. <div class="bookquote">``I
have witnessed terrible things in the past,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermann</b></font>)</div>Hermann G@oring had said; <div class="bookquote">``little chauffeurs
and Gauleiters have profited so much from these transactions that they now have about
half a million.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermann</b></font>)</div>The effect of such easy pickings as Mr. Pfefferberg's gold watch on the
moral fiber of the Party might distress G@oring. But in Poland that year, it was the style
of the Gestapo to be unaccountable for the contents of apartments.
When Schindler first came to the Pfefferbergs' second-floor apartment, however, the
family were still in tenuous occupation. Mrs. Pfefferberg and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) son were talking among
the samples and bolts of fabric and wallpaper when Herr Schindler knocked. Leopold was
not worried. There were two front entrances to the apartment--the business door and the
kitchen door faced each other across a landing. Leopold retreated to the kitchen and
looked through the crack in the door at the visitor. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) saw the formidable size of the man,
the fashionable cut of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) suit. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) mother in the living room. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had the
feeling, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) said, that the man was Gestapo. When you let him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) in at the office door, I can
always slip out through the kitchen. Mrs. Mina Pfefferberg was trembling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) opened
the office door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) was, of course, listening for sounds along the corridor.
Pfefferberg had in fact picked up the pistol and put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) belt and intended to wed the
sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) exit to the sound of Herr Schindler's entry. But it seemed folly to go without
knowing what the German official wanted. There was a chance the man would have to be
killed, and then there would need to be a concerted family flight into Rumania.
If the magnetic drift to the event had drawn Pfefferberg to take out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pistol and fire, the
death, the flight, the reprisals would have been considered unexceptional and appropriate
to the history of the month. Herr Schindler would have been briefly mourned and
summarily avenged. And this would have been, of course, the brisk ending to all Oskar's
potentialities. And back in Zwittau they would have said, <div class="bookquote">``Was it someone's husband?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The voice surprised the Pfefferbergs. It was calm, quiet, suited to the doing of business,
even to the asking of favors. They had got used in past weeks to the tone of decree and
summary expropriation. This man sounded fraternal. That was somehow worse. But it
intrigued you too. Pfefferberg had slipped from the kitchen and concealed himself
behind the double doors of the dining room. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see a sliver of the German. You're
Mrs. Pfefferberg? the German asked. You were recommended to me by Herr Nussbaum.
I have just taken over an apartment in Straszewskiego Street, and I would like to have it
redecorated.
Mina Pfefferberg kept the man at the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) spoke so incoherently that the son took
pity on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) and appeared in the doorway, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) jacket buttoned up over the weapon. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
asked the visitor in and at the same time whispered assurances in Polish to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother.
Now Oskar Schindler gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) name. There was some measuring up, for Schindler could
tell that Pfefferberg had appeared to perform an act of primal protection. Schindler
showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) respect by talking now through the son as through an interpreter.
<div class="bookquote">``My wife is coming up from
Czechoslovakia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I'd like the
place redone in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) style.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) said the
Nussbaums had maintained the place
excellently, but they went in for heavy
furniture and somber colors. Mrs.
Schindler's tastes were livelier--a little French, a little Swedish.
Mrs. Pfefferberg had recovered enough to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) didn't know--it was a busy time
with Christmas coming up. Leopold could tell there might be an instinctive resistance in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) to developing a German clientele; but the Germans might be the only race this season
with enough confidence in the future to go in for interior design. And Mrs. Pfefferberg
needed a good contract--her (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) husband had been removed from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) job and worked now
for a pittance in the housing office of the Gemeinde, the Jewish welfare bureau.
Within two minutes the men were chatting like friends. The pistol in Pfefferberg's belt
had now been relegated to the status of armament for some future, remote emergency.
There was no doubt that Mrs. Pfefferberg was going to do the Schindler apartment, no
expense spared, and when that was settled, Schindler mentioned that Leopold Pfefferberg
might like to come around to the apartment to discuss other business. <div class="bookquote">``There is the
possibility that you can advise me on acquiring local merchandise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>Herr Schindler said.
<div class="bookquote">``For example, your very elegant blue shirt ... I don't know where to begin to look for that
kind of thing myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pfefferberg/Poldek Pfefferberg/Poldek</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) ingenuousness was a ploy, but Pfefferberg appreciated it. <div class="bookquote">``The
stores, as you know, are empty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>murmured Oskar like a hint.
Leopold Pfefferberg was the sort of young man who survived by raising the stakes. <div class="bookquote">``Herr
Schindler, these shirts are extremely expensive, I hope you understand. They cost twentyfive
z@loty each.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) had multiplied the price by five. There was all at once an amused knowingness in
Herr Schindler--not enough, though, to imperil the tenuous friendship or remind
Pfefferberg that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was armed. <div class="bookquote">``I could probably get you some,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pfefferberg/Poldek Pfefferberg/Poldek</b></font>)</div>said Pfefferberg, <div class="bookquote">``if
you give me your size. But I'm afraid my contacts will require money in advance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pfefferberg/Poldek Pfefferberg/Poldek</b></font>)</div>Herr Schindler, still with that knowingness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) eyes, took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) wallet and handed
Pfefferberg 200 Reichsmarks. The sum was flamboyantly too much and even at
Pfefferberg's inflated price would have bought shirts for a dozen tycoons. But
Pfefferberg knew the game and did not blink. <div class="bookquote">``You must give me your measurements,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) said. A week later, Pfefferberg brought a dozen silk shirts to Schindler's apartment on
Straszewskiego Street. There was a pretty German woman in the apartment who was
introduced to Pfefferberg as Treuh@ander of a Cracow hardware business. Then, one
evening, Pfefferberg saw Oskar in the company of a blond and large-eyed Polish beauty.
If there was a Frau Schindler, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not appear even after Mrs. Pfefferberg had
redecorated the place. Pfefferberg himself became one of Schindler's most regular
connections to that market in luxuries-- silk, furnishings, jewelry--which flourished in
the ancient town of Cracow.

<p/>CHAPTER 4
The next time Itzhak Stern met Oskar Schindler was on a morning in early December.
Schindler's application to the Polish Commercial Court of Cracow had already been
filed, yet Oskar had the leisure to visit the offices of Buchheister and, after conferring
with Aue, to stand near Stern's desk in the outer office, clap his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) hands, and announce in a
voice that sounded already tipsy, <div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow, it's going to start. J@ozefa and Izaaka
Streets are going to know all about it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stern</b></font>)</div>There were in Kazimierz a J@ozefa Street and an Izaaka Street. There were in every
ghetto, and Kazimierz was the site of the old ghetto of Cracow, once an island ceded to
the Jewish community by Kazimier the Great, now a near suburb nestled in an elbow of
the Vistula River.
Herr Schindler bent over Stern, and Stern felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) brandy-warm breath and considered this
question:
Did Herr Schindler know something would happen in J@ozefa Street and Izaaka Street?
Or was he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) just brandishing the names? In any case, Stern suffered a nauseating sense of
disappointment. Herr Schindler was whistling up a pogrom, boasting inexactly about it,
as if to put Stern in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) place.
It was December 3. When Oskar said <div class="bookquote">``tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Stern presumed he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) was using the term
not in the sense of December 4, but in the terms in which drunks and prophets always
used it, as something that either would or damn well should happen soon. Only a few of
those who heard, or heard about, Herr Schindler's boozy warning took it literally. Some
packed an overnight bag and moved their families across the river to Podg@orze.
As for Oskar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had passed on hard news at some risk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had got it from at least
two sources, new friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). One, an officer attached to the SS police chief's staff,
was a policeman named Wachtmeister -LRB-sergeant-RRB- Herman Toffel. The other, Dieter
Reeder, belonged to the staff of SD chief Czurda. Both these contacts were characteristic
of the sympathetic officers Oskar always managed to sniff out.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was never good, though, at explaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) motives for speaking to Stern that
December. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) would say later that in the period of the German Occupation of Bohemia
and Moravia he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) had seen enough seizure of Jewish and Czech property, and forcible
removal of Jews and Czechs from those Sudeten areas considered German, to cure him (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) of
any zeal for the New Order. His (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) leaking of the news to Stern, far more than the
unconfirmed Nussbaum story, goes some way toward proving his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) case.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) must have hoped also, as the Jews of Cracow did, that after its initial fury the regime
would relax and let people breathe. If the SS raids and incursions of the next few months
could be mitigated by the leaking of advance information, then perhaps sanity would
reassert itself in the spring. After all, both Oskar and the Jews told themselves, the
Germans were a civilized nation.
The SS invasion of Kazimierz would, however, arouse in Oskar a fundamental disgust--
not one that impinged too directly yet on the level at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) money,
entertained women or dined with friends, but one that would, the clearer the intentions of
the reigning power became, lead, obsess, imperil, and exalt him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). The operation was
meant in part to be a raid for jewelry and furs. There'd be some evictions from houses
and apartments in the wealthier borderland between Cracow and Kazimierz. But beyond
these practical results, that first Aktion was also meant to serve dramatic notice to the
dismayed people of the old Jewish quarter. For that purpose, Reeder told Oskar, a small
detachment of Einsatzgruppe men would drive down Stradom and into Kazimierz in the
same trucks as the boys of the local SS and the Field Police.
Six Einsatzgruppen had come to Poland with the invading army. Their name had subtle
meanings.
<div class="bookquote">``Special-duty groups''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is a close
translation. But the amorphous word Einsatz was
also rich with a nuance--of challenge, of picking up
a gauntlet, of knightliness. These squads were
recruited from Heydrich's
Sicherheitsdienst -LRB-SD; Security
Service-RRB-. They already knew their mandate was broad. Their supreme leader had six
weeks ago told General Wilhelm Keitel that <div class="bookquote">``in the Government General of Poland there
will have to be a tough struggle for national existence which will permit of no legal
restraints.''  (<font color='red'><b>General Wilhelm Keitel</b></font>)</div>In the high rhetoric of their leaders, the Einsatz soldiers knew, a struggle for
national existence meant race warfare, just as Einsatz itself, Special Chivalrous Duty,
meant the hot barrel of a gun.
The Einsatz squad destined for action in
Kazimierz that evening were an elite. They would leave to the pieceworkers of the
Cracow SS the sordid task of searching the tenements for diamond rings and fur-trimmed
coats. They themselves would take part in some more radically symbolic activity to do
with the very instruments of Jewish culture--that is, with the ancient synagogues of
Cracow.
They had for some weeks been waiting to exercise
Einsatz, as had the local SS
Sonderkommandos -LRB-or Special
Squads-RRB-, also assigned to this first Cracow Aktion, and the Security Police of SD chief
Czurda. The Army had negotiated with Heydrich and the higher police chiefs a stay of
operations until Poland passed from military to civil rule. This passage of authority had
now taken place, and throughout the country the Knights of Einsatz and the
Sonderkommandos were unleashed to advance with an appropriate sense of racial history
and professional detachment into the old Judaic ghettos.
At the end of the street where Oskar's apartment stood rose the fortified rock outcrop of
Wawel Castle from which Hans Frank ruled. And if Oskar's Polish future is to be
understood, there is a need to look at the linkage between Frank and the young field
operatives of SS and SD, and then between Frank and the Jews of Cracow.
In the first place, Hans Frank had no direct kingship over these special squads moving
into Kazimierz. Heinrich Himmler's police forces, wherever they worked, would always
be their own lawmakers. As well as resenting their independent power, Frank also
disagreed with them on practical grounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had as refined an abomination of the
Jewish population as anyone in the Party and found the sweet city of Cracow intolerable
because of its manifold Jews. In past weeks he (<font color='blue'><b>Party</b></font>)'d complained when the authorities tried to
use the Government General, and especially Cracow with its railway junction, as a
dumping ground for Jews from the cities of the Wartheland, from @l@od@z and
Poznan. But he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) did not believe the Einsatzgruppen or the Sonderkommandos, using
current methods, could really make a dent in the problem. It was Frank's belief, shared
with Himmler in some stages of <div class="bookquote">``Heini's''  (<font color='red'><b>Himmler/Heinrich Himmler</b></font>)</div>mental vagaries, that there should be a single
vast concentration camp for Jews, that it should at least be the city of Lublin and the
surrounding countryside, or even more desirably, the island of Madagascar.
The Poles themselves had always believed in
Madagascar. In 1937 the Polish Government
had sent a commission to study that high-spined island
so far from the coasts of their European
sensibilities. The French Colonial
Office, to which Madagascar belonged, was willing to make a deal, government to
government, on such a resettlement, for a Madagascar crowded with Europe's Jews
would make a grand export market. The South African Defense Minister, Oswald Pirow,
had acted for a time as negotiator between Hitler and France in the matter of the island.
Therefore Madagascar, as a solution, had an honorable pedigree. Hans Frank had his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
money on it and not on the Einsatzgruppen.
For their sporadic raids and massacres could not
cut down the subhuman population of Eastern
Europe. During the time of the campaign around
Warsaw, the Einsatzgruppen had hung
Jews up in the synagogues of Silesia,
ruptured their systems with water torture, raided their homes on Sabbath evenings or feast
days, cut off their prayer locks, set their prayer shawls afire, stood them against a wall. It
had barely counted. There were many indications from history, Frank proposed, that
threatened races generally outbred the genocides. The phallus was faster than the gun.
What no one knew--neither the parties to the debate, the well-educated Einsatzgruppe
boys in the back of one truck, the not-so-refined SS boys in the back of another, the
evening worshipers in the synagogues, Herr Oskar Schindler on his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) way home to
Straszewskiego to dress for dinner--what none of them knew and many a Party planner
scarce hoped for was that a technological answer would be found--that a disinfectant
chemical compound, Zyklon B, would supplant Madagascar as the solution. There had
been an incident involving Hitler's pet actress and director, Leni Riefenstahl. She (<font color='blue'><b>Riefenstahl</b></font>) had
come to @L@od@z with a roving camera crew soon after the city fell and had seen a
line of Jews--visible Jews, the prayer-locked variety--executed with automatic weapons.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Riefenstahl</b></font>) had gone straight to the F@uhrer, who was staying at Southern Army headquarters,
and made a scene. That was it--the logistics, the weight of numbers, the considerations
of public relations; they made the Einsatz boys look silly. But Madagascar too would
look ridiculous once means were discovered to make substantial inroads into the
subhuman population of Central Europe at fixed sites with adequate disposal facilities
which no fashionable moviemaker was likely to stumble upon.
As Oskar had forewarned Stern in the front office of Buchheister's, the SS carried
economic warfare from door to door in Jakoba and Izaaka and J@ozefa. They broke into
apartments, dragged out the contents of closets, smashed the locks on desks and dressers.
They took valuables off fingers and throats and out of watch fobs. A girl who would not
give up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fur coat had her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arm broken; a boy from Ciemna Street who wanted to keep
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) skis was shot.
Some of those whose goods were taken--unaware that the SS were operating outside
legal restraint--would tomorrow complain at police stations. Somewhere, history told
them, was a senior officer with a little integrity who would be embarrassed and might
even discipline some of these unruly fellows. There would have to be an investigation
into the business of the boy in Ciemna and the wife whose nose was broken with a
truncheon. While the SS were working the apartment buildings, the Einsatzgruppe squad
moved against the fourteenth-century synagogue of Stara Bo@zn@ica. As they expected,
they found at prayer there a congregation of traditional Jews with beards and sidelocks
and prayer shawls. They collected a number of the less Orthodox from surrounding
apartments and drove them in as well, as if they wanted to measure the reaction of one
group to the other.
Among those pushed across the threshold of Stara Bo@zn@ica was the gangster Max
Redlicht, who would not otherwise have entered an ancient temple or been invited to do
so. They stood in front of the Ark, these two poles of the same tribe who would on a
normal day have found each other's company offensive. An Einsatz NCO opened the Ark
and took out the parchment Torah scroll. The disparate congregation on the synagogue
floor were to file past and spit at it. There was to be no faking--the spittle was to be
visible on the calligraphy.
The Orthodox Jews were more rational about it than
those others, the agnostics, the liberals, the
self-styled Europeans. It was apparent to the
Einsatz men that the modern ones balked in
front of the scroll and even tried to catch their
eye as if to say, Come on, we're all too
sophisticated for this nonsense. The SS men had
been told in their training that the European character of
liberal Jews was a tissue-thin facade, and in
Stara Bo@zn@ica the backsliding reluctance
of the ones who wore short haircuts and
contemporary clothes went to prove it.
Everyone spat in the end except Max
Redlicht. The Einsatzgruppe men may have
seen this as a test worth their time--to make a man
who visibly does not believe renounce with
spittle a book he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) views intellectually as
antique tribal drivel but which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blood
tells him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is still sacred. Could a Jew be
retrieved from the persuasions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) ridiculous blood? Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) think as clearly as Kant?
That was the test.
Redlicht would not pass it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) made a little speech. <div class="bookquote">``I've done a lot. But I won't do that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>They shot him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) first, and then shot the rest anyway and set fire to the place, making a shell
of the oldest of all Polish synagogues.

<p/>CHAPTER 5
Victoria Klonowska, a Polish secretary, was the beauty of Oskar's front office, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
immediately began a long affair with her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>). Ingrid, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) German mistress, must have known,
as surely as Emilie Schindler knew about Ingrid. For Oskar would never be a
surreptitious lover. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had a childlike sexual frankness. It wasn't that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) boasted. It was
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) never saw any need to lie, to creep into hotels by the back stairs, to knock quietly
on any girl's door in the small hours.
Since Oskar would not seriously try to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) women lies, their options were reduced;
traditional lovers' arguments were difficult.
Blond hair piled up above her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pretty,
foxy, vividly made-up face, Victoria
Klonowska looked like one of those lighthearted girls to whom the inconveniences of
history are a temporary intrusion into the real business of life. This autumn of simple
clothes, Klonowska was frivolous in her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) jacket and frilled blouse and slim skirt. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>)
was hardheaded, efficient, and adroit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) was a nationalist too, in the robust Polish style.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) would in the end negotiate with the German dignitaries for her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) Sudeten lover's
release from SS institutions. But for the moment Oskar had a less risky job for her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) mentioned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would like to find a good bar or cabaret in Cracow where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could
take friends. Not contacts, not senior people from the Armaments Inspectorate. Genuine
friends. Somewhere lively where middle-aged officials would not turn up. Did
Klonowska know of such a place?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) discovered an excellent jazz cellar in the narrow streets north of the Rynek, the city
square. It was a place that had always been popular with the students and younger staff of
the university, but Victoria herself had never been there before. The middle-aged men
who had pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) in peacetime would never want to go to a student dive.
If you wished to, it was possible to rent an
alcove behind a curtain for private parties under
cover of the tribal rhythms of the band. For finding this
music club, Oskar nicknamed Klonowska
<div class="bookquote">``Columbus.''  (<font color='red'><b>Klonowska/Victoria Klonowska</b></font>)</div>The Party line on jazz was that it
not only was artistically decadent but expressed
an African, a subhuman animality. The
ump-pa-pa of Viennese waltzes was the
preferred beat of the SS and of Party officials, and they earnestly avoided jazz clubs.
Round about Christmas in 1939, Oskar got together a party at the club for a number of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
friends. Like any instinctive cultivator of contacts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would never have any trouble
drinking with men he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) didn't like. But that night the guests were men he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) did. Additionally,
of course, they were all useful, junior but not uninfluential members of sundry agencies
of Occupation; and all of them more or less double exiles--not only were they away from
home, but home or abroad, they were all variously uneasy under the regime.
There was, for example, a young German
surveyor from the Government General's Division
of the Interior. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had marked out the boundaries of
Oskar's enamel factory in Zablocie. At
the back of Oskar's plant, Deutsche
Email Fabrik -LRB-Def-RRB-, stood a vacant
area where two other manufactories abutted, a box factory and a radiator plant. Schindler
had been delighted to find that most of the waste area belonged, according to the
surveyor, to DEF. Visions of economic expansion danced in his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) head. The surveyor had,
of course, been invited because he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was a decent fellow, because you could talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>),
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) might be handy to know for future building permits.
The policeman Herman Toffel was there also, and the SD man Reeder, as well as a young
officer--also a surveyor, named Steinhauser--from the Armaments Inspectorate. Oskar
had met and taken to these men while seeking the permits he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) needed to start his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) plant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
had already enjoyed drinking bouts with them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would always believe that the best way
to untie bureaucracy's Gordian knot, short of bribery, was booze. Finally there were two
Abwehr men. The first was Eberhard Gebauer, the lieutenant who had recruited Oskar
into the Abwehr the year before. The second was Leutnant Martin Plathe of Canaris'
headquarters in Breslau. It had been through his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) friend Gebauer's recruitment that Herr
Oskar Schindler had first discovered what a city of opportunity Cracow was.
There would be a by-product from the presence of Gebauer and Plathe. Oskar was still on
the Abwehr's books as an agent and, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) years in Cracow, would keep the staff of
Canaris' Breslau office satisfied by passing on to them reports on the behavior of their
rivals in the SS. Gebauer and Plathe would consider his (<font color='blue'><b>Gebauer</b></font>) bringing along of a more-or-less
disaffected gendarme like Toffel, and of Reeder of the SD, as an intelligence favor, a gift
quite apart from the good company and the liquor.
Though it is not possible to say exactly what the members of the party talked about that
night, it is possible from what Oskar said later of each of these men to make a plausible
reconstruction.
It was Gebauer, of course, who would have made the toast, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Gebauer</b></font>) would not give
them governments, armies or potentates: instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Gebauer</b></font>) would give them the enamel factory
of their good friend Oskar Schindler. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) did so because if the factory prospered, there
would be more parties, parties in the Schindler style, the best parties you could imagine.
But after the toast had been drunk, the talk
turned naturally to the subject that bemused or
obsessed all levels of the civil
bureaucracy. The Jews.
Toffel and Reeder had spent the day at
Mogilska Station supervising the unloading of Poles and Jews from eastbound trains.
These people had been shipped in from the Incorporated Territories, newly conquered
regions which had been German in the past. Toffel wasn't making a point about the
comfort of the passengers in the Ostbahn cattle cars, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Toffel</b></font>) confessed that the
weather had been cold. But the transport of populations in livestock carriages was new to
everyone, and the cars were not as yet inhumanly crowded. What confused Toffel was the
policy behind it all.
There is a persistent rumor, said Toffel, that
we are at war. And in the midst of it the
Incorporated Territories are too damn
simon-pure to put up with a few Poles and a half-million Jews. <div class="bookquote">``The whole Ostbahn
system,''  (<font color='red'><b>Toffel/Herman Toffel</b></font>)</div>said Toffel, <div class="bookquote">``has to be turned over to delivering them to us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Toffel/Herman Toffel</b></font>)</div>The Abwehr men listened, slight smiles on their faces. To the SS the enemy within might
be the Jew, but to the Canaris the enemy within was the SS.
The SS, Toffel said, had reserved the entire rail system from November 15 on.
Across his (<font color='blue'><b>Toffel</b></font>) desk in Pomorska Street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Toffel</b></font>) said,
had crossed copies of angry SS memoranda
addressed to Army officials and complaining that the
Army was welching on its deal, had gone two
weeks over schedule in its use of the
Ostbahn. For Christ's sake, Toffel
asked, shouldn't the Army have first use, for as long as it liked, of the railway system?
How else is it to deploy east and west? Toffel asked, drinking excitedly. On bicycles?
Oskar was half-amused to see that the Abwehr men did not comment. They suspected
Toffel might be a plant instead of simply being drunk. The surveyor and the man from
the Armaments Inspectorate asked Toffel some questions about these remarkable trains
arriving at Mogilska.
Soon such shipments wouldn't be worth talking about:
transports of humans would become a clich`e of resettlement policy. But on the evening
of Oskar's Christmas party, they were still a novelty.
<div class="bookquote">``They call it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Toffel/Herman Toffel</b></font>)</div>said Toffel, <div class="bookquote">``concentration.
That's the word you find in the documents.
Concentration. I call it bloody obsession.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Toffel/Herman Toffel</b></font>)</div>The owner of the jazz club brought in plates of
herring and sauce. The fish went down well with the
fiery liquor, and as they wolfed it, Gebauer
spoke about the Judenrats, the Jewish
councils set up in each community on the order
of Governor Frank. In cities like Warsaw
and Cracow the Judenrat had twenty-four
elected members personally responsible for the
fulfillment of the orders of the regime. The
Judenrat of Cracow had been in existence for
less than a month; Marek
Biberstein, a respected municipal
authority, had been appointed its president. But, Gebauer remarked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gebauer</b></font>) had heard that it
had already approached Wawel Castle with a plan for a roster of Jewish labor. The
Judenrat would supply the labor details for digging ditches and latrines and clearing
snow. Didn't everyone find that excessively cooperative of them?
Not at all, said engineer Steinhauser of the Armaments Inspectorate. They thought that if
they supplied the labor squads it would stop random press-ganging. Press-ganging led to
beatings and the occasional bullet in the head.
Martin Plathe agreed. They'll be cooperative for the sake of avoiding something worse,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Plathe</b></font>) said. It's their method--you have to understand that. They'd always bought the civil
authorities off by cooperating with them and then negotiating.
Gebauer seemed to be out to mislead Toffel and
Reeder by pushing the point, by seeming more
passionately analytic about Jews than he (<font color='blue'><b>Toffel</b></font>)
really was. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what I mean
by cooperation,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Toffel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Frank passes an
edict demanding that every Jew in the Government
General wear a star. That edict's only a
few weeks old. In Warsaw you've got a
Jewish manufacturer churning them out in washable plastic at three z@loty each. It's as if
they've got no idea what sort of law it is. It's as if the thing were an emblem of a bicycle
club.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Herr Schindler/Herr Direktor/Schindler</b></font>)</div>It was suggested then that since Schindler was in the enamel business, it might be
possible to press a deluxe enamel badge at the Schindler plant and retail it through the
hardware outlet his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) girlfriend Ingrid supervised. Someone remarked that the star was their
national insigne, the insigne of a state that had been destroyed by the Romans and that
now existed only in the minds of Zionists. So perhaps people were proud to wear the star.
<div class="bookquote">``The thing is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gebauer/Eberhard Gebauer</b></font>)</div>said Gebauer, <div class="bookquote">``they don't have any organization for saving themselves.
They've got weathering-the-storm sorts of organizations. But this one's going to be
different. This storm will be managed by the SS.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gebauer/Eberhard Gebauer</b></font>)</div>Gebauer, again, sounded as if without
being too florid about it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gebauer</b></font>) approved of the professional thoroughness of the SS. <div class="bookquote">``Come
on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin Plathe/Plathe</b></font>)</div>said Plathe; <div class="bookquote">``the worst that can happen to them is that they'll get sent to Madagascar,
where the weather is better than it is in Cracow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martin Plathe/Plathe</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe they'll ever see
Madagascar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gebauer/Eberhard Gebauer</b></font>)</div>said Gebauer.
Oskar demanded a change of subject.
Wasn't it .his (<font color='blue'><b>Gebauer</b></font>) party?
In fact, Oskar had already seen Gebauer hand over forged papers for a flight to Hungary
to a Jewish businessman in the bar of the Hotel Cracovia. Maybe Gebauer was taking a
fee, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gebauer</b></font>) seemed too morally sensitive to deal in papers, to sell a signature, a rubber
stamp. But it was certain, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gebauer</b></font>) act in front of Toffel, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gebauer</b></font>) was no abominator
of Jews. Nor was any of them. At Christmas 1939 Oskar found them simply a relief from
the orotund official line.
Later they would have more positive uses.

<p/>CHAPTER 6
The Aktion of the night of December 4 had convinced Stern that Oskar Schindler was
that rarity, the just Goy. There is the Talmudic legend of the Hasidei Ummot Ha-olam,
the Righteous of the Nations, of whom there are said to be--at any point in the world's
history--thirty-six. Stern did not believe literally in the mystical number, but the legend
was psychologically true for him (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) believed it a decent and wise course to try to
make of Schindler a living and breathing sanctuary.
The German needed capital--the Rekord plant had been partially stripped of machinery,
except for one small gallery of metal presses, enamel bins, lathes, and furnaces. While
Stern might be a substantial spiritual influence on Oskar, the man who put him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) in touch
with capital on good terms was Abraham Bankier, the office manager of Rekord, whom
Oskar had won over.
The two of them--big, sensual Oskar and squat, elfin Bankier--went visiting possible
investors. By a decree of November 23, the bank and safe deposits of all Jews were held
by the German administration, in fixed trust, without allowing the owner any right of
access or interest. Some of the wealthier Jewish businessmen, those who knew anything
about history, kept secret funds in hard currencies. But they could tell that for a few years
under Governor Hans Frank, currencies would be risky;
portable wealth--diamonds, gold, trade goods
--would be desirable.
Around Cracow there were a number of men Bankier knew who were willing to put up
investment capital in return for a guaranteed quantity of product. The deal might be an
investment of 50,000 z@loty in return for so many kilos of pots and pans a month,
delivery to begin July 1940 and to continue for a year. For a Cracow Jew, given Hans
Frank in the Wawel, kitchenware was safer and more disposable than z@loty. The
parties to these contracts--Oskar, the investor, Bankier as middleman--brought away
from these arrangements nothing, not even deal memoranda. Full-fledged contracts were
of no use and could not be enforced anyhow. Nothing could be enforced. It all depended
on Bankier's accurate judgment of this Sudeten manufacturer of enamelware.
The meetings would take place perhaps in the investor's apartment in the Centrum of
Cracow, the old inner city. The Polish landscapists the investor's wife adored, the French
novels his (<font color='blue'><b>investor</b></font>) bright and fragile daughters savored would glow in the light of the transaction.
Or else the investing gentleman had already been thrown out of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) apartment and lived
in poorer quarters in Podg@orze. And he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would be a man already in shock--his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
apartment gone and himself now an employee in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own business --and all this in a few
months, the year not over yet.
At first sight, it seems a heroic embellishment of the story to say that Oskar was never
accused of welching on these informal contracts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would in the new year have a fight
with one Jewish retailer over the quantity of product the man was entitled to take from
DEF'S loading dock in Lipowa Street. And the gentleman would be critical of Oskar on
those grounds to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) life. But that Oskar did not fulfill deals-- that was never
said.
For Oskar was by nature a payer, who somehow gave the impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could make
limitless repayments out of limitless resources. In any case, Oskar and other German
opportunists would make so much in the next four years that only a man consumed by the
profit motive would have failed to repay what Oskar's father would have called a debt of
honor.
Emilie Schindler came up to Cracow, to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) husband there for the first time, in the
new year. She (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) thought the city was the most delightful she (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had ever been in, so much
more gracious and pleasant and old-fashioned than Brno with its clouds of industrial
smoke.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was impressed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) husband's new apartment. The front windows looked across
at the Planty, an elegant ring of parkland that ran right around the city following the route
of the ancient walls long since knocked down. At the bottom of the street the great
fortress of Wawel rose, and amidst all this antiquity was Oskar's modern apartment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
looked around at Mrs. Pfefferberg's fabrics and wall hangings. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) new success was
tangible in them.
<div class="bookquote">``You've done very well in Poland,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) said. Oskar knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was really talking
about the matter of the dowry, the one her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) father had refused to pay a dozen years back
when travelers from Zwittau had rushed into the village of Alt-Molstein with news that
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son-in-law was living and loving like an unmarried man. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter's marriage had
become exactly the marriage he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had feared it would, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was damned if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d pay.
And though the absence of the 400,000 RM. had altered Oskar's prospects a little, the
gentleman farmer of Alt-Molstein did not know how the nonpayment would pain his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
daughter, make her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) even more defensive, nor that twelve years later, when it no longer
counted for Oskar, it would be still at the front of Emilie's mind.
<div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar was always growling, <div class="bookquote">``I never needed the damn money.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Emilie's intermittent relations with Oskar seem to have been those of a woman who
knows her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband is not and will not be faithful, but who nonetheless doesn't want
evidence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) affairs thrust under her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nose. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must have moved warily in Cracow,
going to parties where Oskar's friends would surely know the truth, would know the
names of the other women, the names she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not really want to hear.
One day a young Pole--it was Poldek
Pfefferberg, who had nearly shot her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not know that--arrived at the door of the apartment
with a rolled-up rug over his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shoulder. It was a
black-market rug from Istanbul via
Hungary, and Pfefferberg had been
given the job of finding it by Ingrid, who had moved out for the duration of Emilie's
visit.
<div class="bookquote">``Is Frau Schindler in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Pfefferberg/Poldek Pfefferberg/Poldek</b></font>)</div>asked
Pfefferberg. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) always referred to Ingrid as Frau Schindler because he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) thought it was less
offensive.
<div class="bookquote">``I am Frau Schindler,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emilie/Emilie Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Emilie,
knowing what the question meant.
Pfefferberg showed some sensitivity in covering up. Actually he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) did not need to see Frau
Schindler, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d heard so much about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) from Herr Schindler. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had to see Herr
Schindler about some business matter.
Herr Schindler wasn't in, said Emilie.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) offered Pfefferberg a drink, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) hastily refused. Emilie knew what that meant too.
That the young man was just a little shocked by Oskar's personal life and thought it
indecent to sit and drink with the victim.
The factory Oskar had leased was across the river in Zablocie at No. 4 Lipowa Street.
The offices, which faced the street, were modern in design, and Oskar thought it might be
possible and convenient for him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to move in at some time, to have an apartment on the
third floor, even though the surroundings were industrial and not as exhilarating as
Straszewskiego Street.
When Oskar took over the Rekord works,
renaming it Deutsche Emailwaren Fabrik,
there were forty-five employees involved in a
modest output of kitchenware. Early in the new
year he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) received his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) first Army contracts. They were
no surprise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had cultivated various
influential Wehrmacht engineers who sat on
the Main Armaments Board of General
Schindler's Armaments Inspectorate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had
gone to the same parties and taken them to dinner at the
Cracovia Hotel. There are photographs of
Oskar sitting with them at expensive tables,
everyone smiling urbanely at the camera, everyone
well fed, generously liquored, and the officers
elegantly uniformed. Some of them put the right
stamps on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) bids, and wrote the crucial letters
of recommendation to General Schindler, merely out
of friendship and because they believed Oskar had the
plant and would deliver. Others were influenced
by gifts, the sort of gifts Oskar would always
proffer to officials--cognac and carpets,
jewelry and furniture and hampers of
luxury food. As well as that, it became known that General Schindler was acquainted
withand liked very much his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) enamelware-producing namesake. Now, with the authority
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) lucrative Armaments Inspectorate contracts, Oskar was permitted to expand his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
plant. There was room. Beyond the lobby and offices of DEF stood two large industrial
lofts. Some of the floor space in the building on the left as you emerged from the lobby
into the interior of the factory was occupied by present production. The other building
was totally empty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) bought new machinery, some locally, some from the homeland.
Apart from the military demand, there was the all-devouring black market to serve. Oskar
knew now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could be a magnate.
By midsummer of 1940 he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would be employing 250 Poles and would be faced with
instituting a night shift. Herr Hans Schindler's farm-machinery plant in Zwittau had at the
best of times employed 50. It is a sweet thing to outstrip a father whom you haven't
forgiven. At times throughout the year, Itzhak Stern would call on Schindler to arrange
employment for some young Jew--a special case; an orphan from @l@od@z; the
daughter of a clerk in one of the departments of the Judenrat -LRB-jewish Council-RRB-. Within a
few months, Oskar was employing 150 Jewish workers and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) factory had a minor
reputation as a haven.
It was a year, like each succeeding year for the rest of the war, when Jews would be
looking for some employment considered essential to the war effort. In April, Governor
General Frank had decreed an evacuation of Jews from his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) capital, Cracow. It was a
curious decision, since the Reich authorities were still moving Jews and Poles back into
the Government General at the rate of nearly 10,000 a day. Yet conditions in Cracow,
Frank told his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) cabinet, were scandalous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) knew of German divisional commanders who
had to live in apartment buildings that contained Jewish tenants. Higher officials were
also subjected to the same scandalous indignity. Over the next six months, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) promised,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) would make Cracow judenfrei -LRB-free of Jews-RRB-. There would be a permitted remnant of
5,000 to 6,000 skilled Jewish workers.
All the rest were to be moved into other cities in the Government General, into Warsaw
or Radom, Lublin, or Czestochowa. Jews could immigrate voluntarily to the city of their
choice as long as they did it before August 15. Those still left in the city after that date
would be trucked out with a small amount of luggage to whatever place suited the
administration. From November 1, said Hans Frank, it would be possible for the Germans
of Cracow to breathe <div class="bookquote">``good German air,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Germans</b></font>)</div>to walk abroad without seeing the streets and
lanes <div class="bookquote">``crawling with Jews.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Germans</b></font>)</div>Frank would not manage that year to reduce the Jewish population to quite so low a level;
but when his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) plans were first announced, there was a rush among the Jews of Cracow,
especially among the young, to acquire skilled qualifications. Men like Itzhak Stern,
official and unofficial agents of the Judenrat, had already developed a list of
sympathizers, Germans to whom they could appeal. Schindler was on that list; so was
Julius Madritsch, a Viennese who had recently managed to get himself released from the
Wehrmacht and taken up the post of Treuh@ander of a plant manufacturing military
uniforms.
Madritsch could see the benefits of Armaments Inspectorate's contracts and now
intended to open a uniform factory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) own in the suburb of Podg@orze. In the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>)
would make an even larger fortune than Schindler, but in the annus mirabilis of 1940 he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
was still on a salary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was known to be humane--that was all. By November 1, 1940,
Frank had managed to move 23,000 Jewish volunteers out of Cracow. Some of them
went to the new ghettos in Warsaw and @l@od@z. The gaps at table, the grieving at
railway stations can be imagined, but people took it meekly, thinking, We'll do this, and
that will be the brunt of what they ask. Oskar knew it was happening, but, like the Jews
themselves, hoped it was a temporary excess.
That year would very likely be the most industrious of Oskar's life--a year spent
building the place up from a bankrupt manufactory to a company government agencies
could take seriously. As the first snows fell, Schindler noticed and was irritated when, on
any given day, 60 or more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) Jewish employees would be absentees. They would
have been detained by SS squads on the way to work and employed in clearing snow.
Herr Schindler visited his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) friend Toffel at SS headquarters in Pomorska Street to
complain.
On one day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) told Toffel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
had 125 absentees.
Toffel confided in him (<font color='blue'><b>Toffel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You've got to understand that some of these fellows here don't
give a damn about production. To them it's a matter of national priority that Jews be
made to shovel snow. I don't understand it myself ... it's got a ritual significance for
them, Jews shoveling snow. And it's not just you, it's happening to everyone.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar
asked if all the others were complaining too. Yes, said Toffel. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Toffel</b></font>) said, an
economic big shot from the SS Budget and Construction Office had come for lunch in
Pomorska and said that to believe the Jewish skilled worker had a place in Reich
economics was treasonable. <div class="bookquote">``I think you're going to have to put up with a lot of snow
shoveling yet, Oskar.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar, for the moment, assumed the stance of the outraged patriot, or perhaps of the
outraged profiteer. <div class="bookquote">``If they want to win the war,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar, <div class="bookquote">``they'd have to get rid of
SS men like that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Get rid of them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Toffel/Herman Toffel</b></font>)</div>asked Toffel. <div class="bookquote">``For Christ's sake, they're the bastards who're on top.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>As a result of such conversations, Oskar became an advocate of the principle that a
factory owner should have unimpeded access to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) own workers, that these workers
should have access to the plant, that they should not be detained or tyrannized on their
way to and from the factory. It was, in Oskar's eyes, a moral axiom as much as an
industrial one. In the end, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would apply it to its limit at Deutsche Email Fabrik.

<p/>CHAPTER 7
Some people from the big cities--from Warsaw and @l@od@z with their ghettos and
Cracow with Frank's commitment to making it judenfrei-- went to the countryside to
lose themselves among the peasants. The Rosner brothers, Cracovian musicians who
would come to know Oskar well, settled in the old village of Tyniec. It was on a pretty
bend of the Vistula, and an old Benedictine abbey on a limestone cliff hung above it. It
was anonymous enough for the Rosners, though. It had a few Jewish storekeepers and
Orthodox artisans, with whom nightclub musicians had little to converse about. But the
peasants, busy with the tedium of the harvest, were as pleased as the Rosners could have
hoped to find musicians in their midst.
They'd come to Tyniec not from Cracow, not from that
great marshaling point outside the botanical
gardens in Mogilska Street where young SS men
pushed people onto trucks and called out bland and lying
promises about the later delivery of all
adequately labeled baggage. They had come in
fact from Warsaw, where they had been enjoying an
engagement at the Basilisk. They had left the
day before the Germans sealed up the Warsaw ghetto
--Henry and Leopold and Henry's wife, Manci, and five-year-old son, Olek. The idea of
a south Polish village like
Tyniec, not far from their native Cracow, appealed to the brothers. It offered the option,
should conditions improve, of catching a bus into Cracow and finding work. Manci
Rosner, an Austrian girl, had brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sewing machine, and the Rosners set
up a little clothing business in Tyniec. In the evenings they played in the taverns and
became a sensation in a town like that. Villages welcome and support occasional
wonders, even Jewish ones. And the fiddle was, of all instruments, most venerated in
Poland.
One evening a traveling Volksdeutscher
-LRB-german-speaking Pole-RRB- from Poznan heard the
brothers playing outside the inn. The
Volksdeutscher was a municipal official
from Cracow, one of those Polish Germans in whose
name Hitler had taken the country in the first
place. The Volksdeutscher told Henry
that the mayor of Cracow,
Obersturmbannf@uhrer Pavlu, and his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>)
deputy, the renowned skier Sepp R@ohre, would be visiting the countryside at harvest
time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) would like to arrange for them to hear such an accomplished pair as the
Rosners.
On an afternoon when the bound sheaves lay drowsing in fields as quiet and as
abandoned as on Sunday, a convoy of limousines wound through Tyniec and up a rise to
the villa of an absentee Polish aristocrat. On the terrace, the dapper Rosner brothers
waited, and when all the ladies and gentlemen had been seated in a room that might once
have been used for balls, they were invited to perform. Henry and Leopold felt both
exultation and fear at the seriousness with which Obersturmbannf@uhrer Pavlu's party
had geared themselves for their playing. The women wore white dresses and gloves, the
military officials full dress, the bureaucrats their winged collars. When people went to
such trouble, it was easier to disappoint them. For a Jew, even to impose a cultural
disappointment on the regime was a serious crime.
But the audience loved them. They were a characteristically gem@utlich crowd; they
loved Strauss, the confections of Offenbach and Lehar, Andr`e Messager and Leo Fall. At
request time they grew mawkish.
And as Henry and Leopold performed, the ladies and gentlemen drank champagne from
long-stemmed flutes brought in by hamper. Once the official recital had finished, the
brothers were taken down the hill to where the peasants and the soldiers of the escort had
been gathered. If there was to be some crude racial demonstration, it would take place
here. But again, once the brothers had climbed onto a wagon and looked the crowd in the
eye, Henry knew they would be safe. The pride of the peasants, partly a national thing--
the Rosners being for the night a credit to Polish culture--all that protected them. It was
so like old times that Henry found himself smiling down at Olek and Manci, playing to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), capable of ignoring the rest. It did seem for those seconds that the earth had at last
been pacified by music.
When it was finished, a middle-aged SS
NCO--A Rottenf@uhrer -LRB-a junior
noncommissioned SS rank-RRB- perhaps--Henry not being as familiar as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) might become
with the gradations of SS rank--approached them as they stood by the wagon receiving
congratulations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) nodded to them and barely smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you have a nice harvest
holiday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, bowed, and left.
The brothers stared at each other. As soon as the SS man was out of hearing, they gave in
to the temptation to discuss his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meaning. Leopold was convinced. <div class="bookquote">``It's a threat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) said.
It went to show what they had feared in their marrow when the Volksdeutsche official
first spoke to them-- that these days it didn't do to stand out, to acquire a distinctive face.
That was life in the country in 1940. The curtailment of a career, the rustic tedium, the
scratching out of a trade, the occasional terror, the pull of that bright core called Cracow.
To that, the Rosners knew, they would eventually return.
Emilie had returned home in the autumn, and when Stern next came to Schindler's
apartment it was Ingrid who brought the coffee. Oskar made no secret of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) weaknesses,
and never seemed to think that ascetic Itzhak Stern needed any apologia for Ingrid's
presence. Similarly, when the coffee was finished, Oskar went to the liquor cabinet and
brought back a fresh bottle of brandy, setting it down on the table between his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) seat and
Stern's, as if Stern were really likely to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) drink it.
Stern had come that evening to tell Oskar that a family whom we shall call the C's were
spreading stories about him (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>), old David and young Leon C, saying even on the streets in
Kazimierz--let alone in parlors--that Oskar was a German gangster, a thug. When Stern
passed on these accusations to Oskar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) didn't use terms quite as vivid as that.
The reason an initial is employed here instead of a fictionalized name is that in Cracow
the whole range of Polish Jewish names were found, and that to employ any name other
than the C's' real one might cause offense to the memory of some vanished family or to
some living friend of Oskar's. Oskar knew Stern wasn't looking for a response, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>)
was just passing on intelligence.
But of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) had to respond
anyway.
<div class="bookquote">``I could spread stories about them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar. <div class="bookquote">``They're robbing me blind. Ask Ingrid if
you like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ingrid</b></font>)</div>Ingrid was the C's' supervisor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>) was a benign Treuh@ander and, being only in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>)
twenties, commercially inexperienced. The rumor was that Schindler himself had got the
girl appointed so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) would have an assured outlet for his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) kitchenware. The C's,
however, still did pretty well what they wanted with their company. If they resented the
idea that it was held in trust by the occupying power, no one could blame them for that.
Stern waved Oskar's suggestion away. Who was he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) to want to grill Ingrid? It wasn't
much use to compare notes with the girl anyhow. <div class="bookquote">``They run rings around Ingrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said
Oskar. They turned up at Lipowa Street for delivery of their orders and altered the
invoices on the spot and took away more than they had paid for. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>) says it's all right,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>they'd tell the Schindler employees. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)'s arranged it with Ingrid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The son</b></font>)</div>The son had in fact been gathering crowds and
telling them that Schindler had had the SS beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
up. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) story varied--the beating was supposed
to have occurred at Schindler's factory, in a
storeroom from which young C emerged with a black eye
and broken teeth. Then it was supposed to have
occurred on Limanowskiego, in front of
witnesses. A man called F, an employee
of Oskar's and a friend of the C's, had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d heard Oskar stamping up and down in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) office in Lipowa Street and threatening to kill old David C. Then Oskar was said to
have driven around to Stradom and raided the C cash register, to have stuffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) pockets
with currency and told them that there was a New Order in Europe, and then to have
beaten up old David in his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) office.
Was it possible that Oskar could let fly at old David C and land him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) in bed with bruises?
Was it likely he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would call on friends in the
police to assault Leon? On one level
Oskar and the C's were gangsters, selling tons of
kitchenware illegally, without sending records of
sales to the Transferstelle, without use of the
required merchandizing coupons called
Bezugschein. On the black market, the
dialogue was primitive and tempers were short. Oskar admitted he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d raged into the C's'
showroom and called father and son thieves and indemnified himself out of the till for the
kitchenware the C's had taken without authorization. Oskar admitted he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d punched young
Leon. But that was the limit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) admissions.
And the C's, whom Stern had known since childhood--they had one of those reputations.
Not exactly criminal, but sharp in dealing and, significant in this case, with a reputation
for squealing when caught.
Stern knew Leon C's bruises did exist. Leon wore them down the street and was willing
to elaborate on them. The SS beating did take place somewhere or other, but it could have
had a dozen causes. Stern not only did not believe that Oskar had begun asking the SS for
that sort of favor, but also had the sense that to believe or disbelieve what was said to
have happened in this case was irrelevant to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) own wider purposes. It would become
relevant only when and if Herr Schindler established a brutal pattern. For Stern's
purposes, occasional lapses did not count. Had Oskar been without sin, this apartment
would not exist in its present form, and neither would Ingrid be waiting in the bedroom.
And it is yet again one of those things which must be said, that Oskar would save all of
them--Mr. and Mrs. C, Leon C, Mr. H, Miss M, old C's secretary--and that they would
always admit that, but that they would also and always stick to their story of the bruises.
That evening Itzhak Stern also brought news of Marek Biberstein's jail sentence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) had
got two years in the prison in Montelupich Street, this Marek Biberstein who was the
president of the Judenrat, or who had been until his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) arrest. In other cities the Judenrat was
already cursed by the general Jewish population, for its main work had become the
drawing up of lists for forced labor, for transfers to camps. The Judenrats were regarded
by the German administration as organs of its will, but in Cracow, Marek Biberstein and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>) cabinet still saw themselves as buffers between the office of the military mayor of
Cracow, Schmid and later Pavlu, on one hand, and the Jewish inhabitants of the city on
the other. In the Cracow German newspaper of March 13, 1940, a Dr. Dietrich Redecker
said that on a visit to the Judenrat office he (<font color='blue'><b>Dietrich</b></font>) was struck by the contrast between its carpet
and plush chairs and the poverty and squalor of the Jewish quarter in Kazimierz. But
Jewish survivors do not remember the first Cracow Judenrat as men who cut themselves
off from the people. Hungry for revenue, however, they had made the mistake the
Judenrats of @l@od@z and Warsaw had made before them, permitting the affluent to
buy their way off forced-labor lists, forcing the poor onto the roster in return for soup and
bread. But even later, in 1941, Biberstein and his (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>) council still had the respect of the Jews
of Cracow.
That first membership of the Judenrat consisted of twenty-four men, most of them
intellectuals. Each day, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>) way to Zablocie, Oskar passed their corner office in
Podg@orze into which were crowded a number of secretariats.
In the manner of a cabinet, each member of the council took care of a different aspect of
government. Mr. Schenker had charge of taxes, Mr. Steinberg of buildings--an essential
job in a society where people drifted in and out, this week trying the option of refuge in
some small village, next week walking back to town surfeited with the narrowness of the
peasants. Leon Salpeter, a pharmacist by profession, had charge of one of the socialwelfare
agencies.
There were secretariats for food, cemeteries,
health, travel documentation, economic
affairs, administrative services, culture,
even--in the face of the ban on schooling--of education.
Biberstein and his (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>) council believed on principle that the Jews who were expelled from
Cracow would end up in worse places, and so they decided to fall back on an ancient
stratagem: bribery. The hard-up Judenrat treasury allocated 200,000 z@loty for the
purpose. Biberstein and the Housing Secretary, Chaim Goldfluss, had sought out an
intermediary, in this case a Volksdeutscher named Reichert, a man who had contacts in
the SS and the city administration. Reichert's task was to pass on the money to a series of
officials beginning with Obersturmf@uhrer -LRB-an SS rank equivalent to first lieutenant-RRB-
Seibert, the liaison officer between the Judenrat and the city government. In return for the
money, the officials were to permit another 10,000 Jews of the Cracow community to
remain at home, despite Frank's order. Whether Reichert had insulted officials by
retaining too large a percentage for himself and making too low an offer, or whether the
gentlemen involved felt that Governor Frank's most cherished ambition to render his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) city
judenfrei made the taking of bribes too perilous, no one could tell from the court
proceedings. But Biberstein had got two years in Montelupich, Goldfluss six months in
Auschwitz. Reichert himself had got eight years. Yet everyone knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Reichert</b></font>) would have a
softer time of it than the other two.
Schindler shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) head at the idea of putting 200,000 z@loty on such a fragile hope.
<div class="bookquote">``Reichert is a crook,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) murmured. Just ten minutes before, they had been discussing
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) and the C's were crooks and had let the question stand. But there was no
doubt about Reichert. <div class="bookquote">``I could have told them Reichert was a crook,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Reichert</b></font>) kept insisting.
Stern commented--as a philosophic principle
--that there were times when the only people left to do business with were crooks.
Schindler laughed at that--a wide, toothy, almost rustic laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much,
my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) told Stern.

<p/>CHAPTER 8
It wasn't such a bad Christmas that year. But there was a wistfulness, and snow lay like a
question in the parkland across from Schindler's apartment, like something posed,
watchful and eternal, on the roof of the Wawel up the road and under the ancient facades
of Kanonicza Street. No one believed anymore in a quick resolution--neither the soldiery
nor the Poles nor the Jews on either side of the river.
For his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) Polish secretary Klonowska, that
Christmas, Schindler bought a poodle, a
ridiculous Parisian thing, acquired
by Pfefferberg. For Ingrid he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) bought jewelry and
sent some also to gentle Emilie down in
Zwittau. Poodles were hard to find,
Leopold Pfefferberg reported. But jewelry was a snap. Because of the times, gems were
in a high state of movement.
Oskar seems to have pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) simultaneous attachments to three women and sundry
casual friendships with others, all without suffering the normal penalties that beset the
womanizer. Visitors to his (<font color='blue'><b>womanizer</b></font>) apartment cannot remember ever finding Ingrid sulking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>)
seems to have been a generous and complaisant girl. Emilie, with even greater grounds
for complaint, had too much dignity to make the scenes Oskar richly deserved. If
Klonowska had any resentment, it does not seem to have affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) manner in the front
office of DEF nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) loyalty to the Herr Direktor. One could expect that in a life like
Oskar's, public confrontations between angry women would be commonplace. But no
one among Oskar's friends and workers--witnesses willing enough to admit and even in
some cases chuckle over his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) sins of the flesh--remembers such painful confrontations, so
often the fate of far more restrained philanderers than Oskar.
To suggest as some have that any woman would be pleased with partial possession of
Oskar is to demean the women involved. The problem was, perhaps, that if you wanted to
talk to Oskar about fidelity, a look of childlike and authentic bewilderment entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
eyes, as if you were proposing some concept like Relativity which could be understood
only if the listener had five hours to sit still and concentrate. Oskar never had five hours
and never understood.
Except in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) mother's case. That Christmas morning, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) dead mother's sake, Oskar
went to Mass at the Church of St. Mary. There was a space above the high altar where
Wit Stwosz's wooden tryptych had until weeks ago diverted worshipers with its crowd of
jostling divinities. The vacancy, the pallor of the stone where the tryptych's fixings had
been, distracted and abashed Herr Schindler. Someone had stolen the tryptych. It had
been shipped to Nuremberg. What an improbable world it had become!
Business was wonderful that winter just the same. In the next year his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) friends in the
Armaments Inspectorate began to talk to Oskar about the possibility of opening a
munitions division to manufacture antitank shells. Oskar was not as interested in shells as
in pots and pans. Pots and pans were easy engineering. You cut out and pressed the
metal, dipped it in the tubs, fired it at the right temperature. You didn't have to calibrate
instruments; the work was nowhere near as exacting as it would be for arms. There was
no under-the-counter trade in shell casings, and Oskar liked under-the-counter--liked the
sport of it, the disrepute, the fast returns, the lack of paperwork.
But because it was good politics, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) established a munitions section, installing a few
immense Hilo machines, for the precision pressing and tooling of shell casings, in one
gallery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) No. 2 workshop. The munitions section was so far developmental; it would
take some months of planning, measuring, and test production before any shells
appeared. The big Hilos, however, gave the Schindler works, as a hedge against the
questionable future, at least the appearance of essential industry.
Before the Hilos had even been properly calibrated, Oskar began to get hints from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) SS
contacts at Pomorska Street that there was to be a ghetto for Jews. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) mentioned the
rumor to Stern, not wanting to arouse alarm. Oh, yes, said Stern, the word was out. Some
people were even looking forward to it. We'll be inside, the enemy will be outside. We
can run our own affairs. No one will envy us, no one stone us in the streets. The walls of
the ghetto will be fixed. The walls would be the final, fixed form of the catastrophe.
The edict, <div class="bookquote">``Gen. Gub. 44/91,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>posted on March 3, was published in the Cracow dailies
and blared forth from loudspeakers on trucks in Kazimierz. Walking through his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>)
munitions department, Oskar heard one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) German technicians comment on the
news. <div class="bookquote">``Won't they be better off in there?''  (<font color='red'><b>the technician</b></font>)</div>asked the technician. <div class="bookquote">``The Poles hate them,
you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The edict used the same excuse. As a
means of reducing racial conflict in the
Government General, a closed Jewish quarter would be set up. Enclosure in the ghetto
would be compulsory for all Jews, but those with the proper labor card could travel from
the ghetto to work, returning in the evening. The ghetto would be located in the suburb of
Podg@orze just across the river. The deadline for entering it would be March 20. Once
in, you would be allocated housing by the Judenrat, but Poles presently living in the area
of the ghetto and who therefore had to move were to apply to their own housing office for
apartments in other parts of town.
A map of the new ghetto was appended to the edict. The north side would be bounded by
the river, the east end by the railway line to Lw@ow, the south side by the hills beyond
Rekawka, the west by Podg@orze Place. It would be crowded in there.
But there was hope that repression would take definite form now and provide people with
a basis on which to plan their restricted futures. For a man like Juda Dresner, a textile
wholesaler of Stradom Street who would come to know Oskar, the past year and a half
had brought a bewildering succession of decrees, intrusions, and confiscations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had
lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) business to the Trust Agency, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) car, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) apartment. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) bank account had been
frozen. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) children's schools had been closed, or else they had been expelled from them.
The family's jewelry had been
seized, and their radio. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) family were
forbidden entry to the center of Cracow, denied any
travel by train. They could use only
segregated trolley cars. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wife and
daughter and sons were subject to intermittent roundups for snow shoveling or other
compulsory labor. You never knew, when you were forced into the back of a truck, if the
absence would be a short or long one, or what sort of hair-trigger madmen might be
supervising the work you would be forced to. Under this sort of regimen you felt that life
offered no footholds, that you were slithering into a pit which had no bottom. But perhaps
the ghetto was the bottom, the point at which it was possible to take organized thought.
Besides, the Jews of Cracow were accustomed--in a way that could best be described as
congenital-- to the idea of a ghetto. And now that it had been decided, the very word had
a soothing, ancestral ring. Their grandfathers had not been permitted to emerge from the
ghetto of Kazimierz until 1867, when Franz Josef signed a decree permitting them to live
wherever they wished in the city. Cynics said that the Austrians had needed to open up
Kazimierz, socketed as it was in the elbow of the river so close to Cracow, so that Polish
laborers could find accommodation close to their places of work. But Franz Josef was
nonetheless revered by the older people from Kazimierz as energetically as he (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) had been
in the childhood household of Oskar Schindler.
Although their liberty had come so late, there was at the same time among the older
Cracow Jews a nostalgia for the old ghetto of Kazimierz. A ghetto implied certain
squalors, a crowding in tenements, a sharing of bathroom facilities, disputes over drying
space on clotheslines. Yet it also consecrated the Jews to their own specialness, to a
richness of shared scholarship, to songs and Zionist talk, elbow to elbow, in coffeehouses
rich in ideas if not in cream. Evil rumors emanated from the ghettos of @l@od@z and
Warsaw, but the Podg@orze ghetto as planned was more generous with space, for if you
superimposed it on a map of the Centrum, you found that the ghetto was in area about
half the size of the Old City--by no means enough space, but not quite strangulation.
There was also in the edict a sedative clause that promised to protect the Jews from their
Polish countrymen. Since the early 1930's, a willfully orchestrated racial contest had
prevailed in Poland. When the Depression began and farm prices fell, the Polish
government had sanctioned a range of anti-Semitic political groups of the kind that saw
the Jews as the base of all their economic troubles.
Sanacja, Marshal Pilsudski's Moral
Cleansing Party, made an alliance after the old
man's death with the Camp of National Unity, a
right-wing Jew-baiting group. Prime Minister
Skladkowski, on the floor of the Parliament in
Warsaw, declared, <div class="bookquote">``Economic war on the
Jews? All right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Minister</b></font>)</div>Rather than give the peasants
land reform, Sanacja encouraged them to look at
the Jewish stalls on market day as the symbol
and total explanation of Polish rural
poverty. There were pogroms against the Jewish
population in a series of towns, beginning in
Grodno in 1935. The Polish legislators
also entered the struggle, and Jewish industries were
starved under new laws on bank credit. Craft
guilds closed their lists to Jewish artisans,
and the universities introduced a quota, or
what they themselves--strong in the classics--called
numerus clausus aut nullus -LRB-a closed
number or nil-RRB-, on the entry of Jewish
students. Faculties gave way to National Unity insistence that Jews be appointed special
benches in the quadrangle and be exiled to the left side of the lecture halls. Commonly
enough in Polish universities, the pretty and brilliant daughters of city Jewry emerged
from lecture halls to have their faces savaged by a quick razor stroke delivered by a lean,
serious youth from the Camp of National Unity.
In the first days of the German Occupation, the conquerors had been astounded by the
willingness of Poles to point out Jewish households, to hold a prayer-locked Jew still
while a German docked the Orthodox beard with scissors or, pinking the facial flesh as
well, with an infantry bayonet. In March 1941, therefore, the promise to protect the
ghetto dwellers from Polish national excess fell on the ear almost credibly.
Although there was no great spontaneous joy among the Jews of Cracow as they packed
for the move to Podg@orze, there were strange elements of homecoming to it, as well as
that sense of arriving at a limit beyond which, with any luck, you wouldn't be further
uprooted or tyrannized. Enough so that even some people from the villages around
Cracow, from Wieliczka, from Niepolomice, from Lipnica, Murowana, and Tyniec
hurried to town lest they be locked out on March 20 and find themselves in a comfortless
landscape. For the ghetto was by its nature, almost by definition, habitable, even if
subject to intermittent attack. The ghetto represented stasis instead of flux.
The ghetto would introduce a minor
inconvenience in Oskar Schindler's life. It was
usual for him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) luxury apartment in
Straszewskiego, pass the limestone lump of the
Wawel stuck in the mouth of the city like a cork in
a bottle, and so roll down through Kazimierz,
over the Kosciuszko bridge and left toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
factory in Zablocie. Now that route would be
blocked by the ghetto walls. It was a minor
problem, but it made the idea of maintaining an
apartment on the top floor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) office building
in Lipowa Street more reasonable. It wasn't
such a bad place, built in the style of
Walter Gropius. Lots of glass and light,
fashionable cubic bricks in the entranceway. Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) did travel between the city
and Zablocie in those March days before the deadline, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would see the Jews of
Kazimierz packing, and on Stradom Street would pass, early in the grace period, families
pushing barrows piled with chairs, mattresses, and clocks toward the ghetto. Their
families had lived in Kazimierz since the time it was an island separated from the
Centrum by a stream called Stara Wis@la. Since, in fact, the time Kazimier the Great had
invited them to Cracow when, elsewhere, they were footing the blame for the Black
Death. Oskar surmised that their ancestors would have turned up in Cracow like that,
pushing a barrowful of bedding, more than five hundred years before. Now they were
leaving, it seemed, with the same barrowful. Kazimier's invitation had been cancelled.
During those morning journeys across town, Oskar noticed that the plan was for the city
trolleys to go on rolling down Lw@owska Street, through the middle of the ghetto. All
walls facing the trolley line were being bricked up by Polish workmen, and where there
had been open spaces, cement walls were raised. As well, the trolleys would have their
doors closed as they entered the ghetto and could not stop until they emerged again in the
Umwelt, the Aryan world, at the corner of Lw@owska and @sw Kingi Street. Oskar
knew people would catch that trolley anyhow. Doors closed, no stops, machine guns on
walls--it wouldn't matter. Humans were incurable that way. People would try to get off
it, someone's loyal Polish maid with a parcel of sausage. And people would try to get on,
some fast-moving athletic young man like Leopold Pfefferberg with a pocketful of
diamonds or Occupation z@loty or a message in code for the partisans. People responded
to any slim chance, even if it was an outside one, its doors locked shut, moving fast
between mute walls.
From March 20, Oskar's Jewish workers would
not receive any wages and were meant to live entirely
by their rations. Instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would pay a fee to SS
headquarters in Cracow. Both Oskar and
Madritsch were uneasy about that, for they knew the
war would end and the slaveholders, just as in
America, would be shamed and stripped naked. The
dues he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would pay to the police chiefs were the
standard SS Main Administrative and
Economic Office fees--7.50
Reichsmarks per day for a skilled worker, 5 RM. for unskilled and women. They were,
by a margin, cheaper rates than those which operated on the open labor market. But for
Oskar and Julius Madritsch both, the moral discomfort outweighed the economic
advantage. The meeting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wage bill was the least of Oskar's worries that year.
Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was never an ideal capitalist. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) father had accused him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) often in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) youth
of being reckless with money. While he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a mere sales manager, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d maintained two
cars, hoping that Hans would get to hear of it and be shocked. Now, in Cracow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) could
afford to keep a stableful--a Belgian Minerva, a Maybach, an Adler cabriolet, a BMW.
To be a prodigal and still be wealthier than your more careful father--that was one of the
triumphs Schindler wanted out of life. In boom times the cost of labor was beside the
point.
It was that way for Madritsch too. Julius Madritsch's uniform mill stood on the western
side of the ghetto, a mile or so from Oskar's enamelworks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was doing so well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
was negotiating to open a similar plant in Tarnow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) too was a darling of the
Armaments Inspectorate, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) credit was so good that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had received a loan of a
million z@loty from the Bank Emisyjny -LRB-issue Bank-RRB-.
Whatever ethical queasiness they felt, it is
not likely that either entrepreneur, Oskar or
Julius, felt a moral obligation to avoid
employing additional Jews. That was a stance, and
since they were pragmatists, stances weren't their
style. In any case, Itzhak Stern as well
as Roman Ginter, a businessman and
representative of the Relief Office of the Judenrat, called on Oskar and Julius both and
begged them to employ more Jews, as many as could be fitted in. The objective was to
give the ghetto an economic permanence. It was almost axiomatic, Stern and Ginter
considered at that stage, that a Jew who had an economic value in a precocious empire
hungry for skilled workers was safe from worse things. And Oskar and Madritsch agreed.
So for two weeks the Jews trundled their barrows through Kazimierz and over the bridge
into Podg@orze. Middle-class families whose Polish servants had come with them to
help push the cart. At the bottom of the barrows lay the remaining brooches, the fur coats,
under mattresses and kettles and skillets.
Crowds of Poles on Stradom and Starovislna Streets jeered and hurled mud. <div class="bookquote">``The Jews
are going, the Jews are going.
Goodbye, Jews.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the citizens</b></font>)</div>Beyond the bridge a fancy wooden gate greeted the new citizens of the ghetto. White
with scalloped ramparts which gave it an Arabesque look, it had two wide arches for the
trolleys coming from and going to Cracow, and at the side was a white sentry box. Above
the arches, a title in Hebrew sought to reassure. JEWISH TOWN, it proclaimed. High
barbed-wire fences had been strung along the front of the ghetto, facing the river, and
open spaces were sealed with round-topped cement slabs nine feet tall, resembling strings
of gravestones for the anonymous. At the ghetto gate the trundling Jew was met by a
representative of the Judenrat Housing Office. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had a wife and large family, a man
might be assigned two rooms and have the use of a kitchen. Even so, after the good living
of the Twenties and Thirties, it was painful to have to share your private life with families
of different rituals, of another, distasteful musk and habits. Mothers screamed, and fathers
said things could be worse and sucked on hollow teeth and shook their heads. In the one
room, the Orthodox found the liberals an abomination. On March 20, the movement was
complete. Everyone outside the ghetto was forfeit and in jeopardy. Inside, for the
moment, there was living space.
Twenty-three-year-old Edith Liebgold was assigned a first-floor room to share with her (<font color='blue'><b>Liebgold</b></font>)
mother and her (<font color='blue'><b>Liebgold</b></font>) baby. The fall of Cracow eighteen months back had put her (<font color='blue'><b>Liebgold</b></font>) husband into
a mood verging on despair. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'d wandered away from home as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wanted to look into
the courses open to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had ideas about the forests, about finding a safe clearing. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had never returned.
From her (<font color='blue'><b>Liebgold</b></font>) end window Edith Liebgold could see
the Vistula through the barbed-wire barricade, but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Liebgold</b></font>) path to other parts of the ghetto, especially to the
hospital in Wegierska Street, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Liebgold</b></font>)
through Plac Zgody, Peace Square, the
ghetto's only square. Here, on the second day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Liebgold</b></font>) life inside the walls, she (<font color='blue'><b>Liebgold</b></font>) missed by
twenty seconds being ordered into an SS truck and taken to shovel coal or snow in the
city. It was not just that work details often, according to rumor, returned to the ghetto
with one or more fewer members than when they had left. More than this sort of odds,
Edith feared being forced into a truck when, half a minute earlier, you'd thought you
were going to Pankiewicz' pharmacy, and your baby was due to be fed in twenty
minutes. Therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) went with friends to the Jewish Employment Office. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) could
get shift work, her (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) mother would mind the baby at night.
The office in those first days was crowded. The Judenrat had its own police force now,
the Ordnungsdienst -LRB-or OD-RRB-, expanded and regularized to keep order in the ghetto, and a
boy with a cap and an armband organized waiting lines in front of the office.
Edith Liebgold's group were just inside the door, making lots of noise to pass the time,
when a small middle-aged man wearing a brown suit and a tie approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Liebgold</b></font>). They
could tell that they'd attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with their racket, their brightness. At first they thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intended to pick Edith up.
<div class="bookquote">``Look,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``rather than wait ... there is an enamel factory over in Zablocie.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let the address have its effect.
Zablocie was outside the ghetto, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was telling them. You could barter with the Polish
workers there. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needed ten healthy women for the night shift. The girls made faces, as
if they could afford to choose work and might even turn him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down. Not heavy, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) assured
them. And they'll teach you on the job. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, was Abraham Bankier. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
the manager. There was a German owner, of course. What sort of German? they asked.
Bankier grinned as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bankier</b></font>) suddenly wanted to fulfill all their hopes. Not a bad sort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bankier</b></font>) told
them.
That night Edith Liebgold met the other members of the enamel-factory night shift and
marched across the ghetto toward Zablocie under the guard of a Jewish OD. In the
column she (<font color='blue'><b>Liebgold</b></font>) asked questions about this Deutsche Email Fabrik. They serve a soup with
plenty of body, she (<font color='blue'><b>Liebgold</b></font>) was told. Beatings? she (<font color='blue'><b>Liebgold</b></font>) asked. It's not that sort of place, they said.
It's not like Beckmann's razor-blade factory; more like Madritsch. Madritsch is all right,
and Schindler too. At the entrance to the factory, the new night-shift workers were called
out of the column by Bankier and taken upstairs and past vacant desks to a door marked
HERR DIREKTOR. Edith Liebgold heard a deep voice tell them all to come in. They
found the Herr Direktor seated on the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) desk, smoking a cigarette. His (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) hair,
somewhere between blond and light brown, looked freshly brushed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) wore a doublebreasted
suit and a silk tie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) looked exactly like a man who had a dinner to go to but
had waited specially to have a word with them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) was immense; he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) was still young.
From such a Hitlerite dream, Edith expected a lecture on the war effort and increasing
production quotas. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to welcome you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) told them in Polish. <div class="bookquote">``You're part of
the expansion of this factory.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) looked away; it was even possible he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) was thinking,
Don't tell them that--they've got no stake in the place.
Then, without blinking, without any introduction, any qualifying lift of the shoulders, he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>)
told them, <div class="bookquote">``You'll be safe working here. If you work here, then you'll live through the
war.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) said good night and left the office with them, allowing Bankier to hold
them back at the head of the stairs so that the Herr Direktor could go down first and get
behind the wheel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) automobile. The promise had dazed them all. It was a godlike
promise. How could a mere man make a promise like that? But Edith Liebgold found
herself believing it instantly. Not so much because she (<font color='blue'><b>Liebgold</b></font>) wanted to; not because it was a
sop, a reckless incentive. It was because in the second Herr Schindler uttered the promise
it left no option but belief.
The new women of DEF took their job instruction in a pleasant daze. It was as if some
mad old Gypsy with nothing to gain had told them they would marry a count. The
promise had forever altered Edith Liebgold's expectation of life. If ever they did shoot
her (<font color='blue'><b>Liebgold</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Liebgold</b></font>) would probably stand there protesting, <div class="bookquote">``But the Herr Direktor said this couldn't
happen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The work made no mental demands. Edith carried the enamel-dipped pots, hanging by
hooks from a long stick, to the furnaces. And all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Edith</b></font>) pondered Herr Schindler's
promise.
Only madmen made promises as absolute as that. Without blinking. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) wasn't mad.
For he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was a businessman with a dinner to go to. Therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) must know. But that
meant some second sight, some profound contact with god or devil or the pattern of
things. But again, his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) appearance, his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hand with the gold signet ring, wasn't the hand of a
visionary. It was a hand that reached for the wine; it was a hand in which you could
somehow sense the latent caresses. And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) came back to the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) madness
again, to drunkenness, to mystical explanations, to the technique by which the Herr
Direktor had infected her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) with certainty.
Similar loops of reasoning would be traced this year and in years to come by all those to
whom Oskar Schindler made his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) heady promises. Some would become aware of the
unstated corollary. If the man was wrong, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lightly used his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) powers of passing on
conviction, then there was no God and no humanity, no bread, no succor. There were, of
course, only odds, and the odds weren't good.

<p/>CHAPTER 9
That spring Schindler left his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) factory in Cracow and drove west in a BMW over the
border and through the awakening spring forests to Zwittau. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had Emilie to see, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
aunts and sister. They had all been allies against his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) father; they were all tenders of the
flame of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) mother's martyrdom. If there was a parallel between his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) late mother's misery
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) wife's, Oskar Schindler--in his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) coat with the fur lapels, guiding the custom-made
wheel with kid-gloved hands, reaching for another Turkish cigarette on the straight
stretches of thawing road in the Jeseniks--did not see it. It was not a child's business to
see these things. His (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) father was a god and subject to tougher laws.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) liked visiting the aunts--the way they raised their hands palm upward in admiration
of the cut of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) suit. His (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) younger sister had married a railway official and lived in a
pleasant apartment provided by the rail authorities. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband was an important man in
Zwittau, for it was a rail-junction town and had large freight yards. Oskar drank tea with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband, and then some schnapps. There was a faint sense of mutual
congratulation: the Schindler children hadn't turned out so badly.
It was, of course, Oskar's sister who had nursed Frau Schindler in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) last illness and who
had now been visiting and speaking to their father in secret. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could do no more than
make certain hints in the direction of a reconciliation. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did that over the tea and was
answered by growls. Later, Oskar dined at home with Emilie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) was excited to have
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) there for the holiday. They could attend the Easter ceremonies together like an oldfashioned
couple. Ceremonies was right, for they danced around each other
ceremoniously all evening, attending to each other at table like polite strangers. And in
their hearts and minds, both Emilie and Oskar were amazed by this strange marriage
disability--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could offer and deliver more to strangers, to workers on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) factory
floor than he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>).
The question that lay between them was whether Emilie should join him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) in Cracow. If
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) gave up the apartment in Zwittau and put in other tenants, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) would have no escape
at all from Cracow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) believed it her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) duty to be with Oskar; in the language of Catholic
moral theology, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) absence from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) house was a <div class="bookquote">``proximate occasion of sin.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catholic</b></font>)</div>Yet life
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) in a foreign city would be tolerable only if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was careful and guarded and
sensitive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) feelings. The trouble with Oskar was that you could not depend on him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) lapses to himself. Careless, half-tipsy, half-smiling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) seemed sometimes to
think that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) really liked some girl, you had to like her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) too.
The unresolved question about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) going to Cracow lay so oppressively between them
that when dinner was finished he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) excused himself and went to a caf`e in the main square.
It was a place frequented by mining engineers, small businessmen, the occasional
salesman turned Army officer. Gratefully he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) saw some of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) biker friends there, most of
them wearing Wehrmacht uniforms. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) began drinking cognac with them. Some
expressed surprise that a big husky chap like Oskar was not in uniform.
<div class="bookquote">``Essential industry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) growled.
<div class="bookquote">``Essential industry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They reminisced about their motorcycle days.
There were jokes about the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d put together out of
spare parts when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was in high school. Its
explosive effects. The explosive effects
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) big 500cc Galloni. The noise
level in the caf`e mounted; more cognac was being shouted for. From the dining annex
old school friends appeared, that look on their faces as if they had recognized a forgotten
laugh, as in fact they had.
Then one of them got serious. <div class="bookquote">``Oskar, listen.
Your father's having dinner in there, all by himself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar Schindler looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
cognac. His (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) face burned, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) shrugged.
<div class="bookquote">``You ought to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>said someone. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'s a shadow, the poor old bastard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had better go home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) began to stand, but their hands were on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
shoulders, forcing him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) down again. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) knows you're here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they said. Two of them had
already gone through to the annex and were persuading old Hans Schindler over the
remnants of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) dinner. Oskar, in a panic, was already standing, searching in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) pocket
for the checkroom disk, when Herr Hans Schindler, his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) expression pained, appeared from
the dining room propelled gently along by two young men. Oskar was halted by the sight.
In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) anger at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d always imagined that if any ground was covered
between himself and Hans, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)'d be the one who'd have to cover it. The old man was so
proud. Yet here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was letting himself be dragged to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son.
As the two of them were pushed toward each other, the
old man's first gesture was an apologetic
half-grin and a sort of shrug of the eyebrows. The
gesture, by its familiarity, took Oskar
by storm. I couldn't help it, Hans was
saying. The marriage and everything, your mother and me, it all went according to laws
of its own. The idea behind the gesture might have been an ordinary one, but Oskar had
seen an identical expression on someone's face already that evening--on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) own, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
shrugged to himself, facing the mirror in the hallway of Emilie's apartment. The marriage
and everything, it's all going according to laws of its own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had shared that look with
himself, and here--three cognacs later--his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) father was sharing it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``How are you, Oskar?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans/Herr Hans Schindler/Hans Schindler</b></font>)</div>asked Hans
Schindler. There was a dangerous wheeze along the edge of the words. His (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) father's health
was worse than he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) remembered it.
So Oskar decided that even Herr Hans Schindler was human--a proposition he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had not
been able to swallow at teatime at his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) sister's; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) embraced the old man, kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
on the cheek three times, feeling the impact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) father's bristles, and beginning to weep
as the corps of engineers and soldiers and past motorcyclists applauded the gratifying
scene.

<p/>CHAPTER 10
The councilmen of Artur Rosenzweig's
Judenrat, who still saw themselves as guardians of the breath and health and bread ration
of the internees of the ghetto, impressed upon the Jewish ghetto police that they were also
public servants. They tended to sign up young men of compassion and some education.
Though at SS headquarters the OD was regarded as just another auxiliary police force
which would take orders like any police force, that was not the picture most OD men
lived by in the summer of `41.
It cannot be denied that as the ghettos grew older, the OD man became increasingly a
figure of suspicion, a supposed collaborator. Some OD men fed information to the
underground and challenged the system, but perhaps a majority of them found that their
existence and that of their families depended increasingly on the cooperation they gave
the SS. To honest men, the OD would become a corrupter. To crooks it was an
opportunity.
But in its early months in Cracow, it seemed
a benign force. Leopold Pfefferberg could stand
as a token of the ambiguity of being a member. When
all education for Jews, even that organized by the
Judenrat, was abolished in December
1940, Poldek had been offered a job
managing the waiting lines and keeping the appointment book in the Judenrat housing
office. It was a part-time job, but gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) a cover under which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) could travel around
Cracow with some freedom. In March 1941, the OD itself was founded with the stated
purpose of protecting the Jews entering the Podg@orze ghetto from other parts of the
city. Poldek accepted the invitation to put on the cap of the OD. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>)
understood its purpose--that it was not only to ensure rational behavior inside the walls
but also to achieve that correct degree of grudging tribal obedience which, in the history
of European Jewry, has tended to ensure that the oppressors will go away more quickly,
will become forgetful so that, in the interstices of their forgetfulness, life may again
become feasible.
At the same time Pfefferberg wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) OD
cap, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) ran illegal goods--leatherwork,
jewelry, furs, currency--in and out of the
ghetto gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) knew the Wachtmeister
at the gate, Oswald Bosko, a policeman
who had become so rebellious against the regime that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) let raw materials into the ghetto
to be made up into goods--garments, wine, hardware--and then let the goods out again
to be sold in Cracow, all without even asking for a bribe.
On leaving the ghetto, the officials at the gate, the lounging schmalzownicks, or
informers, Pfefferberg would take off the Judaic armband in some quiet alley before
moving on to business in Kazimierz or the Centrum.
On the city walls, above fellow passengers'
heads in the trolleys, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) would read the posters
of the day: the razor-blade advertisements, the
latest Wawel edicts on the harboring of
Polish bandits, the slogan <div class="bookquote">``JEWS--LICE
--TYPHUS,''  (<font color='red'><b>bandits</b></font>)</div>the billboard depicting a
virginal Polish girl handing food to a
hook-nosed Jew whose shadow was the shadow of the
Devil. <div class="bookquote">``WHOEVER HELPS A JEW
HELPS SATAN.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jews</b></font>)</div>Outside groceries
hung pictures of Jews mincing rats
into pies, watering milk, pouring lice into pastry, kneading dough with filthy feet. The
fact of the ghetto was being validated in the streets of Cracow by poster art, by
copywriters from the Propaganda Ministry. And Pfefferberg, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) Aryan looks, would
move calmly beneath the artwork, carrying a suitcase full of garments or jewelry or
currency.
Pfefferberg's greatest coup had been last year, when Governor Frank had withdrawn 100-
and 500-z@loty notes from circulation and demanded that existing notes of those
denominations be deposited with the Reich Credit Fund. Since a Jew could exchange
only 2,000 z@l., it meant that all notes held secretly--in excess of 2,000 and against the
regulations--would no longer have any value. Unless you could find someone with
Aryan looks and no armband who was willing on your behalf to join the long lines of
Poles in front of the Reich Credit Bank.
Pfefferberg and a young Zionist friend gathered from ghetto residents some hundreds of
thousands of z@loty in the proscribed denominations, went off with a suitcase full of
notes, and came back with the approved Occupation currency, minus only the bribes
they'd had to pay to the Polish Blue Police at the gate.
That was the sort of policeman Pfefferberg was. Excellent by the standards of Chairman
Artur Rosenzweig; deplorable by the standards of Pomorska.
Oskar visited the ghetto in April--both from curiosity and to speak to a jeweler he (<font color='blue'><b>jeweler</b></font>) had
commissioned to make two rings. He (<font color='blue'><b>jeweler</b></font>) found it crammed beyond what he (<font color='blue'><b>jeweler</b></font>) had imagined--
two families to a room unless you were lucky enough to know someone in the Judenrat.
There was a smell of clogged plumbing, but the women held off typhus by arduous
scrubbing and by boiling clothes in courtyards. <div class="bookquote">``Things are changing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the jeweler</b></font>)</div>the jeweler
confided in Oskar. <div class="bookquote">``The OD have been issued truncheons.''  (<font color='red'><b>Governor</b></font>)</div>As the administration of the
ghetto, like that of all ghettos in Poland, had passed from the control of Governor Frank
to that of Gestapo Section 4B, the final authority for all Jewish matters in Cracow was
now SS Oberf@uhrer Julian Scherner, a hearty man of somewhere between forty-five
and fifty, who in civilian clothes and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) baldness and thick lenses looked like a
nondescript bureaucrat. Oskar had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) at German cocktail parties. Scherner talked a
great deal--not about the war but about business and investment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) was the sort of
functionary who abounded in the middle ranks of the SS, a sport, interested in liquor,
women, and confiscated goods. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) could sometimes be discovered wearing the smirk of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) unexpected power like a childish jam stain in the corner of the mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) was always
convivial and dependably heartless. Oskar could tell that Scherner favored working the
Jews rather than killing them, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) would bend rules for the sake of profit, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>)
would fulfill the general drift of SS policy, however that might develop.
Oskar had remembered the police chief last Christmas, sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) half a dozen bottles
of cognac. Now that the man's power had expanded, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would rate more this year.
It was because of this shift of power--the SS becoming
not simply the arm of policy but the makers of it as
well--that beneath the high June sun the OD was
taking on a new nature. Oskar, merely
by driving past the ghetto, became familiar with a
new figure, a former glazier named Symche
Spira, the new force in the OD. Spira was of
Orthodox background and by personal history as
well as temperament despised the Europeanized
Jewish liberals who were still found on the
Judenrat Council. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) orders not
from Artur Rosenzweig but from
Untersturmf@uhrer Brandt and SS
headquarters across the river. From his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) conferences with Brandt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) returned to the ghetto
with increased knowingness and power. Brandt had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) to set up and lead a
Political Section OD, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) recruited various of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) friends for it. Their uniform ceased
to be the cap and armband and became instead gray shirt, cavalry breeches, Sam Browne
belt, and shiny SS boots.
Spira's Political Section would go beyond the demands of grudging cooperation and
would be full of venal men, men with complexes, with close-held grudges about the
social and intellectual slights they'd received in earlier days from respectable middleclass
Jewry.
Apart from Spira, there were Szymon Spitz and
Marcel Zellinger, Ignacy Diamond,
David Gutter the salesman, Forster and
Gr@uner and Landau. They settled in to a career of extortion and of making out for the
SS lists of unsatisfactory or seditious ghetto dwellers.
Poldek Pfefferberg now wanted to escape the force. There was a rumor that the Gestapo
would make all OD men swear an oath to the F@uhrer, after which they would have no
grounds for disobedience. Poldek did not want to share a profession with gray-shirted
Spira or with Spitz and Zellinger, the makers of lists. He (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) went down the street to the
hospital at the corner of Wegierska to speak to a gentle physician named Alexander
Biberstein, the official physician to the Judenrat. The doctor's brother Marek had been
that first president of the Council and was presently doing time in mournful Montelupich
prison for currency violations and attempting to bribe officials.
Pfefferberg begged Biberstein to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>) a medical certificate so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>) could leave the
OD. It was difficult, Biberstein said.
Pfefferberg did not even look sick. It would be impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>) to feign high blood
pressure. Dr. Biberstein instructed him (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>) in the symptoms of a bad back. Pfefferberg took
to reporting for duty severely stooped and using a cane.
Spira was outraged. When Pfefferberg had first asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>) about leaving the OD, the
police chief had pronounced--like a commander of some palace guard --that the only
way out was on your shield. Inside the ghetto, Spira and his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) infantile friends were playing
a game of Elite Corps. They were the Foreign Legion; they were the praetorians.
<div class="bookquote">``We'll send you to the Gestapo doctor,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Spira/Symche Spira/Symche</b></font>)</div>screamed Spira.
Biberstein, who had been aware of the shame in young Pfefferberg, had tutored him (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>)
well. Poldek survived the Gestapo doctor's inspection and was discharged from the OD
as suffering from an ailment likely to inhibit his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) good performance in crowd control.
Spira, saying goodbye to officer Pfefferberg, expressed a contemptuous enmity. The next
day, Germany invaded Russia.
Oskar heard the news illicitly on the BBC and knew that the Madagascar Plan was
finished now. It would be years before there were ships for a solution like that. Oskar
sensed that the event changed the essence of SS planning, for everywhere now the
economists, the engineers, the planners of movements of people, the policemen of every
stripe put on the mental habits appropriate not only to a long war, but to a more
systematic pursuit of a racially impeccable empire.

<p/>CHAPTER 11
In an alley off Lipowa, its rear pointing toward the workshop of Schindler's enamel plant,
stood the German Box Factory. Oskar Schindler, always restless and hungry for
company, used to stroll over there sometimes and chat with the Treuh@ander, Ernst
Kuhnpast, or to the former owner and unofficial manager, Szymon Jereth. Jereth's Box
Factory had become the German Box Factory two years back according to the usual
arrangement--no fees being paid, no documents to which he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) was signatory having been
drawn up.
The injustice of that did not particularly worry Jereth anymore. It had happened to most
of the people he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) knew. What worried him (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) was the ghetto. The fights in the kitchens, the
pitiless communality of life there, the stench of bodies, the lice that jumped onto your suit
from the greasy jacket of the man whose shoulder you brushed on the stairs. Mrs. Jereth,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told Oskar, was deeply depressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jereth</b></font>)'d always been used to nice things; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jereth</b></font>)'d come
from a good family in Kleparz, north of Cracow. And when you think, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told Oskar, that
with all the pineboard I could build myself a place there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) pointed to the wasteland
behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) factory. Workers played football there, vast, hard-running games in plentiful
space. Most of it belonged to Oskar's factory, the rest to a Polish couple named Bielski.
But Oskar did not point that out to poor Jereth, or say either that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) too had been
preoccupied by that vacant space. Oskar was more interested in the implied offer of
lumber. You can <div class="bookquote">``alienate''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as much pineboard as that? You know, said Jereth, it's only a
matter of paperwork.
They stood together at Jereth's office window, considering the wasteland. From the
workshop came the sound of hammering and whining power saws. I would hate to lose
contact with this place, Jereth told Oskar. I would hate just to vanish into some labor
camp and have to wonder from a distance what the damn fools were doing here. You can
understand that, surely, Herr Schindler?
A man like Jereth could not foresee any deliverance. The German armies seemed to be
enjoying limitless success in Russia, and even the BBC was having trouble believing that
they were advancing into a fatal salient. The Armament Inspectorate orders for field
kitchenware kept turning up on Oskar's desk, sent on with the compliments of General
Julius Schindler scribbled at the bottom of the covering letters, accompanied by the
telephoned best wishes of sundry junior officers. Oskar accepted the orders and the
congratulations in their own right, but took a contradictory joy from the rash letters his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
father was writing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to celebrate their reconciliation. It won't last, said Schindler
senior. The man -LSB-Hitler-RSB- isn't meant to last. America will come down on him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) in the end.
And the Russians? My God, did anyone ever take the trouble to point out to the dictator
just how many godless barbarians there are over there? Oskar, smiling over the letters,
was not troubled by the conflicting pleasures--the commercial exhilaration of the
Armaments Inspectorate contracts and the more intimate delight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) father's
subversive letters. Oskar sent Hans a monthly bank draft of 1,000 RM. in honor of filial
love and sedition, and for the joy of largesse.
It was a fast and, still, almost a painless year. Longer hours than Schindler had ever
worked, parties at the Cracovia, drinking bouts at the jazz club, visits to the gorgeous
Klonowska's apartment. When the leaves began to fall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) wondered where the year had
gone. The impression of vanished time was augmented by the late summer and now by
autumn rains earlier than usual. The asymmetric seasons would, by favoring the Soviets,
affect the lives of all Europeans. But to Herr Oskar Schindler in Lipowa Street, weather
was still simply weather. Then, in the butt end of 1941, Oskar found himself under
arrest. Someone--one of the Polish shipping clerks, one of the German technicians in the
munitions section, you couldn't tell--had denounced him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), had gone to Pomorska Street
and given information. Two plainclothes Gestapo men drove up Lipowa Street one
morning and blocked the entrance with their Mercedes as if they intended to bring all
commerce at Emalia to an end. Upstairs, facing Oskar, they produced warrants entitling
them to take all his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) business records with them. But they did not seem to have any
commercial training. <div class="bookquote">``Exactly what books do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Schindler asked them.
<div class="bookquote">``Cashbooks,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one.
<div class="bookquote">``Your main ledgers,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other.
It was a relaxed arrest; they chatted to Klonowska while Oskar himself went to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
cash journal and accounts ledger. Oskar was permitted time to scribble down a few
names on a pad, supposedly the names of associates with whom Oskar had appointments
which must now be cancelled. Klonowska understood, though, that they were a list of
people to be approached for help in bailing him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) out.
The first name on the list was that of
Oberf@uhrer Julian Scherner; the
second, that of Martin Plathe of the Abwehr in Breslau. That would be a long-distance
call. The third name belonged to the supervisor of the Ostfaser works, the drunken Army
veteran Franz Bosch on whom Schindler had settled quantities of illegal kitchenware.
Leaning over Klonowska's shoulder, over her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) piled-up flaxen hair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) underlined Bosch's
name. A man of influence, Bosch knew and advised every high official who played the
black market in Cracow. And Oskar knew that this arrest had to do with the black market,
whose danger was that you could always find officials ready to be bribed, but you could
never predict the jealousy of one of your employees.
The fourth name on the list was that of the German chairman of Ferrum AG of
Sosnowiec, the company from which Herr Schindler bought his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) steel. These names were
a comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) as the Gestapo Mercedes carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) to Pomorska Street, a kilometer or
so west of the Centrum. They were a guarantee that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) would not vanish into the system
without a trace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was not, therefore, as defenseless as the 1,000 ghetto dwellers who
had been rounded up according to Symche Spira's lists and marched beneath the frosty
stars of Advent to the cattle cars at Prokocim Station. Oskar knew some heavy guns.
The SS complex in Cracow was an
immense modern building, humorless, but not as
portentous as the Montelupich prison. Yet
even if you disbelieved the rumors of torture
attached to the place, the building confused the
arrestee as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) entered by its size, its
Kafkaesque corridors, by the numb threat of the
departmental names painted on the doors. Here you
could find the SS Main Office, the headquarters
of the Order Police, of Kripo, Sipo and
Gestapo, of SS Economy and Administration,
of Personnel, of Jewish Affairs, of Race
and Resettlement, of the SS Court, of
Operations, of SS Service, of the
Reichskommissariat for the Strengthening of Germandom, of the Welfare Office for
Ethnic Germans.
Somewhere in that hive a middle-aged Gestapo man, who seemed to have a more exact
knowledge of accountancy than the arresting officers, began interviewing Oskar. The
man's manner was half-amused, like a customs official who finds that a passenger
suspected of currency smuggling is really smuggling house plants for an aunt. He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) told
Oskar that all the enterprises involved in war production were under scrutiny. Oskar did
not believe it but said nothing. Herr Schindler could understand, the Gestapo man told
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), that businesses supplying the war effort had a moral duty to devote all their product
to that great enterprise--and to desist from undermining the economy of the Government
General by irregular dealings.
Oskar murmured away in that peculiar rumble of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) which could at the same time
contain threat and bonhomie. <div class="bookquote">``Do you imply, Herr Wachtmeister, that there are reports
that my factory does not fulfill its quotas?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You live very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, but with a concessive smile, and as if that were all
right, it was acceptable for important industrialists to live well. And anyone who lives
well, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pointed out ... well, we have to be sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) standard of living derives entirely
from legitimate contracts.
Oskar beamed at the Gestapo man. <div class="bookquote">``Whoever gave you my name,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``is a fool and
is wasting your time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who's the plant manager of DEF?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gestapo/Mercedes/Gestapo Mercedes</b></font>)</div>asked the Gestapo man, ignoring this.
<div class="bookquote">``Abraham Bankier.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A Jew?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course. The business used to belong to relatives of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bankier</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gestapo/Mercedes/Gestapo Mercedes</b></font>)</div>These records might be adequate, said the Gestapo man. But if they wanted more, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
presumed Herr Bankier could supply it.
<div class="bookquote">``You mean you're going to detain me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>asked Oskar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) began to laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I want to tell
you now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``when Oberf@uhrer Scherner and I are laughing about all this over a
drink, I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bankier</b></font>) that you treated me with the utmost courtesy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The two who had made the arrest took him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to the second floor, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was searched
and permitted to keep cigarettes and 100 z@l. to buy small luxuries. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was locked
in a bedroom-- one of the best they had, Oskar surmised, equipped with a washbasin and
toilet and dusty draperies at the barred window--the sort of room they kept dignitaries in
while interrogating them. If the dignitary was released, he (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) could not complain about a
room like this, any more than he (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) could enthuse over it. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) was found to be
treacherous, seditious, or an economic criminal, then, as if the floor of this room opened
like a trapdoor, he (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>)'d find himself waiting in an interrogation cell in the basement, sitting
motionless and bleeding in one of the series of stalls they called tramways, looking ahead
to Montelupich, where prisoners were hanged in their cells. Oskar considered the door.
Whoever lays a hand on me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) promised himself, I'll have him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) sent to Russia.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was bad at waiting. After an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) knocked at the door from the inside and gave the
Waffen SS man who answered 50 z@l. to buy him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a bottle of vodka. It was, of course,
three times the price of liquor, but that was Oskar's method. Later in the day, by
arrangement between Klonowska and Ingrid, a bag of toiletries, books, and pajamas
arrived. An excellent meal was brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) with a half-bottle of Hungarian wine, and
no one came to disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) or ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) a question. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) presumed that the accountant was
still slaving over the Emalia books. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would have enjoyed a radio on which to listen to
the BBC news from Russia, the Far East, and the newly combatant United States, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
had the feeling that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) jailers they might bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) hoped the
Gestapo had not moved into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) apartment on Straszewskiego, to assess the furnishings
and Ingrid's jewelry. But by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) fell asleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d got to the stage where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was
looking forward to facing interrogators.
In the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was brought a good breakfast-- herring, cheese, eggs, rolls, coffee--
and still no one bothered him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). And then the middle-aged SS auditor, holding both the
cash journal and the accounts ledger, came to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>).
The auditor wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) good morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had had a comfortable night. There
had not been time to conduct more than a cursory examination of Herr Schindler's
records, but it had been decided that a gentleman who stood so high in the opinion of so
many people influential in the war effort need not be too closely looked at for the
moment. We have, said the SS man, received certain telephone calls. ... Oskar was
convinced, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) thanked the man, that the acquittal was temporary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) received the
ledgers and got his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) money handed back in full at the reception desk.
Downstairs, Klonowska was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), radiant. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) liaison work had yielded this
result, Schindler coming forth from the death house in his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) double-breasted suit and
without a scratch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) to the Adler, which they had let her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) park inside the gate.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) ridiculous poodle sat on the back seat.

<p/>CHAPTER 12
The child arrived at the Dresners', on the eastern side of the ghetto, late in the afternoon.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) had been returned to Cracow by the Polish couple who had been taking care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) in
the country. They had been able to talk the Polish Blue Police at the ghetto gate into
allowing them entry on business, and the child passed as theirs.
They were decent people, and shamefaced at having brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) up to Cracow and the
ghetto from the countryside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) was a dear girl; they were attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>). But you
couldn't keep a Jewish child in the countryside anymore. The municipal authorities--
never mind the SS--WERE offering sums of 500 z@l. and upward for every Jew
betrayed. It was one's neighbors. You couldn't trust your neighbors. And then not only
would the child be in trouble, we'd all be. My God, there were areas where the peasants
went out hunting Jews with scythes and sickles.
The child didn't seem to suffer too much from whatever squalors the ghetto now imposed
on her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) sat at a little table among screens of damp clothing and fastidiously ate the
heel of bread Mrs. Dresner gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) accepted whatever endearments the women
sharing the kitchen happened to utter. Mrs. Dresner noticed how strangely guarded the
child was in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) answers.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) vanities, though, and like most
three-year-olds a passionately preferred
color. Red. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) sat there in red cap, red
coat, small red boots. The peasants had
indulged her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) passion.
Mrs. Dresner made conversation by talking about the child's real parents. They too had
been living-- in fact, hiding--in the countryside. But, said Mrs. Dresner, they were going
to come and join everyone here in Cracow soon. The child nodded, but it didn't seem to
be shyness that kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) quiet.
In January her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) parents had been rounded up
according to a list supplied to the SS by Spira, and
while being marched to Prokocim Station had passed
a crowd of jeering Poles--<div class="bookquote">``Bye-bye,
Jews.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poles</b></font>)</div>They had dodged out of the column just like
two decent Polish citizens crossing the
street to watch the deportation of social
enemies, and had joined the crowd, jeered a little themselves, and then strolled off into
the countryside around that outer suburb.
Now they too were finding life no safer out there and intended to sneak back into Cracow
during the summer. The mother of <div class="bookquote">``Redcap,''  (<font color='red'><b>The mother</b></font>)</div>as the Dresner boys nicknamed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) as soon
as they got home with the work details from the city, was a first cousin of Mrs. Dresner's.
Soon Mrs. Dresner's daughter, young
Danka, also got home from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) work as a cleaning woman at the Luftwaffe air base.
Danka was going on fourteen, tall enough to have the Kennkarte -LRB-labor card-RRB- enabling her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>)
to work outside the ghetto. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) enthused over the noncommittal child. <div class="bookquote">``Genia, I know
your mother, Eva. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) and I used to go shopping for dresses together, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>)'d buy me
cakes at the patisserie in Bracka Street.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div>The child kept to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) seat, did not smile, looked ahead. <div class="bookquote">``Madam, you're mistaken. My
mother's name is not Eva. It's Jasha.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) went on naming the names in the fictional
Polish genealogy in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) parents and the peasants had schooled her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) in case the Blue
Police or the SS ever questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>). The family frowned at each other, brought to a
standstill by the unusual cunning of the child, finding it obscene but not wanting to
undermine it, since it might, before the week was out, be essential survival equipment.
At suppertime Idek Schindel, the child's uncle, a young doctor at the ghetto hospital in
Wegierska Street, arrived. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was the sort of whimsical, half-teasing, and infatuated
uncle a child needs. At the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), Genia became a child, getting down off her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) chair
to rush at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) were here, calling these people cousins, then they were cousins. You
could admit now that you had a mother named Eva and that your grandparents weren't
really named Ludwik and Sophia.
Then Mr. Juda Dresner, purchasing officer of the Bosch plant, arrived home and the
company was complete.
April 28 was Schindler's birthday, and in
1942 he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) celebrated it like a child of the spring,
loudly, profligately. It was a big day at
DEF. The Herr Direktor brought in rare
white bread, regardless of expense, to be served with the noonday soup. The festivity
spread into the outer office and to the workshops out back. Oskar Schindler, industrialist,
was celebrating the general succulence of life. This, his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) thirty-fourth birthday, began
early at Emalia. Schindler signaled it by walking through the outer office carrying three
bottles of cognac under his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) arm to share with the engineers, the accountants, the
draftsmen. Office workers in Accounts and Personnel had handfuls of cigarettes thrust at
them, and by midmorning the handouts had spread to the factory floor. A cake was
brought in from a patisserie, and Oskar cut it on Klonowska's desk. Delegations of
Jewish and Polish workers began to enter the office to congratulate him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) heartily
kissed a girl named Kucharska, whose father had figured in the Polish parliament before
the war. And then the Jewish girls came up, and the men shaking hands, even Stern
getting there somehow from the Progress Works where he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) was now employed, to take
Oskar's hand formally and find himself wrapped up in a rib-cracking embrace.
That afternoon someone, perhaps the same malcontent as last time, contacted Pomorska
and denounced Schindler for his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) racial improprieties. His (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) ledgers might stand up to
scrutiny, but no one could deny he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was a <div class="bookquote">``Jew-kisser.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The manner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) arrest seemed more professional than the last. On the morning of the
29th, a Mercedes blocked the factory entrance and two Gestapo men, seeming somehow
surer of their ground than the last two, met him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) crossing the factory yard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was
charged, they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>), with breaking the provisions of the Race and Resettlement Act.
They wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) to come with them. And no, there was no need for him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
office first.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you have a warrant?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) asked them.
<div class="bookquote">``We don't need one,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) smiled at them. The gentlemen should understand that if they took him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) away without
a warrant, they would come to regret it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) said it lightly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) could tell by their demeanor that the level of threat in them had
firmed and focused since last year's half-comic detention. Last time the conversation at
Pomorska had been about economic matters and whether they had been breached. This
time you were dealing with grotesque law, the law of the lower guts, edicts from the
black side of the brain. Serious stuff.
<div class="bookquote">``We will have to risk regret,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>one of the two told him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) assessed their assurance, their perilous indifference to him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>), a man of assets, newly
turned thirty-four. <div class="bookquote">``On a spring morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) told them, <div class="bookquote">``I can spare a few hours for
driving.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) comforted himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) would again be put into one of those urbane cells at
Pomorska. But when they turned right up Kolejowa, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) knew that this time it would be
Montelupich prison.
<div class="bookquote">``I shall wish to speak to a lawyer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) told them.
<div class="bookquote">``In time,''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>said the driver.
Oskar had it on the reasonable word of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) drinking companions that the
Jagiellonian Institute of Anatomy received corpses from Montelupich.
The wall of the place stretched a long block, and the ominous sameness of the windows
of the third and fourth floors could be seen from the back seat of the Gestapo Mercedes.
Inside the front gate and through the archway they came to an office where the SS clerk
spoke in whispers, as if raised voices would set up head-splitting echoes along the narrow
corridors. They took his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) cash, but told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) it would be given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) during his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
imprisonment at a rate of 50 z@l. a day. No, the arresting officers told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), it was not yet
time for him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to call a lawyer.
Then they left, and in the corridor, under guard, he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) listened for the traces of screams
which might, in this convent hush, spill out through the cracks of the Judas windows in
the walls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Judas</b></font>) was led down a flight of stairs into a claustrophobic tunnel and past a string
of locked cells, one with an open grille. Some half-dozen prisoners in shirt sleeves sat
there, each in a separate stall, facing the rear wall so that their features could not be seen.
Oskar noticed a torn ear. And someone was sniffling but knew better than to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
nose.
Klonowska, Klonowska, are you making your telephone calls, my love?
They opened a cell for him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) went in.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had felt a minor anxiety that the place
might be crowded. But there was only one other
prisoner in the cell, a soldier wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
greatcoat up around his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) ears for warmth and seated on
one of the two low wooden bed frames, each with its
pallet. There were no washbasins, of course. A
water bucket and a waste bucket. And what
proved to be a Waffen SS
Standartenf@uhrer -LRB-an SS rank
equivalent to colonel-RRB- wearing a slight stubble, a stale, unbuttoned shirt under the
overcoat, and muddy boots.
<div class="bookquote">``Welcome, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>said the officer with a crooked grin, raising one hand to Oskar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was a
handsome fellow, a few years older than Oskar. The odds were in favor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) being a
plant. But one wondered why they had put him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) in uniform and provided him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) with such
exalted rank. Oskar looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) watch, sat, stood, looked up at the high windows. A
little light from the exercise yards filtered in, but it was not the sort of window you could
lean against and relieve the intimacy of the two close bunks, of sitting hands on knees
facing each other.
In the end they began to talk. Oskar was very wary, but the Standartenf@uhrer chattered
wildly. What was his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) name? Philip was his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) name. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) didn't think gentlemen should give
their second names in prison. Besides, it was time people got down to first names. If we'd
all got down to first names earlier, we'd be a happier race now.
Oskar concluded that if the man was not a plant, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had had some sort of
breakdown, was perhaps suffering shell shock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d been campaigning in southern
Russia, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) battalion had helped hang on to Novgorod all winter. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had got
leave to visit a Polish girlfriend in Cracow and they had, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) words, <div class="bookquote">``lost themselves in
each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>a girlfriend</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had been arrested in her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) apartment three days after his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) leave expired.
<div class="bookquote">``I suppose I decided,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip</b></font>)</div>said Philip,
<div class="bookquote">``not to be too damn exact about dates when I
saw the way the other bastards'' (<font color='red'><b>Philip</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) waved a hand
at the roof, indicating the structure around him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), the
SS planners, the accountants, the bureaucrats
--<div class="bookquote">``when I saw the way they lived. It wasn't as if I deliberately decided to go absent
without leave. But I just felt I was owed a certain damn latitude.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the bureaucrats</b></font>)</div>Oskar asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) rather be in Pomorska Street. No, said Philip, I'd rather be
here. Pomorska looked more like a hotel. But the bastards had a death cell there, full of
shining chromium bars. But that aside, what had Herr Oskar done?
<div class="bookquote">``I kissed a Jewish girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar.
<div class="bookquote">``An employee of mine. So it's
alleged.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Philip</b></font>)</div>Philip began to hoot at this. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh!
Did your prick drop off?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Philip</b></font>)</div>All afternoon Standartenf@uhrer Philip
continued to condemn the SS. Thieves and orgiasts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) couldn't believe it. The
money some of the bastards made. They started so incorruptible too. They would kill
some poor bloody Pole for smuggling a kilo of bacon while they lived like goddamn
Hanseatic barons.
Oskar behaved as if it were all news to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), as if the idea of venality among the
Reichf@uhrers was a painful assault on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) provincial Sudetendeutsch innocence which
had caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to forget himself and caress a Jewish girl. At last Philip, worn out by his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
outrage, took a nap.
Oskar wanted a drink. A certain measure of liquor would help speed time, make the
Standartenf@uhrer better company if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was not a plant and more fallible if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was.
Oskar took out a 10-z@l. note and wrote down names on it and telephone numbers; more
names than last time: a dozen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) took out another four notes, crumpled them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
hands and went to the door and knocked at the Judas window. An SS NCO turned up--a
grave middle-aged face staring in at him (<font color='blue'><b>Judas</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Judas</b></font>) didn't look like a man who exercised Poles
to death or ruptured kidneys with his (<font color='blue'><b>Judas</b></font>) boots, but of course, that was one of the strengths of
torture: you didn't expect it from a man whose features were those of someone's country
uncle.
Was it possible to order five bottles of
vodka? Oskar asked. Five bottles, sir?
said the NCO. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) might have been advising a young, callow drinker uncertain of
quantities. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was also pensive, however, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) were considering reporting Oskar to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) superiors. The general and I, said Oskar, would appreciate a bottle apiece to stimulate
conversation. You and your colleagues please accept the rest with my compliments. I
presume also, said Oskar, that a man of your authority has power to make routine
telephone calls on behalf of a prisoner.
You'll see the telephone numbers there ... yes, on the note. You don't have to call them
all yourself. But give them to my secretary, eh? Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)'s the first on the list.
These are very influential people, murmured the SS NCO.
You're a damn fool, Philip told
Oskar. They'll shoot you for trying to corrupt their guards.
Oskar slumped, apparently casual.
It's as stupid as kissing a Jewess, said
Philip.
We'll see, said Oskar. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was frightened. At last the NCO came back and brought,
together with the two bottles, a parcel of clean shirts and underwear, some books, and a
bottle of wine, packed at the apartment in Straszewskiego Street by Ingrid and delivered
to the Montelupich gate. Philip and Oskar had a pleasant enough evening together,
though at one time a guard pounded on the steel door and demanded that they stop
singing. And even then, as the liquor added spaciousness to the cell and an unexpected
cogency to the Standartenf@uhrer's ravings, Schindler was listening for remote screams
from upstairs or for the button-clicking Morse of some hopeless prisoner in the next cell.
Only once did the true nature of the place dilute the effectiveness of the vodka. Next to
his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) cot, partially obscured by the pallet, Philip discovered a minute statement in red
pencil. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spent some idle moments deciphering it--not doing so well, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) Polish much
slower than Oskar's.
``''My God,'''' he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) translated,
``''how they beat me!<div class="bookquote">'' Well, it's a
wonderful world, my friend Oskar. Isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>In the morning Schindler woke clearheaded. Hangovers had never plagued him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
wondered why other people made such a fuss about them. But Philip was white-faced
and depressed. During the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was taken away and came back to collect his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
belongings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was to face a court-martial that afternoon, but had been given a new
assignment at a training school in Stutthof, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) presumed they didn't intend to shoot
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) for desertion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) greatcoat from his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cot and went off to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
Polish dalliance.
Alone, Oskar spent the day reading a Karl
May book Ingrid had sent and, in the afternoon,
speaking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) lawyer, a Sudetendeutscher
who'd opened a practice in civil law in
Cracow two years before. Oskar was comforted by the
interview. The cause of the arrest was certainly as
stated; they weren't using his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
transracial caresses as a pretext to hold
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) while they investigated his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) affairs. <div class="bookquote">``But it will probably come to the SS Court and
you'll be asked why you aren't in the Army.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The reason is obvious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm an essential war producer. You can get General Schindler to say so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar was a slow reader and savored the Karl May book--the hunter and the Indian sage
in the American wilderness--a relationship of decency. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) did not rush the reading, in
any case. It could be a week before he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) came to court. The lawyer expected that there
would be a speech by the president of the court about conduct unbecoming a member of
the German race and then there would be a substantial fine. So be it. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>)'d leave court a
more cautious man.
On the fifth morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had already drunk the half-liter of black ersatz coffee they'd
given him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) for breakfast when an NCO and two guards came for him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>). Past the mute doors
he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was taken upstairs to one of the front offices. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) found there a man he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>)'d met at
cocktail parties, Obersturmbannf@uhrer Rolf Czurda, head of the Cracow SD. Czurda
looked like a businessman in his (<font color='blue'><b>Czurda</b></font>) good suit. <div class="bookquote">``Oskar, Oskar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Czurda/Rolf Czurda/Rolf</b></font>)</div>said Czurda like an old
friend reproving. <div class="bookquote">``We give you those Jewish girls at five marks a day. You should kiss
us, not them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar explained that it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) birthday.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d been impetuous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d been drinking. Czurda shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Czurda</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I never knew you
were such a big-timer, Oskar,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Czurda</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Calls from as far away as Breslau, from our
friends in the Abwehr. Of course it would be ridiculous to keep you from your work just
because you felt up some Jewess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're very understanding, Herr
Obersturmbannf@uhrer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar,
feeling the request for some sort of gratuity building up in Czurda. <div class="bookquote">``If ever I'm in a
position to return your liberal gesture ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Czurda/Rolf Czurda/Rolf</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``As a matter of fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Czurda/Rolf Czurda/Rolf</b></font>)</div>said Czurda, <div class="bookquote">``I have an
old aunt whose flat has been bombed out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Czurda/Rolf Czurda/Rolf</b></font>)</div>Yet another old aunt. Schindler made a
compassionate click with his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) tongue and said that a
representative of chief Czurda would be
welcome any time in Lipowa Street
to make a selection from the range of products turned out there. But it did not do to let
men like Czurda think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Czurda</b></font>) release as an absolute favor--and of the kitchenware as the
least that the luckily released prisoner could offer. When Czurda said he (<font color='blue'><b>Czurda</b></font>) could go, Oskar
objected.
<div class="bookquote">``I can't very well just call my car, Herr
Obersturmbannf@uhrer. After all, my
fuel resources are limited.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Czurda/Rolf Czurda/Rolf</b></font>)</div>Czurda asked if Herr Schindler expected the SD to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Czurda</b></font>) home.
Oskar shrugged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) did live on the far side of the city, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said. It was a long way to walk.
Czurda laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Oskar, I'll have one of
my own drivers take you back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>But when the limousine was ready, engine running, at the bottom of the main steps, and
Schindler, glancing at the blank windows above him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>), wanted a sign from that other
republic, the realm of torture, of unconditional imprisonment--the hell beyond bars of
those who had no pots and pans to barter--Rolf Czurda detained him (<font color='blue'><b>Czurda</b></font>) by the elbow.
<div class="bookquote">``Jokes aside, Oskar, my dear fellow.
You'd be a fool if you got a real taste for some little Jewish skirt. They don't have a
future, Oskar. That's not just old-fashioned Jew-hate talking, I assure you. It's policy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER 13
Even that summer, people inside the walls were clinging to the idea of the ghetto as a
small but permanent realm. The idea had been easy enough to credit during 1941. There
had been a post office; there had even been ghetto postage stamps. There had been a
ghetto newspaper, even though it contained little else than edicts from the Wawel and
Pomorska Street. A restaurant had been permitted in Lw@owska Street: Foerster's
Restaurant, where the Rosner brothers, back from the perils of the countryside and the
changeable passions of the peasants, played the violin and the accordion. It had seemed
for a brief time that schooling would proceed here in formal classrooms, that orchestras
would gather and regularly perform, that Jewish life would be communicated like a
benign organism along the streets, from artisan to artisan, from scholar to scholar. It had
not yet been demonstrated finally by the SS bureaucrats of Pomorska Street that the idea
of that sort of ghetto was to be considered not simply a whimsy but an insult to the
rational direction of history.
So when Untersturmf@uhrer Brandt had Judenrat president Artur Rosenzweig around to
Pomorska for a beating with the handle of a riding crop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandt</b></font>) was trying to correct the
man's incurable vision of the ghetto as a region of permanent residence. The ghetto was a
depot, a siding, a walled bus station. Anything that would have encouraged the opposite
view had, by 1942, been abolished.
So it was different here from the ghettos old people remembered even affectionately.
Music was no profession here. There were no professions. Henry Rosner went to work in
the Luftwaffe mess at the air base. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) met a young German chefstmanager named
Richard, a laughing boy hiding, as a chef can, from the history of the twentieth century
among the elements of cuisine and bar management. He (<font color='blue'><b>chef</b></font>) and Henry Rosner got on so well
that Richard would send the violinist across town to pick up the Luftwaffe Catering
Corps pay--you couldn't trust a German, said Richard; the last one had run off to
Hungary with the payroll.
Richard, like any barman worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) station,
heard things and attracted the affection of
officials. On the first day of June, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) came
to the ghetto with his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) girlfriend, a Volksdeutsche
girl wearing a sweeping cape--which, on account of the
June showers, didn't seem too excessive
a garment. Through his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) profession, Richard knew a
number of policemen, including
Wachtmeister Oswald Bosko, and had no
trouble being admitted to the ghetto, even though it was
officially out-of-bounds to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). Once inside the
gate, Richard crossed Plac Zgody and found
Henry Rosner's address. Henry was
surprised to see them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had left Richard
at the mess only a few hours before, yet here
he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) girl, both dressed as if for a formal
visit. It reinforced for Henry the strangeness of the
season. For the past two days, ghetto people had been
lining up at the old Polish Savings Bank
building in J@ozefi@nska Street for the new
identity cards. To your yellow
Kennkarte with its sepia passport
photograph and its large blue J, the
German clerks now attached--if you were lucky-- a blue sticker. People could be seen to
leave the bank waving their cards with the Blauschein attached as if it proved their right
to breathe, their permanent validity. Workers at the Luftwaffe mess, the Wehrmacht
garage, at the Madritsch works, at Oskar Schindler's Emalia, at the Progress factory all
had no trouble getting the Blauschein. But those who were refused it felt that their
citizenship even of the ghetto was under question.
Richard said that young Olek Rosner should come and stay with his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) girlfriend at her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>)
apartment. You could tell that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)'d heard something in the mess. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) can't just walk out
the gate, said Henry. It's fixed with Bosko, said Richard.
Henry and Manci were hesitant and consulted with
each other as the girl in the cape promised
to fatten Olek up on chocolate. An
Aktion? Henry Rosner asked in a
murmur. Is there going to be an Aktion? Richard answered with a question. You've got
your Blauschein? he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) asked. Of course, said Henry. And Manci? Manci too. But Olek
hasn't, said Richard. In the drizzling dusk, Olek Rosner, only child, newly six years old,
walked out of the ghetto under the cape of Richard the chef's girlfriend. Had some
policeman bothered to lift the cape, both Richard and the girl could have been shot for
their friendly subterfuge. Olek too would vanish. In the childless corner of their room, the
Rosners hoped they'd been wise.
Poldek Pfefferberg, runner for Oskar
Schindler, had earlier in the year been ordered to begin tutoring the children of Symche
Spira, exalted glazier, chief of the OD.
It was a contemptuous summons, as if Spira were saying, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, we know you're not fit
for man's work, but at least you can pass on to my kids some of the benefits of your
education.''  (<font color='red'><b>Spira/Symche Spira/Symche</b></font>)</div>Pfefferberg amused Schindler with stories of the tutorial sessions at
Symche's house. The police chief was one of the few Jews to have an entire floor to
himself. There, amid two-dimensional paintings of nineteenth-century rabbis, Symche
paced, listening to the instruction Pfefferberg gave, seeming to want to see knowledge,
like petunias, sprout from his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) children's ears. A man of destiny with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand hooked
inside his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jacket, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed that this Napoleonic mannerism was a gesture universal to
men of influence.
Symche's wife was a shadowy woman, a little bemused by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's unexpected
power, perhaps a little excluded by old friends. The children, a boy of about twelve and a
girl of fourteen, were biddable but no great scholars.
In any case, when Pfefferberg went to the Polish Savings Bank he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) expected to be given
the Blauschein without any trouble. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was sure his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) labor with the Spira children would
be counted as essential work. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) yellow card identified him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as a HIGH SCHOOL
PROFESSOR, and in a rational world as yet only partly turned upside down, it was an
honorable label.
The clerks refused to give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the sticker. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) argued with them and wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
should appeal to Oskar or to Herr Szepessi, the Austrian bureaucrat who ran the German
Labor Office down the street. Oskar had been asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) for a year to come to Emalia,
but Pfefferberg had always thought it would be too constricting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) illegal activities to
have full-time work.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) emerged from the bank building, details of the German Security Police, the Polish
Blue Police, and the political detail of the OD were at work on the pavements, inspecting
everyone's card and arresting those who did not have the sticker. A line of rejects,
hangdog men and women, already stood in the middle of J@ozefi@nska Street.
Pfefferberg affected his (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) Polish military bearing and explained that of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) had a
number of trades. But the Schupo he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) spoke to shook his (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) head, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Don't argue with
me; no Blauschein; you join that line. Understand, Jew?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Pfefferberg went and joined the line. Mila, the delicate, pretty wife he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>)'d married eighteen
months before, worked for Madritsch and already had her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) Blauschein. So there was that.
When the line had grown to more than a hundred, it was marched around the corner, past
the hospital, and into the yard of the old Optima confectionery plant. There hundreds
were already waiting. The early comers had taken the shady areas of what used to be the
stable, where the Optima horses used to be harnessed between the shafts of drays laden
with cr@emes and liqueur chocolates. It was not a rowdy group. There were professional
men, bankers like the Holzers, pharmacists and dentists. They stood in clusters, talking
quietly. The young pharmacist Bachner stood speaking to an old couple named Wohl.
There were many old people in here. The old and poor who depended on the Judenrat
ration. This summer the Judenrat itself, the distributor of food and even of space, had
been less equitable than it had been last. Nurses from the ghetto hospital moved among
these detainees with buckets of water, which was said to be good for stress and
disorientation. It was, in any case, just about the only medicine, other than some blackmarket
cyanide, that the hospital had to give. The old, the poor families from the shtetls,
took the water in restive silence.
Throughout the day, police of three varieties would enter the yard with lists, and lines of
people would be formed to be met at the gate of the yard by SS details and moved out to
the Prokocim Railway Station. In some people the urge rose to evade this next movement
by keeping to the far corners of the yard. But it was Pfefferberg's style to hang around the
gate, looking for some official to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) could make a claim. Perhaps Spira would be
there, dressed up like a movie actor and willing--with a little heavy-handed irony--to
release him (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>). In fact there stood by the gatekeeper's hut a sad-faced boy in an OD hat
studying a list, holding the corner of the page in delicate fingers.
Pfefferberg not only had served briefly with the
boy in the OD, but in the first year of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) teaching
career at Kosciuszko High School in
Podg@orze had taught his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sister.
The boy looked up. Panie Pfefferberg,
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) murmured with a respect from those vanished days. As if the yard were full of
practiced criminals, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked what Panie Pfefferberg was doing here.
It's nonsense, said Pfefferberg, but I
haven't got a Blauschein yet.
The boy shook his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head. Follow me, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) walked Pfefferberg to a senior
uniformed Schupo at the gate and saluted. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did not look heroic in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) funny OD cap
and with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) skinny, vulnerable neck. Later, Pfefferberg supposed that that had given him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
greater credibility.
<div class="bookquote">``This is Herr Pfefferberg from the
Judenrat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lied with a deft combination of respect and authority. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) has been visiting
some relatives.''  (<font color='red'><b>police</b></font>)</div>The Schupo seemed bored by the mass of police work proceeding in the
yard. Negligently he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) waved Pfefferberg out the gate. Pfefferberg had no time to thank
the boy or to reflect on the mystery of why a child with a skinny neck will lie for you
even unto death just because you taught his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sister how to use the Roman rings.
Pfefferberg rushed straight to the Labor
Office and broke into the waiting line. Behind the desk were Frauleins Skoda and
Knosalla, two hearty Sudeten German girls.
<div class="bookquote">``Liebchen, Liebchen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) told
Skoda, <div class="bookquote">``they want to take me away because I don't have the sticker. Look at me, I ask
you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Skoda</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was built like a bull, and had played hockey for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) country and belonged to the
Polish ski team.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Am I not exactly the sort of fellow you'd like to keep around here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Skoda</b></font>)</div>In spite of the crowds who'd given her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) no
rest all day, Skoda raised her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eyebrows and
failed to suppress a smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
Kennkarte. <div class="bookquote">``I can't help you, Herr
Pfefferberg,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``They didn't
give it to you, so I can't. A pity. ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you can give it to me, Liebchen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
insisted in a loud, seductive, soap-opera
voice. <div class="bookquote">``I have trades, Liebchen, I have
trades.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Skoda</b></font>)</div>Skoda said that only Herr Szepessi could help him (<font color='blue'><b>Szepessi</b></font>), and it was impossible to get
Pfefferberg in to see Szepessi. It would take days. <div class="bookquote">``But you will get me in, Liebchen,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pfefferberg/Poldek Pfefferberg/Poldek</b></font>)</div>Pfefferberg insisted. And she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did. That is where her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) reputation as a decent girl came
from, because she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) abstracted from the massive drift of policy and could, even on a
crowded day, respond to the individual face. A warty old man might not have done so
well with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), however.
Herr Szepessi, who also had a humane reputation even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Szepessi</b></font>) serviced the monstrous
machine, looked quickly at Pfefferberg's permit, murmuring, <div class="bookquote">``But we don't need gym
teachers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pfefferberg/Poldek Pfefferberg/Poldek</b></font>)</div>Pfefferberg had always refused Oskar's offers
of employment because he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) saw himself as an operator,
an individualist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) didn't want to work
long shifts for small pay over in dreary
Zablocie. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could see now that the
era of individuality was vanishing. People needed, as a staple of life, a trade. <div class="bookquote">``I'm a metal
polisher,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) told Szepessi. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had worked for short periods with a Podg@orze uncle of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) who ran a small metal factory in Rekawka.
Herr Szepessi eyed Pfefferberg from behind
spectacles. <div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Szepessi</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that's a
profession.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Szepessi</b></font>) took a pen, thoroughly
crossing out HIGH SCHOOL PROFESSOR, cancelling the Jagiellonian education of
which Pfefferberg was so proud, and over the top he (<font color='blue'><b>Szepessi</b></font>) wrote METAL POLISHER. He (<font color='blue'><b>Szepessi</b></font>)
reached for a rubber stamp and a pot of paste and took from his (<font color='blue'><b>Szepessi</b></font>) desk a blue sticker.
<div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Szepessi</b></font>) said, handing the document back to Pfefferberg--<div class="bookquote">``now should you meet a
Schupo, you can assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) that you're a useful member of society.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pfefferberg/Poldek Pfefferberg/Poldek</b></font>)</div>Later in the year they would send poor
Szepessi to Auschwitz for being so persuadable.

<p/>CHAPTER 14
From diverse sources--from the policeman
Toffel as well as drunken Bosch of
Ostfaser, the SS textile operation,
Oskar Schindler heard rumors that <div class="bookquote">``procedures in the ghetto''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>-LRB-whatever that meant-RRB- were
growing more intense. The SS were moving into Cracow some tough Sonderkommando
units from Lublin, where they had already done sterling work in matters of racial
purification. Toffel had suggested that unless Oskar wanted a break in production, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
ought to set up some camp beds for his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) night shift until after the first Sabbath in June.
So Oskar set up dormitories in the offices and upstairs in the munitions section. Some of
the night shift were happy to bed down there. Others had wives, children, parents waiting
back in the ghetto. Besides, they had the Blauschein, the holy blue sticker, on their
Kennkartes.
On June 3, Abraham Bankier,
Oskar's office manager, didn't turn up
at Lipowa Street. Schindler was still at home, drinking coffee in Straszewskiego Street,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) got a call from one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) secretaries. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'d seen Bankier marched out of the
ghetto, not even stopping at Optima, straight to the Prokocim depot. There'd been other
Emalia workers in the group too. There'd been Reich, Leser ... as many as a dozen.
Oskar called for his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) car to be brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) from the garage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) drove over the river and
down Lw@owska toward Prokocim. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) pass to the guards at the gate.
The depot yard itself was full of strings of cattle cars, the station crowded with the
ghetto's dispensable citizens standing in orderly lines, convinced still--and perhaps they
were right-- of the value of passive and orderly response. It was the first time Oskar had
seen this juxtaposition of humans and cattle cars, and it was a greater shock than hearing
of it; it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) pause on the edge of the platform. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) saw a jeweler he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) knew.
Seen Bankier? he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>)'s already in one of the cars, Herr Schindler,''  (<font color='red'><b>the jeweler</b></font>)</div>said the
jeweler. <div class="bookquote">``Where are they taking you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar asked the man. <div class="bookquote">``We're going to a labor
camp, they say. Near Lublin. Probably no worse than ...''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man waved a hand toward
distant Cracow.
Schindler took a pack of cigarettes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) pocket, found some 10-z@loty bills and
handed the pack and the notes to the jeweler, who thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>jeweler</b></font>). They had made them
leave home without anything this time. They said they'd be forwarding the baggage.
Late the previous year, Schindler had seen in the SS Bulletin of Budget and Construction
an invitation for bids for the construction of some crematoria in a camp southeast of
Lublin. Bel@zec. Schindler considered the jeweler. Sixty-three or comfour. A little thin;
had probably had pneumonia last winter. Worn pin-striped suit, too warm for the day.
And in the clear, knowing eyes a capacity to bear finite suffering. Even in the summer of
1942 it was impossible to guess at the connections between such a man as this and those
ovens of extraordinary cubic capacity. Did they intend to start epidemics among the
prisoners? Was that to be the method? Beginning from the engine, Schindler moved
along the line of more than twenty cattle cars, calling Bankier's name to the faces peering
down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bankier</b></font>) from the open grillwork high above the slats of the cars. It was fortunate for
Abraham that Oskar did not ask himself why it was Bankier's name he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) called, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) did
not pause and consider that Bankier's had only equal value to all the other names loaded
aboard the Ostbahn rolling stock. An existentialist might have been defeated by the
numbers at Prokocim, stunned by the equal appeal of all the names and voices.
But Schindler was a philosophic innocent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
knew the people he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) knew the name of
Bankier. <div class="bookquote">``Bankier! Bankier!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bankier</b></font>)
continued to call.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bankier</b></font>) was intercepted by a young SS
Oberscharf@uhrer, an expert railroad
shipper from Lublin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bankier</b></font>) asked for Schindler's pass. Oskar could see in the man's left
hand an enormous list--pages of names.
My workers, said Schindler. Essential industrial workers. My office manager. It's idiocy.
I have Armaments Inspectorate contracts, and here you are taking the workers I need to
fulfill them.
You can't have them back, said the young man. They're on the list. ... The SS NCO
knew from experience that the list conferred an equal destination on all its members.
Oskar dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) voice to that hard murmur, the growl of a reasonable man, well
connected, who wasn't going to bring up all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heavy guns yet. Did the Herr
Oberscharf@uhrer know how long it would take to train experts to replace those on the
list? At my works, Deutsche Email Fabrik, I have a munitions section under the special
protection of General Schindler, my namesake. Not only would the Oberscharf@uhrer's
comrades on the Russian Front be affected by the disruption of production, but the office
of the Armaments Inspectorate would demand explanations as well. The young man
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head--just a harassed transit official. <div class="bookquote">``I've heard that kind of story before, sir,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was worried. Oskar could tell it and kept leaning over him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) and speaking
softly with an edge of menace. <div class="bookquote">``It's not my place to argue with the list,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar.
<div class="bookquote">``Where is your superior officer?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The young man nodded toward an SS officer, a man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thirties wearing a frown above
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spectacles. <div class="bookquote">``May I have your name, Herr Untersturmf@uhrer?''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>),
already pulling a notebook from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) suit pocket. The officer also made a statement about
the holiness of the list. For this man it was the secure, rational, and sole basis for all this
milling of Jews and movement of rail cars. But Schindler got crisper now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d heard
about the list, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) said. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had asked was what the Untersturmf@uhrer's name was.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) intended to appeal directly to Oberf@uhrer Scherner and to General Schindler of the
Armaments Inspectorate.
<div class="bookquote">``Schindler?''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>asked the officer. For the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) took a careful look at Oskar. The man
was dressed like a tycoon, wore the right badge, had generals in the family. <div class="bookquote">``I believe I
can guarantee you, Herr Untersturmf@uhrer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Schindler in his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) benign grumble, <div class="bookquote">``that
you'll be in southern Russia within the week.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>The NCO going ahead, Herr Schindler and the officer marched side by side between the
ranks of prisoners and the loaded cattle cars. The locomotive was already steaming and
the engineer leaning from his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) cabin, looking down the length of the train, waiting to be
dispatched. The officer called to Ostbahn officials they passed on the platform to hold up.
At last they reached one of the rear cars. There were a dozen workers in there with
Bankier; they had all boarded together as if expecting a joint deliverance. The door was
unlocked and they jumped down--Bankier and Frankel from the office; Reich, Leser, and
the others from the factory. They were restrained, not wanting to permit anyone to detect
their pleasure at being saved the journey. Those left inside began chattering merrily, as if
they were fortunate to be traveling with so much extra room, while with emphasis in his (<font color='blue'><b>Reich</b></font>)
pen strokes, the officer removed the Emalia workers one at a time from the list and
required Oskar to initial the pages.
As Schindler thanked the officer and turned to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) workers away, the man detained
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the elbow of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suit coat. <div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it makes no difference to us, you
understand. We don't care whether it's this dozen or that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The officer, who had been frowning when Oskar first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), now seemed calm, as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had discovered the theorem behind the situation. You think your thirteen little
tinsmiths are important? We'll replace them with another thirteen little tinsmiths and all
your sentimentality for these will be defeated. <div class="bookquote">``It's the inconvenience to the list, that's
all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>the officer explained.
Plump little Bankier admitted that the group of them had neglected to pick up
Blauscheins from the old Polish Savings Bank. Schindler, suddenly testy, said to attend to
it. But what his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) curtness covered was dismay at those crowds at Prokocim who, for want
of a blue sticker, stood waiting for the new and decisive symbol of their status, the cattle
car, to be hauled by heavy engine across their range of vision. Now, the cattle cars told
them, we are all beasts together.

<p/>CHAPTER 15
From the faces of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) own workers, Oskar could read something of the ghetto's torment.
For a person had no time to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) breath there, no room to dig in, assert one's habits
or set up family rituals. Many took refuge and a sort of comfort in suspicion of
everyone--of the people in the same room as much as of the OD man in the street. But
then, even the sanest were not sure whom to trust. <div class="bookquote">``Each tenant,''  (<font color='red'><b>a artist</b></font>)</div>a young artist named
Josef Bau wrote of a ghetto house, <div class="bookquote">``has his (<font color='blue'><b>Herr</b></font>) own world of secrets and mysteries.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Josef/Josef Bau/Bau</b></font>)</div>Children suddenly stopped talking at a creaking in the stairwell. Adults woke from
dreams of exile and dispossession to find themselves exiled and dispossessed in a
crowded room in Podg@orze--the events of their dreams, the very taste of fear in
dreams, finding continuity in the fears of the day. Fierce rumors beset them in their room,
on the street, on the factory floor.
Spira had another list and it was either twice or three times as long as the last. All
children would go to Tarnow to be shot, to Stutthof to be drowned, to Breslau to be
indoctrinated, deracinated, operated upon. Do you have an elderly parent? They are
taking everyone over fifty to the Wieliczka salt mines. To work? No. To seal them up in
disused chambers.
All this hearsay, much of which reached Oskar, was based on a human instinct to prevent
the evil by voicing it--to forestall the Fates by showing them that you could be as
imaginative as they. But that June, all the worst of the dreams and whispers took concrete
form, and the most unimaginable rumor became a fact.
South of the ghetto, beyond Rekawka Street, rose a hilly parkland. There was an
intimacy, like that of medieval siege paintings, about the way you could look down over
the ghetto's southern wall. As you rode along the brow of the hills, the ghetto's map was
revealed, and you could see, as you passed them, what was happening in the streets
below. Schindler had noticed this advantage while riding here with Ingrid in the spring.
Now, shocked by the sights of the Prokocim depot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) decided to go riding again. The
morning after the rescue of Bankier, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bankier</b></font>) rented horses from the stables in Park
Bednarskiego. They were impeccably turned out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bankier</b></font>) and Ingrid, in long hacking jackets,
riding breeches, and dazzling boots. Two Sudeten blonds high above the disturbed ant
heap of the ghetto.
They rode up through the woods and had a short gallop over open meadows. From their
saddles they could now see Wegierska Street, crowds of people around the hospital
corner and, closer, a squad of SS working with dogs, entering houses, families pouring
forth into the street, pulling on coats in spite of the heat, anticipating a long absence.
Ingrid and Oskar reined in their horses in the shade of trees and considered this sight,
beginning to notice refinements of the scene. OD men armed with truncheons worked
with the SS. Some of these Jewish police seemed enthusiastic, for in a few minutes' view
from the hill Oskar saw three reluctant women beaten across the shoulders. At first there
was a naive anger in him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). The SS were using Jews to flog Jews. It would become clear
during the day, however, that some of the OD bludgeoned people to save them from
worse things. And there was a new rule for the OD anyhow: if you failed to deliver a
family into the street, your own family was forfeit.
Schindler noticed too that in Wegierska
Street two lines were continually forming. One was stable, but the other, as it lengthened,
was regularly marched away in segments around the corner into J@ozefi@nska and out
of sight. It was not hard to interpret this assembling and movement, since Schindler and
Ingrid, fringed by pine trees and elevated above the ghetto, were a distance of only two or
three short blocks from the Aktion. As families were routed out of the apartments, they
were separated forcibly into two lines without regard to family considerations.
Adolescent daughters with the proper papers went to the static line, from which they
called out to their middle-aged mothers in the other. A night-shift worker, still sullen
from disturbed sleep, was pointed to one line, his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) wife and child to the other. In the
middle of the street, the young man argued with an OD policeman. The man was saying,
Screw the Blauschein! I want to go with Eva and the kid.
An armed SS man intervened. Beside the nondescript mass of Ghettomenschen, such a
being, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) freshly pressed summer uniform, looked superbly fed and fresh. And from
the hill you could see the oil on the automatic pistol in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. The SS man hit the Jew
on the ear and was talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), loudly and harshly. Schindler, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) could not
hear, was sure it was a speech he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d encountered before, at Prokocim Station. It doesn't
make any difference to me. If you want to go with your frigging Jewish whore, go! The
man was led from one line to another. Schindler saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) edge along it to embrace his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
wife, and under cover of this act of conjugal loyalty, another woman crept back indoors
and was not seen by the SS Sonderkommando. Oskar and Ingrid turned their horses,
crossed a deserted avenue, and after a few meters, rode out onto a limestone platform
facing directly down Krakusa. In its closer reaches, this street was not as hectic as
Wegierska. A line of women and children, not so long, was being led away toward Piwna
Street. A guard walked in front, another strolled behind. There was an imbalance in the
line: far more children than the few women in it could themselves have borne. At the
rear, dawdling, was a toddler, boy or girl, dressed in a small scarlet coat and cap. The
reason it compelled Schindler's interest was that it made a statement, the way the
argumentative shift worker in Wegierska had. The statement had to do, of course, with a
passion for red.
Schindler consulted Ingrid. It was definitely a little girl, said Ingrid. Girls got obsessed by
a color, especially a color like that. As they watched, the Waffen SS man at the rear of
the column would occasionally put out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand and correct the drift of this scarlet node.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not do it harshly--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have been an elder brother. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) been asked by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
officers to do something to allay the sentimental concern of watching civilians, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
not have done better. So the moral anxiety of the two riders in Bednarskiego Park was,
for a second, irrationally allayed. But it was brief comfort. For behind the departing
column of women and children, to which the scarlet toddler placed a meandering period,
SS teams with dogs worked north along either side of the street.

<p/>They rampaged through the fetid apartments; as a symptom of their rush, a suitcase flew
from a second-story window and split open on the sidewalk. And, running before the
dogs, the men and women and children who had hidden in attics or closets, inside
drawerless dressers, the evaders of the first wave of search, jolted out onto the pavement,
yelling and gasping in terror of the Doberman pinschers. Everything seemed speeded-up,
difficult for the viewers on the hill to track. Those who had emerged were shot where
they stood on the sidewalk, flying out over the gutters at the impact of the bullets,
gushing blood into the drains. A mother and a boy, perhaps eight, perhaps a scrawny ten,
had retreated under a windowsill on the western side of Krakusa Street. Schindler felt an
intolerable fear for them, a terror in his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) own blood which loosened his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) thighs from the
saddle and threatened to unhorse him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) looked at Ingrid and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>) hands knotted on the reins. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>) exclaiming
and begging beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>).

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) eyes slewed up Krakusa to the scarlet child. They were doing it within half a block of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>); they hadn't waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>) column to turn out of sight into J@ozefi@nska. Schindler
could not have explained at first how that compounded the murders on the sidewalk. Yet
somehow it proved, in a way no one could ignore, their serious intent. While the scarlet
child stopped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>) column and turned to watch, they shot the woman in the neck, and
one of them, when the boy slid down the wall whimpering, jammed a boot down on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
head as if to hold it still and put the barrel against the back of the neck--the
recommended SS stance--and fired.
Oskar looked again for the small red girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had stopped and turned and seen the boot
descend. A gap had already widened between her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and the next to last in the column.
Again the SS guard corrected her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) drift fraternally, nudged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back into line. Herr
Schindler could not see why he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) did not bludgeon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) rifle butt, since at the other
end of Krakusa Street, mercy had been cancelled.
At last Schindler slipped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) horse, tripped, and found himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) knees hugging
the trunk of a pine tree. The urge to throw up his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) excellent breakfast was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) sensed, to be
suppressed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) suspected it meant that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) cunning body was doing was making
room to digest the horrors of Krakusa Street.
Their lack of shame, as men who had been born of women and had to write letters home
-LRB-what did they put in them?-RRB-, wasn't the worst aspect of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d seen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) knew they
had no shame, since the guard at the base of the column had not felt any need to stop the
red child from seeing things. But worst of all, if there was no shame, it meant there was
official sanction. No one could find refuge anymore behind the idea of German culture,
nor behind those pronouncements uttered by leaders to exempt anonymous men from
stepping beyond their gardens, from looking out their office windows at the realities on
the sidewalk. Oskar had seen in Krakusa Street a statement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) government's policy
which could not be written off as a temporary aberration. The SS men were, Oskar
believed, fulfilling there the orders of the leader, for otherwise their colleague at the rear
of the column would not have let a child watch. Later in the day, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had absorbed a
ration of brandy, Oskar understood the proposition in its clearest terms. They permitted
witnesses, such witnesses as the red toddler, because they believed the witnesses all
would perish too.
In the corner of Plac Zgody -LRB-peace
Square-RRB- stood an Apotheke run
by Tadeus Pankiewicz. It was a pharmacy in
the old style. Porcelain amphoras with the
Latin names of ancient remedies marked on them,
and a few hundred delicate and highly varnished
drawers, hid the complexity of the pharmacopoeia
from the citizens of Podg@orze. Magister
Pankiewicz lived above the shop by permission of the
authorities and at the request of the doctors in
the ghetto clinics. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pankiewicz</b></font>) was the only Pole
permitted to remain within the ghetto walls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pankiewicz</b></font>) was
a quiet man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pankiewicz</b></font>) early forties and had
intellectual interests. The Polish
impressionist Abraham Neumann, the composer Mordche Gebirtig, philosophical Leon
Steinberg, and the scientist and philosopher Dr. Rappaport were all regular visitors at
Pankiewicz'. The house was also a link, a mail drop for information and messages
running between the Jewish Combat Organization -LRB-Zob-RRB- and the partisans of the Polish
People's Army. Young Dolek Liebeskind and Shimon and Gusta Dranger, organizers of
the Cracow ZOB, would sometimes call there, but discreetly. It was important not to
implicate Tadeus Pankiewicz by their projects, which--unlike the cooperative policies of
the Judenrat-- involved furious and unequivocal resistance. The square in front of
Pankiewicz' pharmacy became in those first days of June a marshaling yard. <div class="bookquote">``It beggared
belief,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pankiewicz/Tadeus Pankiewicz</b></font>)</div>Pankiewicz would always thereafter say of Peace Square. In the parkland in the
middle, people were graded again and told to leave their baggage--No, no, it will be sent
on to you! Against the blank wall at the western end of the square, those who resisted or
were found carrying the secret option of Aryan papers in their pockets were shot without
any explanation or excuses to the people in the middle. The astounding thunder of the
rifles fractured conversation and hope. Yet in spite of the screams and wailing of those
related to the victims, some people--shocked or focusing desperately on life--seemed
almost unaware of the heap of corpses. Once the trucks rolled up, and details of Jewish
men loaded the dead into the back, those left in the square would begin at once to talk of
their futures again. And Pankiewicz would hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pankiewicz</b></font>) had been hearing all day from
SS NCO'S. <div class="bookquote">``I assure you, madam, you Jews are going to work. Do you think we can
afford to squander you?''  (<font color='red'><b>those women</b></font>)</div>Frantic desire to believe would show blatantly on the faces of
those women. And the SS rank and file, fresh from the executions against the wall,
strolled among the crowd and advised people on how to label their luggage.
From Bednarskiego, Oskar Schindler had not
been able to see into Plac Zgody. But
Pankiewicz in the square, like Schindler on the
hill, had never witnessed such dispassionate
horror. Like Oskar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was plagued by nausea,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) ears were full of an unreal sibilance, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had been struck on the head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was so
confused by the mass of noise and savagery, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
did not know that among the dead in the square were his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
friends Gebirtig, composer of that famed song
<div class="bookquote">``Burn City, Burn,''  (<font color='red'><b>composer</b></font>)</div>and gentle Neumann
the artist. Doctors began to stumble into the
pharmacy, panting, having run the two
blocks from the hospital. They wanted bandages
--they had dragged the wounded in from the streets. A doctor came in and asked for
emetics. For in the crowd a dozen people were gagging or comatose from swallowing
cyanide. An engineer Pankiewicz knew had slipped it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Pankiewicz</b></font>) mouth when his (<font color='blue'><b>Pankiewicz</b></font>) wife
wasn't looking.
Young Dr. Idek Schindel, working at the ghetto hospital on the corner of Wegierska,
heard from a woman who came in hysterical that they were taking the children. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d
seen the children lined up in Krakusa Street, Genia among them.
Schindel had left Genia that morning with neighbors--he (<font color='blue'><b>Pankiewicz</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) guardian in the ghetto;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) parents were still hiding in the countryside, intending to slip back into the ghetto,
which had been, until today, less perilous. This morning Genia, always her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) own woman,
had wandered away from the woman who was minding her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) back to the house where she (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>)
lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) uncle. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) had been arrested. It was in this way that Oskar Schindler,
from the park, had been drawn by her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) motherless presence in the column in Krakusa
Street.
Taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) surgical coat, Dr.
Schindel rushed to the square and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) almost at once, sitting on the grass, affecting
composure within the wall of guards. Dr. Schindel knew how faked the performance was,
having had to get up often enough to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) night terrors.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) moved around the periphery of the square and she (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>)
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>). Don't call out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) wanted
to say; I'll work it out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) didn't want
a scene because it could end badly for both of them. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) didn't need to be concerned,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) eyes grow mute and unknowing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) stopped, transfixed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>)
pitiably admirable cunning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) knew well enough at the age of three years not to take
the short-term comfort of calling out to uncles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) knew that there was no salvation in
engaging the interest of the SS in Uncle Idek. He (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) was composing a speech he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) intended to
make to the large Oberscharf@uhrer who stood by the execution wall. It was better not to
approach the authorities too humbly or through anyone of lesser rank. Looking back
again to the child, he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) saw the suspicion of a flutter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) eyes, and then, with a dazzling
speculator's coolness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) stepped between the two guards nearest to her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) and out of the
cordon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) moved with an aching slowness which, of course, galvanized her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) uncle's
vision, so that afterward he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would often see behind his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) closed eyes the image of her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>)
among the forest of gleaming SS knee boots. In Plac Zgody, no one saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>)
maintained her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) part-stumbling, part-ceremonial bluffer's pace all the way to Pankiewicz'
corner and around it, keeping to the blind side of the street. Dr. Schindel repressed the
urge he (<font color='blue'><b>Pankiewicz</b></font>) had to applaud. Though the performance deserved an audience, it would by its
nature be destroyed by one.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Pankiewicz</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Pankiewicz</b></font>) could not move directly behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) without disclosing her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) feat. Against all his (<font color='blue'><b>Pankiewicz</b></font>)
usual impulses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pankiewicz</b></font>) believed that the instinct which had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) infallibly out of Plac
Zgody would provide her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) with a hiding place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pankiewicz</b></font>) returned to the hospital by the
alternative route to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) time.
Genia returned to the front bedroom in Krakusa Street that she (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) shared with her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) uncle.
The street was deserted now, or, if a few were by cunning or false walls still there, they
did not declare themselves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) entered the house and hid under the bed. From the corner
of the street, Idek, returning to the house, saw the SS, in a last sweep, come knocking.
But Genia did not answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) would not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) arrived himself. It was just
that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) knew where to look, in the gap between curtain and window sash, and saw,
shining in the drabness of the room, her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) red shoe beneath the hem of the bedspread.
By this time, of course, Schindler had returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) horse to the stable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was not on the
hill to see the small but significant triumph of red Genia's return to the place where the
SS had first found her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was already in his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) office at DEF, shut away for a time, finding
the news too heavy to share with the day shift. Much later, in terms uncharacteristic of
jovial Herr Schindler, Cracow's favorite party guest, Zablocie's big spender, in terms,
that is, which showed--behind the playboy facade--an implacable judge, Oskar would
lay special weight on this day. <div class="bookquote">``Beyond this day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would claim, <div class="bookquote">``no thinking person
could fail to see what would happen. I was now resolved to do everything in my power to
defeat the system.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER 16
The SS kept at work in the ghetto until
Saturday evening. They operated with that efficiency which Oskar had observed in the
executions in Krakusa Street. Their thrusts were hard to predict, and people who had
escaped on Friday were caught on Saturday. Genia survived the week, however, through
her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) precocious gift for maintaining silence and for being imperceptible in scarlet.
Over in Zablocie, Schindler did not dare believe that this red child had survived the
Aktion process. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) knew from talking to Toffel and other acquaintances from police
headquarters in Pomorska Street that 7,000 people had been cleared from the ghetto. A
Gestapo official from the Jewish Affairs Office was delighted to confirm the clearance.
Up in Pomorska Street, among the paper pushers, the June Aktion was voted a triumph.
Oskar had now become more exact about this sort
of information. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) knew, for example, that the
Aktion had been under the overall management of
one Wilhelm Kunde but had been led by SS
Obersturmf@uhrer Otto von
Mallotke. Oskar kept no dossier, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
was preparing for another era when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would make a
full report to either Canaris or the world. It would
be made earlier than he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) expected. For the moment,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) inquired after matters which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had in the past
treated as temporary lunacies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
hard news from police contacts, but also from
clearheaded Jews like Stern. Intelligence from
other parts of Poland was piped into the ghetto, in part
through Pankiewicz' pharmacy, by the partisans of the
People's Army. Dolek Liebeskind, leader of the
Akiva Halutz Resistance Group, also
brought in information from other ghettos as a result of
his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) official traveling job with the Jewish
Communal Self-Help, an organization which the
Germans--with half an eye on the Red Cross
--permitted to exist.
It was no use bringing such tidings to the
Judenrat. The Judenrat Council did
not consider it civilly advisable to tell the
ghetto dwellers anything about the camps. People would
merely be distressed; there would be disorder in the
streets, and it would not go unpunished. It was always
better to let people hear wild rumors, decide
they were exaggerated, fall back on
hope. This had been the attitude of most
Jewish Councillors even under decent Artur Rosenzweig. But Rosenzweig was gone. The
salesman David Gutter, helped by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gutter</b></font>) Germanic name, would soon become president of
the Judenrat. Food rations were now diverted not only by certain SS officials but by
Gutter and the new Councillors, whose vicar in the streets was high-booted Symche
Spira. The Judenrat therefore had no interest anymore in informing the ghetto people
about their probable destinations, since they were confident that they themselves would
not be made to travel.
The beginning of knowledge for the ghetto, and the clinching news for Oskar, was the
return to Cracow--eight days after he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d been shipped off from Prokocim--of the young
pharmacist Bachner. No one knew how he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had got back inside the ghetto, or the mystery
of why he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) returned to a place from which the SS would simply send him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) off on another
journey. But it was, of course, the pull of the known that brought Bachner home.
All the way down Lw@owska and into the streets behind Plac Zgody he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) story.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had seen the final horror, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was mad-eyed, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) brief absence his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
hair had silvered. All the Cracow people who had
been rounded up in early June had been taken
nearly to Russia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said, to the camp of
Bel@zec. When the trains arrived at the
railway station, the people were driven out by Ukrainians with clubs. There was a
frightful stench about the place, but an SS man had kindly told people that that was due to
the use of disinfectant. The people were lined up in front of two large warehouses, one
marked <div class="bookquote">``CLOAK ROOM''  (<font color='red'><b>The people</b></font>)</div>and the other <div class="bookquote">``VALUABLES.''  (<font color='red'><b>The people</b></font>)</div>The new arrivals were made
to undress, and a small Jewish boy passed among the crowd handing out lengths of string
with which to tie their shoes together. Spectacles and rings were removed. So, naked, the
prisoners had their heads shaved in the hairdresser's, an SS NCO telling them that their
hair was needed to make something special for U-boat crews. It would grow again, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
said, maintaining the myth of their continued usefulness. At last the victims were driven
down a barbed-wire passage to bunkers which had copper Stars of David on their roofs
and were labeled BATHS AND INHALATION ROOMS. SS men reassured them all the
way, telling them to breathe deeply, that it was an excellent means of disinfection.
Bachner saw a little girl drop a bracelet on the ground, and a boy of three picked it up and
went into the bunker playing with it. In the bunkers, said Bachner, they were all gassed.
And afterward, squads were sent in to disentangle the pyramid of corpses and take the
bodies away for burial. It had taken barely two days, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, before they were all dead,
except for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). While waiting in an enclosure for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turn, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d somehow got to a latrine
and lowered himself into the pit. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d stayed there three days, the human waste up to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
neck. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, had been a hive of flies.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d slept standing, wedged in the hole for fear of drowning there. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d crawled
out at night.
Somehow he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d walked out of Bel@zec, following the railway tracks. Everyone
understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had got out precisely because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was beyond reason. Likewise, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d
been cleaned by someone's hand--a peasant woman's, perhaps--and put into fresh
clothes for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) journey back to the starting point.
Even then there were people in Cracow who thought Bachner's story a dangerous rumor.
Postcards had come to relatives from prisoners in Auschwitz. So if it was true of
Bel@zec, it couldn't be true of Auschwitz. And was it credible? On the short emotional
rations of the ghetto, one got by through sticking to the credible. The chambers of
Bel@zec, Schindler found out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) sources, had been completed by March of that
year under the supervision of a Hamburg engineering firm and of SS engineers from
Oranienburg. From Bachner's testimony, it seemed that 3,000 killings a day were not
beyond their capacity.
Crematoria were under construction, lest
old-fashioned means of disposal of corpses
put a brake on the new killing method. The
same company involved in Bel@zec had installed
identical facilities at Sobibor, also in
the Lublin district. Bids had been accepted,
and construction was well advanced, for a similar
installation at Treblinka, near Warsaw. And
chambers and ovens were both in operation at the
Auschwitz main camp and at the vast
Auschwitz II camp a few kilometers
away at Birkenau. The resistance claimed that 10,000 murders on a given day were
within the capacity of Auschwitz II. Then, for the @l@od@z area, there was the camp at
Chelmno, also equipped according to the new technology. To write these things now is
to state the commonplaces of history. But to find them out in 1942, to have them break
upon you from a June sky, was to suffer a fundamental shock, a derangement in that area
of the brain in which stable ideas about humankind and its possibilities are kept.
Throughout Europe that summer some millions of people, Oskar among them, and the
ghetto dwellers of Cracow too, tortuously adjusted the economies of their souls to the
idea of Bel@zec or of like enclosures in the Polish forests. That summer also Schindler
wound up the bankrupt estate of Rekord and, under the provisions of the Polish
Commercial Court, acquired by a species of pro forma auction ownership of the property.
Though the German armies were over the Don and on their way to the Caucasus oil
fields, Oskar discerned by the evidence of what had happened in Krakusa Street that they
could not finally succeed. Therefore it was a good season to legitimize to the limit his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
possession of the factory in Lipowa Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) still hoped, in a way that was almost
childlike and to which history would pay no regard, that the fall of the evil king would
not bear away that legitimacy--that in the new era he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would go on being Hans
Schindler's successful boy from Zwittau. Jereth of the box factory went on pressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
about building a hut--a refuge--on his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) patch of wasteland. Oskar got the necessary
approvals from the bureaucrats. A rest area for the night shift was his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) story. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had the
lumber for it--it had been donated by Jereth himself. When finished in the autumn, it
seemed a slight and comfortless structure. The planking had that crate-wood greenness
and looked as if it would shrink as it got darker, and let in the slanting snow. But during
an Aktion in October it was a haven for Mr. and Mrs. Jereth, for the workers from the
box factory and the radiator works, and for Oskar's night shift.
The Oskar Schindler who comes down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) office on the frosty mornings of an
Aktion to speak to the SS man, to the Ukrainian auxiliary, to the Blue Police, and to OD
details who would have marched across from Podg@orze to escort his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) night shift home;
the Oskar Schindler who, drinking coffee, calls Wachtmeister Bosko's office near the
ghetto and tells some lie about why his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) night shift must stay in Lipowa Street this
morning--that Oskar Schindler has endangered himself now beyond the limit of cautious
business practice. The men of influence who have twice sprung him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) from prison cannot
do it indefinitely even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) is generous to them on their birthdays. This year they are
putting men of influence in Auschwitz. If they die there, their widows get a terse and
unregretful telegram from the Commandant. <div class="bookquote">``YOUR HUSBAND HAS DIED IN
KONZENTRATIONSLAGER AUSCHWITZ.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bosko/Wachtmeister/Wachtmeister Oswald Bosko</b></font>)</div>Bosko himself was lanky, thinner than Oskar.
Gruff-voiced, and like him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) a German Czech.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) family, like Oskar's, was conservative and
looked to the old Germanic values. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had,
for a brief season, felt a pan-Germanic
anticipation at the rise of Hitler, exactly
the way Beethoven had felt a grand European fervor for Napoleon. In Vienna, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>)
had been studying theology, he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>)'d joined the SS-- partly as an alternative to conscription
into the Wehrmacht, partly from an evanescent ardor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) regretted that ardor now and
was, more fully than Oskar knew, expiating it. All that Oskar understood about him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) at the
time was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was always pleased to undermine an Aktion. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) responsibility was the
perimeter of the ghetto, and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) office beyond the walls he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) looked inward at the
Aktion with a precise horror, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), like Oskar, considered himself a potential witness.
Oskar did not know that in the October Aktion, Bosko had smuggled some dozens of
children out of the ghetto in cardboard boxes. Oskar did not know either that the
Wachtmeister provided, ten at a time, general passes for the underground. The Jewish
Combat Organization -LRB-Zob-RRB- was strong in Cracow. It was made up mainly of youth-club
members, especially of members of Akiva--a club named after the legendary Rabbi
Akiva ben Joseph, scholar of the Mishna. The ZOB was led by a married couple, Shimon
and Gusta Dranger--her (<font color='blue'><b>dozens</b></font>) diary would become a classic of the Resistance--and by Dolek
Liebeskind. Its members needed to pass freely into and out of the ghetto, for purposes of
recruitment and to carry currency, forged documents, and copies of the underground
newspaper. They had contacts with the left-wing Polish People's Army, which was based
in the forests around Cracow, and which also needed the documents Bosko provided.
Bosko's contacts with ZOB and the People's Army were therefore sufficient to hang him (<font color='blue'><b>Shimon</b></font>);
but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Shimon</b></font>) secretly mocked and despised himself and had contempt for partial rescues.
For Bosko wanted to save everyone, and would soon try to, and would perish because of
it. Danka Dresner, cousin of red Genia, was fourteen years old and had by then outgrown
the sure infantile instincts which had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) small relative safely out of the cordon in
Plac Zgody. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Genia</b></font>) had work as a cleaning woman at the Luftwaffe base, the truth
was that by autumn any woman under fifteen or more than forty could be taken away to
the camps anyhow. Therefore, on the morning an SS Sonderkommando and squads of
Security Police rolled into Lw@owska Street, Mrs. Dresner took Danka with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) down to
Dabrowski, to the house of a neighbor who had a false wall. The neighbor was a woman
in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) late thirties, a servant at the Gestapo mess near the Wawel, who could therefore
expect some preferential treatment. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had elderly parents who were automatic risks.
So she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had bricked up a 60-centimeter cavity for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) parents, a costly project, since bricks
had to be smuggled into the ghetto in barrows under heaps of legal goods--rags,
firewood, disinfectant.
God knew what her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bricked-up secret
space had cost her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--maybe 5,000 z@l.,
maybe 10,000.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d mentioned it a number of times to Mrs.
Dresner. If there was an Aktion, Mrs.
Dresner could bring Danka and come herself. Therefore,
on the morning Danka and Mrs. Dresner heard
from around the corner of Dabrowski the startling
noise, the bark of Dalmatians and
Dobermans, the megaphoned roaring of
Oberscharf@uhrers, they hurried to their friend's place.
When the Dresners had gone up the stairs and found the right room, they could see that
the clamor had had an effect on their friend. <div class="bookquote">``It sounds bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman. <div class="bookquote">``I have my
parents in there already. I can fit the girl in. But not you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Danka/Danka Dresner</b></font>)</div>Danka stared, captivated, at the end wall, at its stained wallpaper. In there, sandwiched in
brick, rats perhaps worrying at their feet, their senses stretched by darkness, were this
woman's elderly mother and father.
Mrs. Dresner could tell that the woman wasn't rational. The girl, but not you, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) kept
saying. It was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) thought that should the SS penetrate the wall they would be more
forgiving on account of Danka's lesser poundage. Mrs.
Dresner explained that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) was scarcely obese,
that the Aktion seemed to be concentrating on this
side of Lw@owska Street, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) had
nowhere else to go. And that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) could fit. Danka was
a reliable girl, said Mrs. Dresner, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>)
would feel safer with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) mother in there. You could see
by measuring the wall with your eyes that four people could
fit abreast in the cavity. But shots from two
blocks distant swept away the last of the
woman's reason. <div class="bookquote">``I can fit the girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
screamed. <div class="bookquote">``I want you to go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dresner/Dresner</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Dresner turned to Danka and told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) to go into the wall. Later Danka would not know why she (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) had obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) mother and
gone so mutely into hiding. The woman took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to the attic, removed a rug from the
floor, then lifted a raft of floorboards. Then Danka descended into the cavity. It wasn't
black in there; the parents were burning a stub of candle. Danka found herself beside the
woman--someone else's mother but, beyond the unwashed smell, with the same warm,
protective musk of motherhood. The woman smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) briefly. The husband stood on
the far side of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes closed, not to be distracted from signals from
outside.
After a time the friend's mother motioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could sit if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wanted. So
Danka crouched sideways and found a comfortable posture on the floor of the cavity. No
rats troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heard no sound--not a word from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother and the friend beyond
the wall. Above everything else she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt unexpectedly safe. Andwiththe sensation of
safety came displeasure at herself for obeying her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's order so woodenly, and then
fear for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother, who was out there in the world of Aktions.
Mrs. Dresner did not leave the house at once. The SS were in Dabrowski Street now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>)
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) might as well stay on. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) was taken, it was no loss to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) friend. It might,
in fact, be a positive help. If they took a woman from this room, it would probably
increase their satisfaction with their task, exempt them from a sharper inspection of the
state of the wallpaper.
But the woman had convinced herself no one would survive the search if Mrs. Dresner
stayed in the room; and, Mrs. Dresner could see, no one would if the woman remained in
that state. Therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood up, calmly despairing of herself, and left. They would find
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on the steps or in the hall. Why not on the street? she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wondered. It was so much an
unwritten rule that ghetto natives must stay on quivering in their rooms until discovered
that anyone found moving on the stairways was somehow guilty of defiance of the
system.
A figure in a cap prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from going out. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appeared on the front step, squinting
down the dark corridor to the cold blue light of the courtyard beyond. Staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
recognized her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). It was an acquaintance of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) elder son's; but you could
not be sure that that counted for anything; you could not know what pressures they'd put
on the OD boys. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) stepped into the hall and approached her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Pani Dresner,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
pointed at the stairwell. <div class="bookquote">``They'll be gone in ten minutes. You stay under the stairs. Go
on. Get under the stairs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>As numbly as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daughter had obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now obeyed the OD youth. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) crouched
down under the stairs, but knew it was no good. The autumn light from the courtyard
revealed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). If they wanted to look at the courtyard, or at the apartment door at the rear
of the hallway, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would be seen. Since upright or cowering made no difference, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
stood upright. From near the front door, the OD man urged her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to stay there. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
went. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard yells, orders, and appeals, and it all seemed to be as close as next door.
At last, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was back with others. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard the boots at the front door. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) say
in German that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d searched the ground floor and no one was at home. There were
occupied rooms upstairs, though. It was such a prosaic conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had with the SS
men that it didn't seem to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to do justice to the risk he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was taking. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was staking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
existence against the likelihood that having worked down Lw@owska and so far down
Dabrowski they might by now be incompetent enough not to search the ground floor
themselves and therefore not to find Mrs. Dresner, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dimly knew, beneath the
stairs.
In the end they took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) word. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) heard them on the stairs, opening and slamming doors
on the first landing, their boots clattering on the floor in the room of the cavity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) heard
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) friend's raised, shrewish voice ... of course I have a work permit, I work over at the
Gestapo mess, I know all the gentlemen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) heard them come down from the second
floor with someone; with more than one; a couple, a family. Substitutes for me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>)
would later think. A middle-aged male voice with an edge of bronchitis to it said, <div class="bookquote">``But
surely, gentlemen, we can take some clothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>a railway porter</b></font>)</div>And in a tone as indifferent as that of a
railway porter asked for timetable information, the SS man telling him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in Polish, <div class="bookquote">``There's
no need for it. At these places they provide everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The sound receded. Mrs. Dresner waited. There was no second sweep. The second sweep
would be tomorrow or the day after. They would return again and again now, culling the
ghetto. What in June had been seen as a culminating horror had become by October a
daily process. And as grateful as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) was to the OD boy, it was clear as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) went upstairs
to get Danka that when murder is as scheduled, habitual, industrial as it was here in
Cracow you could scarcely, with tentative heroism, redirect the overriding energy of the
system. The more Orthodox of the ghetto had a slogan--<div class="bookquote">``An hour of life is still life.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Orthodox</b></font>)</div>The
OD boy had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) that hour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) knew there was no one who could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) more.
Upstairs, the woman was a little shamefaced.
<div class="bookquote">``The girl can come whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wishes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) said. That is, I didn't exclude you out of
cowardice, but as a matter of policy. And the policy stands. You can't be accepted, but
the girl can.
Mrs. Dresner did not argue--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) had a sense that the woman's stance was part of the
same equation that had saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) in the downstairs hall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) thanked the woman. Danka
might need to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) hospitality again.
From now on, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) looked young for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) forty-two years and still had her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) health,
Mrs.
Dresner would attempt to survive on that basis
--the economic one, the putative value of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) strength to the Armaments Inspectorate or
to some other wing of the war effort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) wasn't confident of the idea. These days anyone
with half a grasp on truth could tell that the SS believed the death of the socially
unappeasable Jew outbalanced any value he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) might have as an item of labor. And the
question is, in such an era, Who saves Juda Dresner, factory purchasing officer? Who
saves Janek Dresner, auto
mechanic at the Wehrmacht garage? Who saves Danka Dresner, Luftwaffe cleaning
woman, on the morning the SS finally choose to ignore their economic value?
While the OD man was arranging Mrs.
Dresner's survival in the hallway of the house in Dabrowski, the young Zionists of the
Halutz Youth and the ZOB were preparing a more visible act of resistance. They had
acquired uniforms of the Waffen SS and, with them, the entitlement to visit the SS'-
RESERVED Cyganeria Restaurant in @sw Ducha Plac, across the square from the
S@lowacki Theater. In the Cyganeria they left a bomb which blew the tables through the
roof, tore seven SS men to fragments, and injured some forty more.
When Oskar heard about it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could have been there, buttering up some official.
It was the deliberate intent of Shimon and
Gusta Dranger and their colleagues to run against
the ancient pacifism of the ghetto, to convert it
to universal rebellion. They bombed the
SS'-ONLY Bagatella Cinema in
Karmelicka Street. In the dark, Leni
Riefenstahl flickered the promise of German womanhood to the wandering soldier frayed
from performing the nation's works in the barbarous ghetto or on the increasingly risky
streets of Polish Cracow, and the next second a vast yellow spear of flame extinguished
the sight.
The ZOB would in a few months sink patrol
boats on the Vistula, fire-bomb sundry
military garages throughout the city, arrange
Passierscheins for people who were not supposed to have
them, smuggle passport photographs out
to centers where they could be used in the forging of Aryan
papers, derail the elegant Army-only train
that ran between Cracow and Bochnia, and get their
underground newspaper into circulation. They would also
arrange for two of OD Chief Spira's
lieutenants, Spitz and Forster, who
had drawn up lists for the imprisonment of thousands, to walk into a Gestapo ambush. It
was a variation of an old undergraduate trick. One of the underground, posing as an
informer, made an appointment to meet the two policemen in a village near Cracow. At
the same time, a separate supposed informer told the Gestapo that two leaders of the
Jewish partisan movement could be found at a particular rendezvous point. Spitz and
Forster were both mown down while running from the Gestapo.
Still, the style of resistance for the ghetto dwellers remained that of Artur Rosenzweig,
who, when asked in June to make a list of thousands for deportation, had placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosenzweig</b></font>) own
name, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosenzweig</b></font>) wife's, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosenzweig</b></font>) daughter's at the top.
Over in Zablocie, in the backyard of Emalia, Mr. Jereth and Oskar Schindler were
pursuing their own species of resistance by planning a second barracks.

<p/>CHAPTER 17
An Austrian dentist named Sedlacek had now arrived in Cracow and was making wary
enquiries about Schindler. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had come by train from Budapest and carried a list of
possible Cracow contacts and, in a false-bottomed suitcase, a quantity of Occupation
z@loty, which, since Governor General Frank had abolished the major denominations of
Polish money, took up an unconscionable space.
Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) pretended to be traveling on business, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was a courier for a Zionist rescue
organization in Budapest.
Even in the autumn of 1942, the Zionists of Palestine, let alone the population of the
world, knew nothing but rumors of what was happening in Europe. They had set up a
bureau in Istanbul to gather hard information. From an apartment in the Beyoglu section
of the city, three agents sent out postcards addressed to every Zionist body in German
Europe. The postcards read:
<div class="bookquote">``Please let me know how you are. Eretz is longing for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Eretz meant the <div class="bookquote">``land''  (<font color='red'><b>any Zionist Israel</b></font>)</div>and,
to any Zionist, Israel. Each of the postcards was signed by one of the three, a girl named
Sarka Mandelblatt, who had a convenient Turkish citizenship.
The postcards had gone into the void. No one answered. It meant that the addressees were
in prison, or in the forest, or at labor in some camp, or in a ghetto, or dead. All the
Zionists of Istanbul had was the ominous negative evidence of silence.
In the late autumn of 1942, they at last received one reply, a postcard with a view of the
Belvaros of Budapest. The message on it read: <div class="bookquote">``Encouraged by your interest in my
situation.
Rahamim maher -LSB-urgent help-RSB- is much
needed. Please keep in touch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a Budapest jeweler</b></font>)</div>This reply had been composed by a Budapest jeweler named Samu Springmann, who'd
first received and then puzzled out the message on Sarka Mandelblatt's postcard. Samu
was a slight man, jockey size, in the prime of his (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) thirties. Since the age of thirteen,
despite an inalienable probity, he (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) had been oiling officials, doing favors for the
diplomatic corps, bribing the heavy-handed Hungarian Secret Police. Now the Istanbul
people let him (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) know that they wanted to use him (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) to pipe rescue money into the German
empire and to transmit through them to the world some definite intelligence on what was
happening to European Jewry.
In the German-allied Hungary of General Horthy, Samu Springmann and his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) Zionist
colleagues were as bereft of solid news from beyond the Polish border as the people in
Istanbul. But he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) began to recruit couriers who, for a percentage of the bag or else out of
conviction, would be willing to penetrate the German territories. One of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) couriers was
a diamond dealer, Erich Popescu, an agent of the Hungarian Secret Police. Another was
an underworld carpet smuggler, Bandi Grosz, who had also assisted the secret police, but
who began to work for Springmann to expiate all the grief he (<font color='blue'><b>smuggler</b></font>) had caused his (<font color='blue'><b>smuggler</b></font>) late mother.
A third was Rudi Schulz, an Austrian safecracker, an agent for the Gestapo Management
Bureau in Stuttgart. Springmann had a gift for playing with double agents such as
Popescu, Grosz, and Schulz, by touching their sentimentality, their greed, and, if any,
their principles.
Some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schulz</b></font>) couriers were idealists, working from firm premises. Sedlacek, who asked
after Herr Schindler in Cracow near the end of 1942, belonged to that species. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) had a
successful dental practice in Vienna and, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) mid-forties, did not need to lug falsebottomed
suitcases into Poland. But here he (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) was, with a list in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) pocket, the list having
come from Istanbul. And the second name on the list, Oskar's!
It meant that someone--Itzhak Stern, the
businessman Ginter, Dr. Alexander Biberstein
--had forwarded Schindler's name to the Zionists in Palestine. Without knowing it, Herr
Schindler had been nominated for the post of righteous person.
Dr. Sedlacek had a friend in the Cracow
garrison, a fellow Viennese, a patient
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>)'d got to know in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) practice. It was Major Franz Von Korab of the Wehrmacht. On
his (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) first evening in Cracow, the dentist met Major Von Korab at the Hotel Cracovia for a
drink. Sedlacek had had a miserable day; had gone to the gray Vistula and looked across
at Podg@orze, the cold fortress of barbed wire and lofty gravestoned walls, a cloud of a
special dimness above it this mean winter's day, a sharper rain falling there beyond the
fake eastern gate where even the policemen looked accursed. When it was time to go and
meet Von Korab, he (<font color='blue'><b>Korab</b></font>) went gratefully.
In the suburbs of Vienna it had always been rumored that Von Korab had a Jewish
grandmother. Patients would idly say so--in the Reich, genealogical gossip was as
acceptable small talk as was the weather. People would seriously speculate over drinks
whether it was true that Reinhard Heydrich's grandmother had married a Jew named
Suss. Once, against all good sense but for the sake of friendship, Von Korab had
confessed to Sedlacek that the rumor was true in his (<font color='blue'><b>Korab</b></font>) case. This confession had been a
gesture of trust, which it would now be safe to return. Sedlacek therefore asked the major
about some of the people on the Istanbul list. To Schindler's name, Von Korab responded
with an indulgent laugh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Korab</b></font>) knew Herr Schindler, had dined with him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was physically
impressive, said the major, and made money hand over fist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was much brighter than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) pretended to be. I can call him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) right now and make an appointment, said Von Korab.
At ten the next morning they entered the Emalia office. Schindler accepted Sedlacek
politely but watched Major Von Korab, measuring .his (<font color='blue'><b>Korab</b></font>) trust of the dentist. After a time
Oskar warmed to the stranger, and the major excused himself and would not stay for
morning coffee. <div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sedlacek/Dr. Sedlacek</b></font>)</div>said Sedlacek, when Von Korab was gone, <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you
exactly where I come from.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Von Korab</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Korab</b></font>) did not mention the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Korab</b></font>) had brought, nor the likelihood that in the future trusted
contacts in Poland would be handed small fortunes in Jewish Joint Distribution
Committee cash. What the dentist wanted to know, without any financial coloring, was
what Herr Schindler knew and thought about the war against Jewry in Poland. Once
Sedlacek had the question out, Schindler hesitated. In that second, Sedlacek expected a
refusal. Schindler's expanding workshop employed 550 Jews at the SS rental rate. The
Armaments Inspectorate guaranteed a man like Schindler a continuity of rich contracts;
the SS promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>), for no more than 7.50 Reichsmarks a day per person, a continuity
of slaves. It should not be a surprise if he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) sat back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) padded leather chair and claimed
ignorance.
<div class="bookquote">``There is one problem, Herr Sedlacek,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) growled. <div class="bookquote">``It's this. What they are doing to
people in this country is beyond belief.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sedlacek/Dr. Sedlacek</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Sedlacek, <div class="bookquote">``that you're concerned my principals won't believe
you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sedlacek/Dr. Sedlacek</b></font>)</div>Schindler said, <div class="bookquote">``Since I scarcely believe
it myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) rose, went to the liquor
cabinet, poured two snifters of cognac and brought one for Dr. Sedlacek. Returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>)
own side of the desk with the other, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) took a swallow, frowned at an invoice, picked it
up, went to the door on the balls of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) feet and swung it open as if to trap an
eavesdropper. For a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) stood there framed. Then Sedlacek heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) talking
calmly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) Polish secretary about the invoice. In a few minutes, closing the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>)
returned to Sedlacek, took a seat behind the desk, and after another deep swallow, began
to talk.
Even among Sedlacek's own small cell,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) Viennese anti-Nazi club, it was not
imagined that the pursuit of the Jews had grown quite
so systematic. Not only was the story
Schindler told him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) startling simply in moral
terms: one was asked to believe that in the midst of a
desperate battle, the National Socialists
would devote thousands of men, the resources of
precious railroads, an enormous cubic
footage of cargo space, expensive
techniques of engineering, a fatal margin of their
research-and-development scientists, a
substantial bureaucracy, whole arsenals of
automatic weapons, whole magazines of
ammunition, all to an extermination which had no
military or economic meaning but merely a
psychological one. Dr. Sedlacek had
expected mere horror stories--hunger,
economic strictures, violent pogroms in this city or that, violations of ownership--all the
historically accustomed things.
Oskar's summary of events in Poland convinced
Sedlacek precisely because of the sort of man
Oskar was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) had done well from the
Occupation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) sat at the heart of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) own hive,
a brandy snifter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) hand. There were both an
impressive surface calm and a fundamental
anger in him (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) was like a man who had, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>)
regret, found it impossible to disbelieve the
worst. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) showed no tendency to be
extravagant in the facts he (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) relayed.
If I can arrange your visa, said
Sedlacek, would you come to Budapest and pass on what you just told me to my
principals and the others? Schindler seemed momentarily surprised. You can write a
report, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) said. And surely you've heard this sort of thing from other sources. But
Sedlacek told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) no; there had been individual stories, details of this incident and that.
No comprehensive picture. Come to Budapest, said Sedlacek. Mind you, it might be
uncomfortable traveling.
Do you mean, asked Schindler, that I have to cross the border on foot?
Not as bad as that, said the dentist. You might have to travel in a freight train.
I'll come, said Oskar Schindler.
Dr. Sedlacek asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) about the other names
on the Istanbul list. At the top of the list, for
instance, stood a Cracow dentist. Dentists were
always easy to visit, said Sedlacek, since
everyone on earth has at least one bona fide
cavity. No, said Herr Schindler. Don't
visit this man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'s been compromised
by the SS.
Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) left Cracow to return to Mr.
Springmann in Budapest, Dr. Sedlacek
arranged another meeting with Schindler. In Oskar's office at DEF, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) handed over
nearly all the currency Springmann had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) to bring to Poland. There was always
some risk, in view of Schindler's hedonistic taste, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) would spend it on black-market
jewelry. But neither Springmann nor Istanbul required any assurances. They could never
hope to play the auditor.
It must be stated that Oskar behaved impeccably and gave the cash to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) contacts in the
Jewish community to spend according to their judgment. Mordecai Wulkan, who like
Mrs.
Dresner would in time come to know Herr Oskar Schindler, was a jeweler by trade. Now,
late in the year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was visited at home by one of Spira's political OD. This wasn't
trouble, the OD man said. Certainly Wulkan had a record. A year before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) had been
picked up by the OD for selling currency on the black market. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) had refused to
work as an agent for the Currency Control Bureau, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) had been beaten up by the SS, and
Mrs. Wulkan had had to visit Wachtmeister Beck in the ghetto police office and pay a
bribe for his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) release.
This June he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>)'d been seized for transport to Bel@zec, but an OD man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d known had
arrived to pick him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up and led him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) straight out of the Optima yard. For there were
Zionists in the OD, however small their chances of ever beholding Jerusalem might be.
The OD man who visited him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) this time was no
Zionist. The SS, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told Wulkan,
urgently needed four jewelers. Symche
Spira had been given three hours to find them. In this way Herzog, Friedner, Gr@uner,
and Wulkan, four jewelers, were assembled at the OD station and marched out of the
ghetto to the old Technical Academy, now a warehouse for the SS Economic and
Administrative Main Office.
It was obvious to Wulkan as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) entered the Academy that a great security operated here.
At every door stood a guard. In the front hall, an SS officer told the four jewelers that
should they speak to anyone about their work here, they could expect to be sent to a labor
camp. They were to bring with them, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) said, every day, their diamond-grading kits, their
equipment for assessing the karat value of gold.
They were led down into the basement. Around the walls stood racks laden with suitcases
and towering layers of briefcases, each with a name studiously and futilely printed on it
by its past owner. Beneath the high windows stood a line of wooden crates. As the four
jewelers squatted in the center of the floor, two SS men took down a suitcase, labored
across the cellar with it, and emptied it in front of Herzog. They returned to the rack for
another, which they emptied in front of Gr@uner. Then they brought a cascade of gold
for Friedner, then for Wulkan. It was old gold--rings, brooches, bracelets, watches,
lorgnettes, cigarette holders.
The jewelers were to grade the gold, separate the gold plate from the solid. Diamonds and
pearls were to be valued. They were to classify everything, according to value and karat
weight, in separate heaps.
At first they picked up individual pieces
tentatively, but then worked faster as old
professional habits asserted themselves. As the
gold and jewelry went into their piles, the SS
men loaded the stuff into its appropriate
crate. Every time a crate was filled, it was
labeled in black paint--SS
REICHSF@UHRER BERLIN. The SS
Reichsf@uhrer was Himmler himself, in whose name the confiscated jewelry of Europe
was deposited in the Reichsbank. There were quantities of children's rings, and one had
to keep a cool rational control of one's knowledge of their provenance. Only once did the
jewelers falter: when the SS men opened a suitcase and out of it tumbled gold teeth still
smeared with blood. There in a pile at Wulkan's knees, the mouths of a thousand dead
were represented, each one calling for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) to join them by standing and flinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>)
grading stone across the room and declaring the tainted origin of all this precious stuff.
Then, after the hiatus, Herzog and Gr@uner, Wulkan and Friedner commenced to grade
again, aware now, of course, of the radiant value of whatever gold they themselves
carried in their mouths, fearful that the SS would come prospecting for it.
It took six weeks for them to work through the
treasures of the Technical Academy. After they
had finished there, they were taken to a disused garage which
had been converted to a silver warehouse. The
lubrication pits were filled to spilling over with
solid silver--rings, pendants, Passover
platters, yad pointers, breastplates,
crowns, candelabra. They separated the solid silver from the silver plate; they weighed it
all. The SS officer in charge complained that some of these objects were awkward to
pack, and Mordecai Wulkan suggested that perhaps they might consider melting them
down. It seemed to Wulkan, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) was not pious, that it would be somehow better, a
minor triumph, if the Reich inherited silver from which the Judaic form had been
removed. But for some reason the SS officer refused. Perhaps the objects were intended
for some didactic museum inside the Reich. Or perhaps the SS liked the artistry of
synagogue silverware.
When this appraisal work ran out, Wulkan was again at a loss for employment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>)
needed to leave the ghetto regularly to find enough food for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) family, especially for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>)
bronchitic daughter. For a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) worked at a metal factory in Kazimierz, getting to
know an SS moderate, Oberscharf@uhrer Gola. Gola found him (<font color='blue'><b>Gola</b></font>) work as a maintenance
man at the SA barracks near Wawel. As Wulkan entered the mess with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) wrenches, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>)
saw above the door the inscription, F@UR JUDEN UND HUNDE EINTRITT
VERBOTEN: Entrance forbidden to Jews and dogs. This sign, together with the hundred
thousand teeth he (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) had appraised at the Technical Academy, convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) that
deliverance could not in the end be expected from the offhand favor of Oberscharf@uhrer
Gola. Gola drank here without noticing the sign; and neither would he (<font color='blue'><b>Gola</b></font>) notice the absence
of the Wulkan family on the day they were taken to Bel@zec or some place of equal
efficiency. Therefore Wulkan, like Mrs. Dresner and some fifteen thousand other
dwellers in the ghetto, knew that what was needed was a special and startling deliverance.
They did not believe for a moment that it would be provided.

<p/>CHAPTER 18
Dr. Sedlacek had promised an uncomfortable journey, and so it was. Oskar traveled in a
good overcoat with a suitcase and a bag full of various comforts which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) badly needed
by the end of the trip. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had the appropriate travel documents, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) did not want to
have to use them. It was considered better if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) did not have to present them at the border.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could always then deny that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had been to Hungary that December.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) rode in a freight van filled with bundles of the Party newspaper, V@olkischer
Beobachter, for sale in Hungary. Closeted with the redolence of printer's ink and among
the heavy Gothic print of Germany's official newspaper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Party</b></font>) was rocked south over the
winter-sharp mountains of Slovakia, across the Hungarian border, and down to the valley
of the Danube.
A reservation had been made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Party</b></font>) at the Pannonia, near the University, and on the
afternoon of his (<font color='blue'><b>Party</b></font>) arrival, little Samu Springmann and an associate of his (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>), Dr. Rezso
Kastner, came to see him (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>). The two men who rose to Schindler's floor in the elevator had
heard fragments of news from refugees. But refugees could give you little but threads.
The fact that they had avoided the threat meant that they knew little of its geography, its
intimate functioning, the numbers it ran to. Kastner and Springmann were full of
anticipation, since--if Sedlacek could be believed--the Sudeten German upstairs could
give them the whole cloth, the first full-bodied report on the Polish havoc.
In the room the introductions were brief, for
Springmann and Kastner had come to listen and they could tell that Schindler was
anxious to talk. There was no effort, in this city obsessed with coffee, to formalize the
event by calling Room Service for coffee and cakes. Kastner and Springmann, after
shaking the enormous German by the hand, sat down. But Schindler paced. It seemed
that far from Cracow and the realities of Aktion and ghetto, his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) knowledge disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
more than it had when he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d briefly informed Sedlacek. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) rampaged across the carpet.
They would have heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) steps in the room below--their chandelier would have shaken
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) stamped his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) foot, miming the action of the SS man in the execution squad in
Krakusa, the one who'd pinned his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) victim's head down with a boot in full sight of the red
child at the tail of the departing column.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) began with personal images of the cruel parishes of Cracow, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had beheld in
the streets or heard from either side of the wall, from Jews and from the SS. In that
connection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was carrying letters from members of the ghetto, from the
physician Chaim Hilfstein, from Dr. Leon Salpeter, from Itzhak Stern. Dr.
Hilfstein's letter, said Schindler, was a report on hunger. <div class="bookquote">``Once the body fat's gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said
Oskar, <div class="bookquote">``it starts to work on the brain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>The ghettos were being wound down, Oskar told them. It was true equally of Warsaw as
of @l@od@z and of Cracow. The population of the Warsaw ghetto had been reduced by
four-fifths, @l@od@z by two-thirds, Cracow by half. Where were the people who had
been transferred? Some were in work camps; but the gentlemen here this afternoon had to
accept that at least three-fifths of them had disappeared into camps that used the new
scientific methods. Such camps were not exceptional. They had an official SS name--
Vernichtungslager:
Extermination Camp.
In the past few weeks, said Oskar, some
2,000 Cracow ghetto dwellers had been
rounded up and sent not to the chambers of Bel@zec, but to labor camps near the city.
One was at Wieliczka, one at Prokocim, both of these being railway stations on the
Ostbahn line which ran toward the Russian front. From Wieliczka and Prokocim, these
prisoners were being marched every day to a site at the village of P@lasz@ow, on the
edge of the city, where the foundations for a vast labor camp were being laid.
Their life in such a labor camp, said
Schindler, would be no holiday--the barracks of Wieliczka and Prokocim were under the
command of an SS NCO named Horst Pilarzik who had earned a reputation last June
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pilarzik</b></font>) had helped clear from the ghetto some 7,000 people, of whom only one, a
chemist, had returned. The proposed camp at P@lasz@ow would be under a man of the
same caliber. What was in favor of the labor camps was that they lacked the technical
apparatus for methodical slaughter. There was a different rationale behind them. They
had economic reasons for existing--prisoners from Wieliczka and Prokocim were
marched out every day to work on various projects, just as they were from the ghetto.
Wieliczka, Prokocim, and the proposed camp
at P@lasz@ow were under the control of the chiefs of
police for Cracow, Julian Scherner and
Rolf Czurda, whereas the
Vernichtungslagers were run by the central management of the SS Administrative and
Economic Main Office at Oranienburg near Berlin. The Vernichtungslagers also used
people as labor for a time, but their ultimate industry was death and its by-products--the
recycling of the clothes, of remaining jewelry or spectacles, of toys, and even of the skin
and hair of the dead.
In the midst of explaining the distinction between extermination camps and those for
forced labor, Schindler suddenly stepped toward the door, wrenched it open, and looked
up and down the empty hallway. <div class="bookquote">``I know the reputation of this city for eavesdropping,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) explained. Little Mr. Springmann rose and came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Springmann</b></font>) elbow. <div class="bookquote">``The Pannonia isn't so
bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Springmann</b></font>) told Oskar in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``It's the Victoria that's the Gestapo hotbed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Schindler surveyed the hallway once more, closed the door, and returned across the
room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) stood by the windows and continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) grim report. The forced-labor camps
would be run by men appointed for their severity and efficiency in clearing the ghettos.
There would be sporadic murders and beatings, and there would certainly be corruption
involving food and therefore short rations for the prisoners. But that was preferable to the
assured death of the Vernichtungslagers. People in the labor camps could get access to
extra comforts, and individuals could be taken out and smuggled to Hungary.
These SS men are as corruptible as any other police force, then? the gentleman of the
Budapest rescue committee asked Oskar. <div class="bookquote">``In my experience,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>growled Oskar, <div class="bookquote">``there isn't
one of them who isn't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>When Oskar finished, there was, of course,
silence. Kastner and Springmann were not readily
astounded. All their lives they'd lived under the
intimidation of the Secret Police. Their
present activities were both vaguely
suspected by the Hungarian police--rendered
safe only by Samu's contacts and bribes--and
at the same time disdained by respectable
Jewry. Samuel Stern, for example,
president of the Jewish Council, member of the
Hungarian Senate, would dismiss this afternoon's
report by Oskar Schindler as pernicious
fantasy, an insult to German culture, a
reflection on the decency of the intentions of the Hungarian Government. These two were
used to hearing the worst.
So it was not that Springmann and Kastner were
unmanned by Schindler's testimony as much as that
their minds were painfully expanding. Their resources
seemed minute now that they knew what they were set
against--not just any average and predictable
Philistine giant, but Behemoth itself. Perhaps
already they were reaching for the idea that as well as
individual bargaining--some extra food for this
camp, rescue for this intellectual, a bribe
to temper the professional ardor of this SS man
--some vaster rescue scheme would have to be arranged at breathtaking expense.
Schindler threw himself into a chair. Samu Springmann looked across at the exhausted
industrialist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had made an enormous impression on them, said Springmann. They
would, of course, send a report to Istanbul on all Oskar had told them. It would be used to
stir the Palestinian Zionists and the Joint Distribution Committee to greater action. At the
same time it would be transmitted to the governments of Churchill and Roosevelt.
Springmann said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roosevelt</b></font>) thought Oskar was right to worry about people's belief in what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d say; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was right to say it was all incredible. <div class="bookquote">``Therefore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Springmann/Samu Springmann/Samu</b></font>)</div>said Samu Springmann,
<div class="bookquote">``I urge you to go to Istanbul yourself and speak to the people there.''  (<font color='red'><b>Springmann/Samu Springmann/Samu</b></font>)</div>After a little
hesitation--whether to do with the demands of the enamelware business or with the
dangers of crossing so many borders--Schindler agreed. Toward the end of the year,
said Springmann. <div class="bookquote">``In the meantime you will see Dr. Sedlacek in Cracow regularly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>They stood up, and Oskar could see that they were changed men. They thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) and
left, becoming simply, on the way downstairs, two pensive Budapest professional men
who'd heard disturbing news of mismanagement in the branch offices.
That night Dr. Sedlacek called at
Oskar's hotel and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) out into the brisk streets to dinner at the Hotel Gellert. From
their table they could see the Danube, its illuminated barges, the city glowing on the far
side of the water. It was like a prewar city, and Schindler began to feel like a tourist
again. After his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) afternoon's temperance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) drank the dense Hungarian burgundy called
Bull's Blood with a slow, assiduous thirst, and created a rank of empty bottles at their
table.
Halfway through their meal they were joined by an Austrian journalist, Dr. Schmidt,
who'd brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Schmidt</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Schmidt</b></font>) mistress, an exquisite, golden Hungarian girl. Schindler
admired the girl's jewelry and told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was a great fancier of gems himself. But
over apricot brandy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) became less friendly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) sat with a mild frown, listening to
Schmidt talk of real estate prices and automobile dealings and horse races. The girl
listened raptly to Schmidt, since she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wore the results of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schmidt</b></font>) business coups around her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
neck and at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wrists. But Oskar's unexpected disapproval was clear. Dr. Sedlacek was
secretly amused: perhaps Oskar was seeing a partial reflection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) own new wealth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
own tendencies toward trading on the fringes.
When the dinner was over, Schmidt and his (<font color='blue'><b>Schmidt</b></font>) girl left for some nightclub, and Sedlacek
made sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) took Schindler to a different one. They sat drinking unwise further
quantities of barack and watching the floor show.
<div class="bookquote">``That Schmidt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Schindler, wanting to clear up the question so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) could enjoy
the small hours. <div class="bookquote">``Do you use him (<font color='blue'><b>Schmidt</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you ought to use men like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Schmidt</b></font>)'s a thief.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sedlacek/Dr. Sedlacek</b></font>)</div>Dr. Sedlacek turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) face, and its
half-smile, away.
<div class="bookquote">``How can you be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Schmidt</b></font>) delivers any of the money you give him (<font color='blue'><b>Schmidt</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar asked.
<div class="bookquote">``We let him (<font color='blue'><b>Schmidt</b></font>) keep a percentage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sedlacek/Dr. Sedlacek</b></font>)</div>said
Dr. Sedlacek.
Oskar thought about it for a full half-minute. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want a damned
percentage. I don't want to be offered one.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sedlacek/Dr. Sedlacek</b></font>)</div>said Sedlacek.
<div class="bookquote">``Let's watch the girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar.

<p/>CHAPTER 19
Even as Oskar Schindler returned by freight
car from Budapest, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d predicted that the
ghetto would soon be closed, an SS
Untersturmf@uhrer named Amon Goeth was
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) way from Lublin to bring about that liquidation,
and to take command of the resultant Forced Labor
Camp -LRB-Zwangsarbeitslager-RRB- at
P@lasz@ow. Goeth was some eight months younger
than Schindler, but shared more with him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) than the mere
year of birth. Like Oskar he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had been raised a
Catholic and had ceased observing the rites of the
Church as late as 1938, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) first marriage
had broken up. Like Oskar too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had
graduated from high school in the
Realgymnasium--Engineering, Physics,
Math. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was therefore a practical man, no thinker, but considered himself a philosopher.
A Viennese, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had joined the National
Socialist Party early, in 1930. When the
nervous Austrian Republic banned the party in 1933, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was already a member of its
security force, the SS. Driven underground, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had emerged onto the streets of Vienna
after the Anschluss of 1938 in the uniform of an SS noncommissioned officer. In 1940 he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
had been raised to the rank of SS Oberscharf@uhrer and in 1941 achieved the honor of
commissioned rank, immensely harder to come by in the SS than in Wehrmacht units.
After training in infantry tactics, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was put in charge of Sonderkommandos during
Aktionen in the populous ghetto of Lublin and, by his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) performance there, earned the right
to liquidate Cracow.
Untersturmf@uhrer Amon Goeth then, speeding on the Wehrmacht special between
Lublin and Cracow, there to take command of well-tried Sonderkommandos, shared with
Oskar not only his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) year of birth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) religion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) weakness for liquor, but a massive
physique as well. Goeth's face was open and pleasant, rather longer than Schindler's. His (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
hands, though large and muscular, were long-fingered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was sentimental about his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
children, the children of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) second marriage whom, because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) foreign service, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
had not seen often in the past three years. As a substitute, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was sometimes attentive to
the children of brother officers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) could be a sentimental lover too, but though he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
resembled Oskar in terms of general sexual voraciousness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) tastes were less
conventional, running sometimes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) brother SS men, frequently to the beating of
women. Both his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) former wives could have testified that once the first blaze of infatuation
had died, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could become physically abusive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) considered himself a sensitive man,
and thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) family's trade proved it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) father and grandfather were Viennese
printers and binders of books on military and economic history, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) liked to list
himself on official papers as a Literat: a man of letters. And though, at this moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would have told you that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked forward to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) taking of control of the liquidation
operation--that this was the major chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) career and carried with it the promise of
promotion-- his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) service in Special Actions seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to have altered the flow of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
nervous energies. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been plagued with insomnia for two years now and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way, stayed up till three or four and slept late in the mornings. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had become a
reckless drinker and believed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liquor with an ease he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not known in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
youth. Again like Oskar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) never suffered the hangovers he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) deserved. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) thanked his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
hardworking kidneys for this benefit.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) orders, entrusting him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) with the extinction of the ghetto and the kingship of the
P@lasz@ow camp, were dated February 12, 1943. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) hoped that after consulting with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) senior NCO'S, with Wilhelm Kunde, commander of the SS guard detail for the
ghetto, and with Willi Haase, Scherner's deputy, it would be possible to begin the
clearing of the ghetto within a month of the date on his (<font color='blue'><b>Haase</b></font>) commission.
Commandant Goeth was met at the Cracow Central Station by Kunde himself and by the
tall young SS man Horst Pilarzik, who was temporarily in charge of the work camps at
Prokocim and Wieliczka. They piled into the back of a Mercedes and were driven off for
a reconnaissance of the ghetto and the site of the new camp. It was a bitter day, and snow
began to fall as they crossed the Vistula.
Untersturmf@uhrer Goeth was pleased for a pull on a flask of schnapps Pilarzik carried
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pilarzik</b></font>). They passed through the fake-Oriental portals and down the trolley lines of
Lw@owska Street, which cut the ghetto into two icy portions. The dapper Kunde, who
had been a customs agent in civilian life and was adept at reporting to superiors, gave a
deft sketch of the ghetto. The portion on their left was Ghetto B, said Kunde.
Its inhabitants, about 2,000 of them, had
escaped earlier Aktionen or had been
previously employed in industry. But new
identification cards had been issued since then,
with appropriate initials--either W for Army
employees, Z for employees of the civil
authorities, or R for workers in essential
industries. The inhabitants of Ghetto B
lacked these new cards and were to be shipped away for Sonderbehandlung -LRB-special
Treatment-RRB-.
In clearing the ghetto, it might be preferable to start on that side first, though that sort of
tactical decision was entirely up to the Herr Commandant.
The greater portion of the ghetto stood to the right and contained some 10,000 people
still. They would of course be the initial labor force for the factories of the P@lasz@ow
camp. It was expected that the German entrepreneurs and supervisors--
Bosch, Madritsch, Beckmann, the
Sudetenlander Oskar Schindler--would want to move all or part of their operations out of
town into the camp. As well as that there was a cable-making plant no more than half a
mile from the proposed camp, and laborers would be marched there and back each day.
Would the Herr Commandant, asked Kunde, care to continue down the road a few
kilometers and have a look at the campsite itself?
Oh, yes, said Amon, I think that would be advisable.
They turned off the highway where the cable-factory yard, snow lying on the giant
spools, marked the beginning of Jerozolimska Street. Amon Goeth had a glimpse of a few
groups of hunched and bescarved women dragging segments of huts--a wall panel, an
eaves section--across the highway and up Jerozolimska from the direction of the railway
station at Cracow-P@lasz@ow. They were women from the Prokocim camp, Pilarzik
explained. When P@lasz@ow was ready, Prokocim would of course be disbanded and
these laboring women would come under the management of the Herr Commandant.
Goeth estimated the distance the women had to carry the frames to be some threequarters
of a kilometer. <div class="bookquote">``All uphill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kunde/Wilhelm Kunde</b></font>)</div>said Kunde, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Kunde</b></font>) head on one shoulder, then
on the other, as if to say, So it's a satisfactory form of discipline, but it slows up
construction.
The camp would need a railway spur, said Untersturmf@uhrer Goeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kunde</b></font>) would make an
approach to Ostbahn.
They passed on the right a synagogue and its mortuary buildings, and a half-tumbled wall
showed gravestones like teeth in the cruelly exposed mouth of winter. Part of the
campsite had been until this month a Jewish cemetery. <div class="bookquote">``Quite extensive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kunde/Wilhelm Kunde</b></font>)</div>said Wilhelm
Kunde. The Herr Commandant uttered a witticism which would come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) lips often
during his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) residency at P@lasz@ow. <div class="bookquote">``They won't have to go far to get buried.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Commandant</b></font>)</div>There was a house to the right which would be suitable as a temporary residence for the
Commandant, and then a large new building to serve as an administration center. The
synagogue mortuary, already partly dynamited, would become the camp stable. Kunde
pointed out that the two limestone quarries within the camp area could be seen from here.
One stood in the bottom of the little valley, the other up on the hill behind the synagogue.
The Herr Commandant might be able to notice the tracks being laid for trolleys which
would be used in hauling stones. Once the heavy weather let up, the construction of the
track would continue.
They drove to the southeast end of the proposed camp, and a trail, just passable in the
snow, took them along the skyline. The trail ended at what had once been an Austrian
military earthwork, a circular mound surrounding a deep and broad indentation. To an
artilleryman it would have appeared an important redoubt from which cannon could be
sighted to enfilade the road from Russia. To Untersturmf@uhrer Goeth it was a place
suited for disciplinary punishment. From up here, the camp area could be seen whole.
It was a rural stretch, graced with the Jewish
cemetery, and folded between two hills. It was in
this weather two pages of a largely blank book
opened and held at an angle, sideways, to the
observer on the fort hill. A gray, stone
country dwelling was stuck at the entrance to the
valley, and past it, along the far slope and
among the few finished barracks, moved teams of
women, black as bunches of musical
notations, in the strange darkling luminescence of a
snowy evening. Emerging from the icy alleys beyond
Jerozolimska, they toiled up the white slope
under the urgings of Ukrainian guards and dropped
the sections of frames where the SS engineers,
wearing homburgs and civilian clothes,
instructed them.
Their rate of work was a limitation,
Untersturmf@uhrer Goeth remarked. The ghetto people could not, of course, be moved
here until the barracks were up and the watchtowers and fences completed. He (<font color='blue'><b>guards</b></font>) had no
complaints about the pace at which the prisoners on the far hill were working, he (<font color='blue'><b>guards</b></font>) told
them, confidingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>guards</b></font>) was in fact secretly impressed that so late on a biting day, the SS
men and Ukrainians on the far slope were not letting the thought of supper and warm
barracks slow the pace of operations.
Horst Pilarzik assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Pilarzik</b></font>) that it was all closer to completion than it looked: the land had
been terraced, the foundations dug despite the cold, and a great quantity of prefabricated
sections carried up from the railway station. The Herr Untersturmf@uhrer would be able
to consult with the entrepreneurs tomorrow--a meeting had been arranged for 10 A.m..
But modern methods combined with a copious supply of labor meant that these places
could be put up almost overnight, weather permitting. Pilarzik seemed to believe that
Goeth was in genuine danger of demoralization. In fact Amon was exhilarated. From
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) could see here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) could discern the final shape of the place. Nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) worried
about fences. The fences would be a mental comfort to the prisoners rather than an
essential precaution. For after the established methodology of SS liquidation had been
applied to the Podg@orze ghetto, people would be grateful for the barracks of
P@lasz@ow. Even those with Aryan papers would come crawling in here, seeking an
obscure berth high up in the green, hoarfrosted rooftrees. For most of them, the wire was
needed only as a prop, so that they might reassure themselves that they were prisoners
against their will.
The meeting with the local factory owners and
Treuh@anders took place in Julian
Scherner's office in central Cracow early the
following day. Amon Goeth arrived smiling
fraternally and, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) freshly tailored
Waffen SS uniform, designed precisely
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) enormous frame, seemed to dominate the
room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) could charm the
independents, Bosch and Madritsch and
Schindler, into transferring their Jewish labor
behind camp wire. Besides that, an investigation of the
skills available among the ghetto dwellers
helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) to see that P@lasz@ow could become quite
a business. There were jewelers, upholsterers,
tailors who could be used for special
enterprises under the Commandant's direction,
filling orders for the SS, the Wehrmacht, the
wealthy German officialdom. There would be the
clothing workshops of Madritsch, the enamel
factory of Schindler, a proposed metal
plant, a brush factory, a warehouse for
recycling used, damaged, or stained
Wehrmacht uniforms from the Russian
Front, a further warehouse for recycling
Jewish clothing from the ghettos and dispatching it for the
use of bombed-out families at home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
knew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) experiences of the SS jewelry and
fur warehouses of Lublin, having seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
superiors at work there and taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) proper cut,
that from most of these prison enterprises he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) could
expect a personal percentage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had reached
that happy point in his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) career at which duty and
financial opportunity coincided. The
convivial SS police chief, Julian
Scherner, over dinner last night, had talked to Amon about what a great opportunity
P@lasz@ow would be for a young officer--for them both. Scherner opened the meeting
with the factory people. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) spoke solemnly about the <div class="bookquote">``concentration of labor,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as if it
were a great economic principle new-hatched by the SS bureaucracy. You'll have your
labor on site, said Scherner. All factory maintenance will be undertaken at no cost to
you, and there will be no rent. All the gentlemen were invited to inspect the workshop
sites inside P@lasz@ow that afternoon.
The new Commandant was introduced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) said how pleased he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) was to be associated with
these businessmen whose valuable contributions to the war effort were already widely
known.
Amon pointed out on a map of the camp area the section set aside for the factories. It was
next to the men's camp; the women--he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) told them with an easy and quite charming
smile--would have to walk a little farther, one or two hundred meters downhill, to reach
the workshops. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) assured the gentlemen that his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) main task was to oversee the smooth
functioning of the camp and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had no wish to interfere with their factory policies or
to alter the managerial autonomy they enjoyed here in Cracow. His (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) orders, as
Oberf@uhrer Scherner could verify, forbade in so many words that sort of intrusion. But
the Oberf@uhrer had been correct in pointing out the mutual advantages of moving an
industry inside the camp perimeter. The factory owners did not have to pay for the
premises, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>), the Commandant, did not have to provide a guard to march the
prisoners to town and back. They could understand how the length of the journey and the
hostility of the Poles to a column of Jews would erode the worth of the workers.
Throughout this speech, Commandant Goeth glanced frequently at Madritsch and
Schindler, the two he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) particularly wished to win over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) could already depend
on Bosch's local knowledge and advice. But Herr Schindler, for example, had a
munitions section, small and merely in the developmental stage as yet. It would,
however, if transferred, give P@lasz@ow a great respectability with the Armaments
Inspectorate.
Herr Madritsch listened with a considered frown, and Herr Schindler watched the speaker
with an acquiescent half-smile. Commandant Goeth could tell instinctively, even before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d finished speaking, that Madritsch would be reasonable and move in, that Schindler
would refuse. It was hard to judge by these separate decisions which one of the two felt
more paternal toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) Jews--
Madritsch, who wanted to be inside
P@lasz@ow with them, or Schindler, who wanted to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) in Emalia.
Oskar Schindler, wearing that same face of avid tolerance, went with the party to inspect
the campsite. P@lasz@ow had the form of a camp now--an improvement in the weather
had permitted the assembly of barracks; a thawing of the ground permitted the digging of
latrines and postholes. A Polish construction company had installed the miles of
perimeter fence. Thick-legged watchtowers were going up along the skyline toward
Cracow, and also at the mouth of the valley down toward Wieliczka Street, away at the
far end of the camp, and up here on this eastern hill where the official party, in the
shadow of the Austrian hill fort, watched the fast work of this new creation. Off to the
right, Oskar noticed, women were hustling up muddy tracks in the direction of the
railway, heavy sections of barracks tilted between them. Below, from the lowest point of
the valley and all the way up the far side, the terraced barracks ran, assembled by male
prisoners who raised and slotted and hammered with an energy which at this distance
resembled willingness.
On the choicest, most level ground beneath the official party, a number of long wooden
structures were available for industrial occupation. Cement floors could be poured
should heavy machinery need to be installed. The transfer of all plant machinery would
be handled by the SS. The road that serviced the area was admittedly little more than a
country track, but the engineering firm of Klug had been approached to build a central
street for the camp, and the Ostbahn had promised to provide a spur to the camp gate
itself, to the quarry down there on the right. Limestone from the quarries and some of
what Goeth called <div class="bookquote">``Polish-defaced''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>gravestones from over in the cemetery would be
broken up to provide other interior roads. The gentlemen should not worry about roads,
said Goeth, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Klug</b></font>) intended to maintain a permanently strong quarrying and road-building
team.
A small railroad had been laid for the rock trolleys. It ran from the quarry up past the
Administration Building and the large stone barracks that were being built for the SS and
Ukrainian garrison. Trolleys of limestone, each weighing six tons, were hauled by teams
of women, thirty-five or forty of them to a team, dragging on cables set either side of the
rock truck, to compensate for the unevenness in the rail line. Those who tripped or
stumbled were trampled or else rolled out of the way, for the teams had their own organic
momentum and no individual could abdicate from it. Watching this insidious Egyptianlooking
industry, Oskar felt the same surge of nausea, the same prickling of the blood he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
had experienced on the hill above Krakusa Street. Goeth had assumed the businessmen
were a safe audience, that they were all spiritual kinfolk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was not embarrassed
by that savage hauling down there. The question arose, as it had in Krakusa Street: What
could embarrass the SS? What could embarrass Amon?
The energy of the barracks builders had, even to an informed observer like Oskar, the
specious appearance of men working hard to put up shelter for their women. But though
Oskar had not yet heard the rumor of it, Amon had performed a summary execution in
front of those men this morning, so that now they knew what the full terms of their labor
were. After the early-morning meeting with the engineers, Amon had been strolling down
Jerozolimska and had come to the SS barracks where the work was under the supervision
of an excellent NCO, soon to be promoted to officer rank, named Albert Hujar. Hujar
had marched up and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Hujar</b></font>) report. A section of the foundations of the barracks had
collapsed, said Hujar, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hujar</b></font>) face flushed. At the same time, Amon had noticed a girl
walking around the half-finished building, speaking to teams of men, pointing, directing.
Who was that? he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) asked Hujar. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a prisoner named Diana Reiter, said Hujar, an
architectural engineer who had been assigned to the construction of the barracks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Reiter</b></font>) was
claiming that the foundations hadn't been correctly excavated, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Reiter</b></font>) wanted all the
stone and cement dug up and the work on that section of the building to begin again from
scratch. Goeth had been able to tell from the color of Hujar's face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hujar</b></font>) had had a
tough argument with the woman. Hujar had, in fact, been reduced to screaming at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``You're building barracks, not the frigging Hotel Europa!''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Now Amon half-smiled at Hujar.
We're not going to have arguments with these people, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hujar</b></font>) said, as if it were a promise.
Bring me the girl.
Amon could tell, from the way she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) walked toward
him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>), the bogus elegance with which her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) middle-class
parents had raised her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), the European manners
they had imbued her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with, sending her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--when the honest
Poles wouldn't take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in their universities
--off to Vienna or Milan to give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a
profession and a heightened protective coloration. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) walked toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) rank
and hers would bind them in the battle against oafish NCO'S and the inferior craft of
whichever SS engineer had supervised the digging of the foundations. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not know
that he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the worst--the type who thought, even against the evidence of his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) SS
uniform, of these rising structures, that their Jewishness was not visible.
<div class="bookquote">``You've had occasion to quarrel with
Oberscharf@uhrer Hujar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>Goeth told
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as a fact. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nodded firmly. The Herr
Commandant would understand, the nod suggested, even though that idiot Hujar
couldn't. The entire foundations at that end must be redug, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hujar</b></font>) energetically. Of
course, Amon knew <div class="bookquote">``they''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>were like that, they liked to string out tasks and so ensure that
the labor force was safe for the duration of the project. If everything is not redug, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>), there will be at least subsidence at the southern end of the barracks. There could be
collapse. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went on arguing the case, and Amon nodded and presumed she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must be
lying. It was a first principle that you never listened to a Jewish specialist. Jewish
specialists were in the mold of Marx, whose theories were aimed at the integrity of
government, and of Freud, who had assaulted the integrity of the Aryan mind. Amon felt
that this girl's argument threatened his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) personal integrity.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) called Hujar. The NCO returned
uneasily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hujar</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Hujar</b></font>) was going to be told
to take the girl's advice. The girl did
too. Shoot her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), Amon told Hujar. There
was, of course, a pause while Hujar
digested the order. Shoot her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), Amon repeated. Hujar took the girl's elbow to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
away to some place of private execution. Here! said Amon. Shoot her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) here! On my
authority, said Amon.
Hujar knew how it was done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hujar</b></font>) gripped her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) by the elbow, pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a little to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hujar</b></font>) front,
took the Mauser from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hujar</b></font>) holster, and shot her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in the back of the neck.
The sound appalled everyone on the work site, except--it seemed--the executioners and
the dying Miss Diana Reiter herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Reiter</b></font>) knelt and looked up once. It will take more than
that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Reiter</b></font>) was saying. The knowingness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Reiter</b></font>) eyes frightened Amon, justified him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>),
elevated him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had no idea and would not have believed that these reactions had
clinical labels. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) believed, in fact, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was being awarded the inevitable exaltation
that follows an act of political, racial, and moral justice. Even so, a man paid for that, for
by evening the fullness of this hour would be followed by such emptiness that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
need, to avoid being blown away like a husk, to augment his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) size and permanence by
food, liquor, contact with a woman.
Apart from these considerations, the shooting of this
Diana Reiter, the cancelling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Reiter</b></font>) Western
European diploma, had this practical
value: that no erector of huts or roads in
P@lasz@ow would consider himself essential to the task--that if Miss Diana Reiter
could not save herself with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Reiter</b></font>) professional skill, the only chance of the others was
prompt and anonymous labor. Therefore the women lugging frames up from the CracowP@lasz@ow
railway station, the quarry teams, the men assembling the huts all worked
with an energy appropriate to what they'd learned from Miss Reiter's assassination.
As for Hujar and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hujar</b></font>) colleagues, they knew now that instantaneous execution was to be
the permitted style of P@lasz@ow.

<p/>CHAPTER 20
Two days after the visit of the factory heads to P@lasz@ow, Schindler turned up at
Commandant Goeth's temporary office in the city, bringing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) the compliments of
a bottle of brandy. The news of Diana Reiter's assassination had by this time reached the
front office of Emalia and was the sort of item that confirmed Oskar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) intention to
keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) factory outside P@lasz@ow.
The two big men sat opposite each other and there was a mutual knowingness in them
too, just as there had been in the brief relationship between Amon and Miss Reiter. What
they knew was that each of them was in Cracow to make a fortune; that therefore Oskar
would pay for favors. At that level Oskar and the Commandant understood each other
well. Oskar had the characteristic salesman's gift of treating men he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) abhorred as if they
were spiritual brothers, and it would deceive the Herr Commandant so completely that
Amon would always believe Oskar a friend.
But from the evidence of Stern and others it is
obvious that, from the time of their earlier contacts,
Oskar abominated Goeth as a man who went to the
work of murder as calmly as a clerk goes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
office. Oskar could speak to Amon the
administrator, Amon the speculator, but
knew at the same time that nine-tenths of the Commandant's being lay beyond the normal
rational processes of humans. The business and social connections between Oskar and
Amon worked well enough to tempt the supposition that Oskar was somehow and despite
himself fascinated by the evil of the man. In fact, no one who knew Oskar at this time or
later saw a sign of any such enthrallment. Oskar despised Goeth in the simplest and most
passionate terms. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) contempt would grow without limit, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) career would
dramatically demonstrate it. Just the same, the reflection can hardly be avoided that
Amon was Oskar's dark brother, was the berserk and fanatic executioner Oskar might, by
some unhappy reversal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) appetites, have become.
With a bottle of brandy between them, Oskar explained to Amon why it was impossible
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to move into P@lasz@ow. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) plant was too substantial to be shifted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
believed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) friend Madritsch intended to move his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) Jewish workers in, but Madritsch's
machinery was more easily transferred--it was basically a series of sewing machines.
There were different problems involved in moving heavy metal presses, each of which, as
a sophisticated machine will, had developed special quirks. His (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) skilled workers had
become accustomed to these quirks. But on a new factory floor the machines would
display an entirely new set of eccentricities. There'd be delays; the settling-in period
would take longer than it would for his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) esteemed friend Julius Madritsch. The
Untersturmf@uhrer would understand that with important war contracts to fulfill, DEF
could not spare such a lapse of time. Herr Beckmann, who had the same sort of problem,
was firing all his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) Jews over at the Corona works. He (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) didn't want the fuss of the Jews
marching out from P@lasz@ow to the factory in the morning and back in the evenings.
Unfortunately, he (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>), Schindler, had hundreds more skilled Jewish workers than Beckmann
did. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Beckmann</b></font>) got rid of them, Poles would have to be trained in their place and there would
again be a production delay, an even greater one than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Beckmann</b></font>) accepted Goeth's attractive
offer and moved into P@lasz@ow.
Amon secretly thought that Oskar might be worried that a move into P@lasz@ow would
impinge on any sweetly running little deals he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had going in Cracow. The Commandant
therefore hurried to reassure Herr Schindler that there'd be no interference in the
management of the enamel factory. <div class="bookquote">``It's purely the industrial problems that worry me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Schindler piously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) didn't want to inconvenience the Commandant, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) would
be grateful, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was sure the Armaments Inspectorate would also be grateful, if DEF
were permitted to stay in its present location.
Among men like Goeth and Oskar, the word <div class="bookquote">``gratitude''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>did not have an abstract
meaning. Gratitude was a payoff. Gratitude was liquor and diamonds. I understand your
problems, Herr Schindler, said Amon. I shall be happy, once the ghetto is liquidated, to
provide a guard to escort your workers from P@lasz@ow to Zablocie.
Itzhak Stern, coming to Zablocie one afternoon on business for the Progress factory,
found Oskar depressed and sensed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) a dangerous feeling of impotence. After
Klonowska had brought in the coffee, which the Herr Direktor drank as always with a
shot of cognac, Oskar told Stern that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d been to P@lasz@ow again: ostensibly to look
at the facilities; in fact to gauge when it would be ready for the Ghettomenschen. <div class="bookquote">``I took
a count,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d counted the terraced barracks on the far hill and found that if
Amon intended to cram 200 women into each, as was likely, there was now room for
some 6,000 women up there in the top compound. The men's sector down the hill did not
have so many finished buildings, but at the rate things were done in P@lasz@ow it could
be finished in days. Everyone on the factory floor knows what's going to happen, said
Oskar. And it's no use keeping the night shift on the premises here, because after this
one, there'll be no ghetto to go back to. All I can tell them, said Oskar, taking a second
slug of cognac, is that they shouldn't try to hide unless they're sure of the hiding place.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d heard that the pattern was to tear the ghetto apart after it had been cleared. Every
wall cavity would be probed, every attic carpet taken up, every niche revealed, every
cellar plumbed.
All I can tell them, said Oskar, is not
to resist.
So it happened oddly that Stern, one of the targets of the coming Aktion, sat comforting
Herr Direktor Schindler, a mere witness.
Oskar's attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) Jewish laborers was being diffused, tempted away by the wider
tragedy of the ghetto's coming end. P@lasz@ow was a labor institution, said Stern. Like
all institutions, it could be outlived. It wasn't like Bel@zec, where they made death in the
same manner in which Henry Ford made cars. It was degrading to have to line up for
P@lasz@ow on orders, but it wasn't the end of things. When Stern had finished arguing,
Oskar put both thumbs under the beveled top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) desk and seemed for a few seconds to
want to tear it off. You know, Stern, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) said, that that's damn well not good enough! It
is, said Stern. It's the only course.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) went on arguing, quoting and hairsplitting, and was himself frightened. For Oskar
seemed to be in crisis. If Oskar lost hope, Stern knew, all the Jewish workers of Emalia
would be fired, for Oskar would wish to be purified of the entire dirty business.
There'll be time to do something more positive, said Stern. But not yet.
Abandoning the attempt to tear the lid from his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) desk, Oskar sat back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) chair and
resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) depression. <div class="bookquote">``You know that Amon Goeth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>)'s got charm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>)
could come in here now and charm you. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>)'s a lunatic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>On the ghetto's last morning--a
Shabbat, as it happened, March 13--Amon Goeth arrived in Plac Zgody, Peace Square, at
an hour which officially preceded dawn. Low clouds obscured any sharp distinctions
between night and day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) saw that the men of the Sonderkommando had already arrived
and stood about on the frozen earth of the small park in the middle, smoking and
laughing quietly, keeping their presence a secret from the ghetto dwellers in the streets
beyond Herr Pankiewicz' pharmacy. The roads down which they'd move were clear, as
in a model of a town. The remaining snow lay heaped and tarnished in gutters and against
walls. It is safe to guess that sentimental Goeth felt paternal as he (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) looked out at the
orderly scene and saw the young men, comradely before action, in the middle of the
square.
Amon took a pull of cognac while he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
waited there for the middle-aged
Sturmbannf@uhrer Willi Haase, who
would have strategic, though not tactical, control of today's Aktion. Today Ghetto A,
from Plac Zgody westward, the major section of the ghetto, the one where all the working
-LRB-healthy, hoping, opinionated-RRB- Jews dwelt, would be emptied. Ghetto B, a small
compound a few blocks square at the eastern end of the ghetto, contained the old, the last
of the unemployable. They would be uprooted overnight, or tomorrow. They were slated
for Commandant Rudolf H@oss's greatly expanded extermination camp at Auschwitz.
Ghetto B was straightforward, honest work. Ghetto A was the challenge.
Everyone wanted to be here today, for today was
history. There had been for more than seven
centuries a Jewish Cracow, and by this evening--
or at least by tomorrow--those seven centuries would have
become a rumor, and Cracow would be
judenrein -LRB-clean of Jews-RRB-. And every petty
SS official wanted to be able to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) had
seen it happen. Even Unkelbach, the
Treuh@ander of the Progress cutlery
factory, having some sort of reserve SS
rank, would put on his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) NCO'S uniform today and move through the ghetto with one of
the squads. Therefore the distinguished Willi Haase, being of field rank and involved in
the planning, had every right to be counted in.
Amon would be suffering his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) customary minor headache and be feeling a little drained
from the feverish insomnia in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)'d spent the small hours. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was here,
though, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) felt a certain professional exhilaration. It was a great gift which the National
Socialist Party had given to the men of the SS, that they could go into battle without
physical risk, that they could achieve honor without the contingencies that plagued the
whole business of being shot at. Psychological impunity had been harder to achieve.
Every SS officer had friends who had committed suicide. SS training documents, written
to combat these futile casualties, pointed out the simplemindedness of believing that
because the Jew bore no visible weapons he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was bereft of social, economic, or political
arms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was, in fact, armed to the teeth. Steel yourself, said the documents, for the
Jewish child is a cultural time bomb, the Jewish woman a biology of treasons, the Jewish
male a more incontrovertible enemy than any Russian could hope to be.
Amon Goeth was steeled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) could not be touched, and the very thought of that
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) the same delicious excitement a long-distance runner might have before an
event he (<font color='blue'><b>runner</b></font>) feels sure about. Amon despised in a genial sort of way those officers who
fastidiously left the act itself to their men and NCO'S. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) sensed that in some way that
might be more dangerous than lending a hand yourself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would show the way, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
had with Diana Reiter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) knew the euphoria that would build during the day, the
gratification that would grow, along with a taste for liquor, as noon came and the pace
picked up. Even under the low squalor of those clouds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) knew that this was one of the
best days, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was old and the race extinct, the young would ask with wonder
about days like this.
Less than a kilometer away, a doctor of the ghetto's convalescent hospital, Dr. H, sat
among his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) last patients, in darkness, grateful that they were isolated like this on the
hospital's top floor, high above the street, alone with their pain and fever.
For at street level everyone knew what had
happened at the epidemic hospital near
Plac Zgody. An SS detachment under
Oberscharf@uhrer Albert Hujar had
entered the hospital to close it down and had found
Dr. Rosalia Blau standing among the beds of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Blau</b></font>) scarlet fever and tuberculosis patients,
who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Blau</b></font>) said, should not be moved. The whooping cough
children she (<font color='blue'><b>Blau</b></font>) had sent home earlier. But the scarlet
fever sufferers were too dangerous to move, both for
their own sakes and for the community's, and the
tuberculosis cases were simply too sick
to walk out.
Since scarlet fever is an adolescent
disease, many of Dr. Blau's patients were girls between the age of twelve and sixteen.
Faced with Albert Hujar, Dr. Blau pointed, as warranty for her (<font color='blue'><b>Blau</b></font>) professional judgment, to
these wide-eyed, feverish girls. Hujar himself, acting on the mandate he (<font color='blue'><b>Hujar</b></font>)'d received the
week before from Amon Goeth, shot Dr.
Blau in the head. The infectious patients, some
trying to rise in their beds, some detached in their own
delirium, were executed in a rage of
automatic fire. When Hujar's squad had
finished, a detail of ghetto men was sent up the stairs to deal with the dead, to pile the
bloodied linen, and to wash down the walls.
The convalescent hospital was situated in what had been before the war a Polish police
station. Throughout the life of the ghetto, its three floors had been cluttered with the sick.
Its director was a respected physician named Dr. B. By the bleak morning of March 13,
Doctors B and H had reduced its population to four, all of them immovable. One was a
young workman with galloping consumption; the second, a talented musician with
terminal kidney disease. It seemed important to Dr. H that they somehow be spared the
final panic of a mad volley of fire. Even more so the blind man afflicted by a stroke, and
the old gentleman whose earlier surgery for an intestinal tumor had left him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) weakened
and burdened with a colostomy. The medical staff here, Dr. H included, were of the
highest caliber. From this ill-equipped ghetto hospital would derive the first Polish
accounts of Weil's erythroblastic disease, a condition of the bone marrow, and of the
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. This morning, though, Dr. H was concerned with the
question of cyanide. With an eye to the option of suicide, H had acquired a supply of
cyanic acid solution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weil</b></font>) knew that other doctors had too. This past year depression had
been endemic to the ghetto. It had infected Dr. H. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weil</b></font>) was young; he (<font color='blue'><b>Weil</b></font>) was formidably
healthy. Yet history itself seemed to have gone malignant. To know he (<font color='blue'><b>Weil</b></font>) had access to
cyanide had been a comfort for Dr. H on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weil</b></font>) worst days. By this late stage of the ghetto's
history, it was the one pharmaceutical left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weil</b></font>) and to the other doctors in quantity.
There had rarely been any sulfa. Emetics, ether, and even aspirin were used up. Cyanide
was the single sophisticated drug remaining.
This morning before five, Dr. H had been awakened in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weil</b></font>) room in Wit Stwosz Street by
the noise of trucks pulling up beyond the wall. Looking down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Weil</b></font>) window, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weil</b></font>) saw
the Sonderkommandos assembling by the river and knew that they had come to take
some decisive action in the ghetto. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weil</b></font>) rushed to the hospital and found Dr. B and the
nursing staff already working there on the same premise, arranging for every patient who
could move to be taken downstairs and brought home by relatives or friends. When all
except the four had gone, Dr. B told the nurses to leave, and all of them obeyed except
for one senior nurse. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) and Doctors B and H remained with the last four patients
in the nearly deserted hospital.
Doctors B and H did not speak much as they waited. They each had access to the
cyanide, and soon H would be aware that Dr. B's mind was also sadly preoccupied with
it. There was suicide, yes. But there was euthanasia as well. The concept terrified H. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dr.</b></font>)
had a sensitive face and a marked delicacy about the eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dr.</b></font>) suffered painfully from a
set of ethics as intimate to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dr.</b></font>) as the organs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dr.</b></font>) own body. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dr.</b></font>) knew that a physician
with common sense and a syringe and little else to guide him (<font color='blue'><b>Dr.</b></font>) could add up like a
shopping list the values of either course--to inject the cyanide, or to abandon the patients
to the Sonderkommando. But H knew that these things were never a matter of calculating
sums, that ethics was higher and more tortuous than algebra.
Sometimes Dr. B would go to the window, look out to see if the Aktion had begun in the
streets, and turn back to H with a level, professional calm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dr.</b></font>) eyes. Dr. B, H could tell,
was also running through the options, flicking the faces of the problem like the faces of
riffled cards, then starting again. Suicide. Euthanasia.
Hydrocyanic acid. One appealing concept:
Stand and be found among the beds like Rosalia Blau. Another: Use the cyanide on
oneself as well as on the sick. The second idea appealed to H, seeming not as passive as
the first. As well as that, waking depressed these past three nights, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dr.</b></font>)'d felt something
like a physical desire for the fast poison, as if it were merely the drug or stiff drink that
every victim needed to soften the final hour.
To a serious man like Dr. H, this allure was a compelling reason not to take the stuff. For
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the precedents for suicide had been set in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scholarly childhood, when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father
had read to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in Josephus the account of the Dead Sea Zealots' mass suicide on the eve
of capture by the Romans. The principle was, death should not be entered like some snug
harbor. It should be an unambiguous refusal to surrender. Principle is principle, of course,
and terror on a gray morning is another thing. But H was a man of principle.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife had another escape route, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew it. It led
through the sewers near the corner of Piwna and Krakusa Streets. The sewers and a risky
escape to the forest of Ojc@ow. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feared that more than the easy oblivion of cyanide. If
Blue Police or Germans stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), however, and dragged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trousers down, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
pass the test, thanks to Dr. Lachs. Lachs was a distinguished plastic surgeon who had
taught a number of young Cracow Jews how to lengthen their foreskins bloodlessly by
sleeping with a weight--a bottle containing a gradually increasing volume of water--
attached to themselves. It was, said Lachs, a device that had been used by Jews in periods
of Roman persecution, and the intensity of SS action in Cracow had caused Lachs to
revive its use in the past eighteen months. Lachs had taught his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) young colleague Dr. H
the method, and the fact that it had worked with some success allowed H even less
ground for suicide.
At dawn the nurse, a calm woman about
forty years old, came to Dr. H and made a
morning report. The young man was resting well, but
the blind man with the stroke-affected speech was in a
state of anxiety. The musician and the
anal-fistula case had both had a painful
night. It was all very quiet in the convalescent hospital now, however; the patients
snuffled in the last of their sleep or the intimacy of their pain; and Dr. H went out onto
the freezing balcony above the courtyard to smoke a cigarette and once more examine the
question. Last year Dr. H had been at the old epidemic hospital in Rekawka when the SS
decided to close that section of the ghetto and relocate the hospital. They had lined the
staff up against the wall and dragged the patients downstairs. H had seen old Mrs.
Reisman's leg caught between the balusters, and an SS man hauling her (<font color='blue'><b>Reisman</b></font>) by the other leg
did not stop and extricate her (<font color='blue'><b>Reisman</b></font>) but pulled until the trapped limb snapped with an audible
crack. That was how patients were moved in the ghetto. But last year no one had thought
of mercy-killing. Everyone had still hoped at that stage that things might improve.
Now, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and Dr. B made their decision, H didn't know if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the rigor to feed
the cyanide to the ill, or to watch someone else do it and maintain a professional
dispassion. It was absurdly like the argument, in one's youth, about whether you should
approach a girl you were infatuated with. And when you'd decided, it still counted for
nothing. The act still had to be faced.
Out there on the balcony he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard the first
noise. It began early and came from the eastern
end of the ghetto. The Raus, raus! of
megaphones, the customary lie about baggage which
some people still chose to believe. In the deserted
streets, and among the tenements in which no one
moved, you could hear all the way from the cobblestones
of Plac Zgody and up by the river in
Nadwi@slanska Street an indefinite
terror-sick murmur which made H himself tremble.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard the first volley, loud enough to wake the patients. And a sudden stridency
after the firing, a bull megaphone raging at some plangent feminine voice; and then the
wailing snapped off by a further burst of fire, and a different wailing succeeding, the
bereaved being hurried along by the SS bullhorns, by anxious OD men, and by neighbors,
unreasonable grief fading into the far corner of the ghetto where there was a gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
knew that it all might well have cut through even the precomatose state of the musician
with the failed kidneys.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) returned to the ward, he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) could see that they were watching him (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>)--even the
musician. He (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) could sense rather than see the way their bodies stiffened in their beds, and
the old man with the colostomy cried out with the muscular exertion. <div class="bookquote">``Doctor, doctor!''
 (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>someone said. <div class="bookquote">``Please!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr.</b></font>)</div>answered Dr. H, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant, I'm here and they're a long
way off yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at Dr. B, who narrowed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes as the noise of evictions broke
out again three blocks away. Dr. B nodded at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), walked to the small locked
pharmaceutical chest at the end of the ward, and came back with the bottle of
hydrocyanic acid. After a pause, H moved to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) colleague's side. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have stood
and left it to Dr. B. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guessed that the man had the strength to do it alone, without the
approval of colleagues. But it would be shameful, H thought, not to cast his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own vote, not
to take some of the burden. Dr. H, though younger than Dr. B, had been associated with
the Jagiellonian University, was a specialist, a thinker. He (<font color='blue'><b>thinker</b></font>) wanted to give Dr. B the
backing of all that.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr.</b></font>)</div>said Dr. B, displaying the
bottle briefly to H. The word was
nearly obscured by a woman's screaming and
ranting official orders from the far end of
J@ozefi@nska Street. Dr. B called the
nurse. <div class="bookquote">``Give each patient forty drops in
water.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Forty drops,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) repeated. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
knew what the medication was. <div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr.</b></font>)</div>said Dr. B. Dr. H also looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).
Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>thinker</b></font>) wanted to say. I'm strong now; I could give it myself. But if I did, it would alarm
them. Every patient knows that nurses bring the medicine around.
As the nurse prepared the mixture, H wandered down the ward and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) hand on the
old man's. <div class="bookquote">``I have something to help you, Roman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>). Dr. H sensed with
amazement the old man's history through the touch of skin. For a second, like a surge of
flame, the young man Roman was there, growing up in Franz Josef's Galicia, a ladykiller
in the sweet little nougat of a city, the petit Wien, the jewel of the Vistula, Cracow.
Wearing Franz Josef's uniform and going to the mountains for spring maneuvers.
Chocolate-soldiering in Rynek Glowny with the girls of Kazimierz, in a city of lace and
patisseries. Climbing the Kosciuszko Mound and stealing a kiss among the shrubbery.
How could the world have come so far in one manhood? asked the young man in old
Roman. From Franz Josef to the NCO who had had a sanction to put Rosalia Blau and
the scarlet fever girls to death?
<div class="bookquote">``Please, Roman,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, meaning that the old man should unclench his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
believed the Sonderkommando was coming within the hour. Dr. H felt, but resisted, a
temptation to let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in on the secret. Dr. B had been liberal with the dosage. A few
seconds of breathlessness and a minor amazement would be no new or intolerable
sensation to old Roman. When the nurse came with four medicine glasses, none of them
even asked her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was bringing them. Dr. H would never know if any of them
understood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) turned away and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) watch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) feared that when they drank it,
some noise would begin, something worse than the normal hospital gasps and gaggings.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) heard the nurse murmuring, <div class="bookquote">``Here's something for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>nurse</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) heard an intake of
breath. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) didn't know if it was patient or nurse. The woman is the hero of this, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)
thought.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) looked again, the nurse was waking the kidney patient, the sleepy musician, and
offering him (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) the glass. From the far end of the ward, Dr. B looked on in a clean white
coat.
Dr. H moved to old Roman and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) pulse. There was none. In a bed at the far end of
the ward, the musician forced the almond-smelling mixture down.
It was all as gentle as H had hoped. He (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) looked at them--their mouths agape, but not
obscenely so, their eyes glazed and immune, their heads back, their chins pointed at the
ceiling--with the envy any ghetto dweller would feel for escapees.

<p/>CHAPTER 21
Poldek Pfefferberg shared a room on the second floor of a nineteenth-century house at the
end of J@ozefi@nska Street. Its windows looked down over the ghetto wall at the
Vistula, where Polish barges passed upstream and down in ignorance of the ghetto's last
day and SS patrol boats puttered as casually as pleasure craft. Here Pfefferberg waited
with his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) wife, Mila, for the Sonderkommando to arrive and order them out into the street.
Mila was a small, nervous girl of twenty-two, a refugee from @l@od@z whom Poldek
had married in the first days of the ghetto. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) came from generations of physicians, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>)
father having been a surgeon who had died young in 1937, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) mother a dermatologist
who, during an Aktion in the ghetto of Tarnow last year, had suffered the same death as
Rosalia Blau of the epidemic hospital, being cut down by automatic fire while standing
among her (<font color='blue'><b>Blau</b></font>) patients.
Mila had lived a sweet childhood, even in Jew-baiting @l@od@z, and had begun her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>)
own medical education in Vienna the year before the war. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) had met Poldek when
@l@od@z people were shipped down to Cracow in 1939. Mila had found herself billeted
in the same apartment as the lively Poldek Pfefferberg.
Now he (<font color='blue'><b>dermatologist</b></font>) was already, like Mila, the last of his (<font color='blue'><b>dermatologist</b></font>) family. His (<font color='blue'><b>dermatologist</b></font>) mother, who had once
redecorated Schindler's Straszewskiego Street apartment, had been shipped with his (<font color='blue'><b>dermatologist</b></font>)
father to the ghetto of Tarnow. From there, it would be discovered in the end, they were
taken to Bel@zec and murdered. His (<font color='blue'><b>dermatologist</b></font>) sister and brother-in-law, on Aryan papers, had
vanished in the Pawiak prison in Warsaw. He (<font color='blue'><b>dermatologist</b></font>) and Mila had only each other. There was a
temperamental gulf between them: Poldek was a neighborhood boy, a leader, an
organizer; the type who, when authority appeared and asked what in God's name was
happening, would step forward and speak up. Mila was quieter, rendered more so by the
unspeakable destiny that had swallowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) family. In a peaceable era, the mix between
them would have been excellent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) was not only clever but wise; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) was a quiet
center. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) had a gift for irony, and Poldek Pfefferberg often needed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) to restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
torrents of oratory. Today, however, on this impossible day, they were in conflict.
Though Mila was willing, should the chance come, to leave the ghetto, even to entertain a
mental image of herself and Poldek as partisans in the forest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) feared the sewers.
Poldek had used them more than once as a means of leaving the ghetto, even though the
police were sometimes to be found at one end or the other. His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) friend and former lecturer,
Dr.
H, had also mentioned the sewers recently as an
escape route which might not be guarded on the day the
Sonderkommando moved in. The thing would be
to wait for the early winter dusk. The door of the
doctor's house was mere meters from a manhole
cover. Once down in there, you took the left-hand
tunnel, which brought you beneath the streets of
nonghetto Podg@orze to an outlet on the
embankment of the Vistula near the Zatorska
Street canal. Yesterday Dr. H had given
him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) the definite news. The doctor and his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wife
would attempt the sewer exit, and the Pfefferbergs
were welcome to join them. Poldek could not at that
stage commit Mila and himself. Mila had a fear,
a reasonable one, that the SS might flood the
sewers with gas or might resolve the matter
anyhow by arriving early at the Pfefferbergs'
room at the far end of J@ozefi@nska
Street.
It was a slow, tense day up in the attic
room, waiting to find out which way to jump. Neighbors must also have been waiting.
Perhaps some of them, not wanting to deal with the delay, had marched up the road
already with their packages and hopeful suitcases, for in a way it was a mix of sounds fit
to draw you down the stairs--violent noise dimly heard from blocks away, and here a
silence in which you could hear the ancient, indifferent timbers of the house ticking away
the last and worst hours of your tenancy. At murky noon Poldek and Mila chewed on
their brown bread, the 300g each they had in stock. The recurrent noises of the Aktion
swept up to the corner of Wegierska, a long block away, and then, toward midafternoon,
receded again. There was near-silence then. Someone tried uselessly to flush the
recalcitrant toilet on the first-floor landing. It was nearly possible at that hour to believe
that they had been overlooked.
The last dun afternoon of their life in No. 2 J@ozefi@nska refused, in spite of its
darkness, to end. The light, in fact, was poor enough, thought Poldek, for them to try for
the sewer earlier than dusk. He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) wanted, now that it was quiet, to go and consult with Dr.
H.
Please, said Mila. But he (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) would keep off the streets, moving through the network of holes that connected one
building with another. He (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) piled up the reassurances. The streets at this end seemed to be
clear of patrols. He (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) would evade the occasional OD or wandering SS man at the
intersections, and be back within five minutes. Darling, darling, he (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>), I have to
check with Dr. H.
He (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) went down the back stairs and into the yard
through the hole in the stable wall, not emerging into the
open street until he (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>)'d reached the Labor
Office. There he (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) risked crossing the broad
carriageway, entering the warrens of the triangular
block of houses opposite, meeting occasional
groups of confused men conveying rumors and discussing
options in kitchens, sheds, yards, and
corridors. He (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) came out into Krakusa
Street just across from the doctor's place. He (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) crossed unnoticed by a patrol working
down near the southern limit of the ghetto, three blocks away, in the area where Schindler
had witnessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) first demonstration of the extremities of Reich racial policy.
Dr. H's building was empty, but in the yard Poldek met a dazed middle-aged man who
told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the Sonderkommando had already visited the place and that the doctor and
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wife had first hidden, then gone for the sewers. Perhaps it's the right thing to do, said
the man. They'll be back, the SS. Poldek nodded; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew now the tactics of the Aktion,
having already survived so many.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went back the way he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d come and again was able to cross the road. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found No.
2 empty, Mila vanished with their baggage, all doors opened, all rooms vacant. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wondered if in fact they were not all hidden down at the hospital--Dr. H and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife;
Mila. Perhaps the H's had called for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) out of respect for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) anxiety and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) long
medical lineage.
Poldek hurried out through the stable again, and by alternative passageways reached the
hospital courtyard. Like disregarded flags of surrender, bloodied bedding hung from the
balconies of both the upper floors. On the cobblestones was a pile of victims. They lay,
some of them, with their heads split open, their limbs twisted. They were not, of course,
the terminal patients of Doctors B and H. They were people who had been detained here
during the day and then executed. Some of them must have been imprisoned upstairs,
shot, then tumbled into the yard. Always thereafter, when questioned about the corpses
in the ghetto hospital yard, Poldek would say 60 to 70, though he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had no time to count
that tangled pyramid. Cracow being a provincial town and Poldek having been raised as a
very sociable child in Podg@orze and then in the Centrum, visiting with his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) mother the
affluent and distinguished people of the city, he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) recognized in that heap familiar faces:
old clients of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) mother's; people who had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) about school at the Kosciuszko
High School, got precocious answers in reply, and fed him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) cake and candy for his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) looks
and charm. Now they were shamefully exposed and jumbled in that blood-red courtyard.
Somehow it did not occur to Pfefferberg to look for the bodies of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) wife and the H's.
He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) sensed why he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had been placed there. He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) believed unshakably in better years to come,
years of just tribunals. He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had that sense of being a witness which Schindler had
experienced on the hill beyond Rekawka.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was distracted by the sight of a crowd of people in Wegierska Street beyond the
courtyard. They moved toward the Rekawka gate with the dull but not desperate languor
of factory workers on a Monday morning, or even of supporters of a defeated football
team. Among this wave of people he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) noticed neighbors from J@ozefi@nska Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
walked out of the yard, carrying like a weapon up his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) sleeve his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) memory of it all. What
had happened to Mila? Did any of them know? She (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>)'d already left, they said. The
Sonderkommando's been through. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>)'d already be out the gate, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) way to the place.
To P@lasz@ow.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) and Mila, of course, had had a contingency plan for an impasse like this. If one of
them ended up in P@lasz@ow, it would be better for the other to attempt to stay out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
knew that Mila had her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) gift for unobtrusiveness, a good gift for prisoners; but also she (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>)
could be racked by extraordinary hunger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d be her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) supplier from the outside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was
sure these things could be managed. It was no easy decision, though--the bemused
crowds, barely guarded by the SS, now making for the south gate and the barbed-wire
factories of P@lasz@ow were an indication of where most people, probably quite
correctly, considered that long-term safety lay.
The light, though late now, was sharp, as if snow were coming on. Poldek was able to
cross the road and enter the empty apartments beyond the pavement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) wondered
whether they were in fact empty or full of ghetto dwellers concealed cunningly or
naively--those who believed that wherever the SS took you, it led in the end to the
extermination chambers.
Poldek was looking for a first-class hiding place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) came by back passages to the
lumberyard on J@ozefi@nska. Lumber was a scarce commodity. There were no great
structures of cut timber to hide behind. The place that looked best was behind the iron
gates at the yard entrance. Their size and blackness seemed a promise of the coming
night. Later he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) would not be able to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d chosen them with such enthusiasm.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) hunched in behind the one that was pushed back against the wall of the abandoned
office. Through the crack left between the gate and the gatepost, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) could see up
J@ozefi@nska in the direction he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d come from. Behind that freezing iron leaf he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
watched the slice of cold evening, a luminous gray, and pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) coat across his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) chest.
A man and his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) wife hurried past, rushing for the gate, dodging among the dropped
bundles, the suitcases labeled with futile large letters. KLEINFELD, they proclaimed in
the evening light. LEHRER, BAUME, WEINBERG, SMOLAR, STRUS, ROSENTHAL,
BIRMAN, ZEITLIN.
Names against which no receipts would be issued. <div class="bookquote">``Heaps of goods laden with
memories,''  (<font color='red'><b>artist</b></font>)</div>the young artist Josef Bau had written of such scenes. <div class="bookquote">``Where are my
treasures?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>From beyond this battleground of fallen luggage he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) could hear the aggressive baying of
dogs. Then into J@ozefi@nska Street, striding on the far pavement, came three SS men,
one of them dragged along by a canine flurry which proved to be two large police dogs.
The dogs hauled their handler into No. 41 J@ozefi@nska, but the other two men waited
on the pavement. Poldek had paid most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) attention to the dogs. They looked like a
cross between Dalmatians and German shepherds. Pfefferberg still saw Cracow as a
genial city, and dogs like that looked foreign, as if they'd been brought in from some
other and harsher ghetto. For even in this last hour, among the litter of packages, behind
an iron gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) was grateful for the city and presumed that the ultimate frightfulness was
always performed in some other, less gracious place. This last assumption was wiped
away in the next half-minute. The worst thing, that is, occurred in Cracow. Through the
crack of the gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) saw the event which revealed that if there was a pole of evil it was
not situated in Tarnow, Czestochowa, Lw@ow or Warsaw, as you thought. It was at the
north side of J@ozefi@nska Street a hundred and twenty paces away. From 41 came a
screaming woman and a child. One dog had the woman by the cloth of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress, the
flesh of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hip. The SS man who was the servant of the dogs took the child and flung it
against the wall. The sound of it made Pfefferberg close his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard the shot
which put an end to the woman's howling protest.
Just as Pfefferberg would think of the pile of bodies in the hospital yard as 60 or 70, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would always testify that the child was two or three years of age.
Perhaps before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was even dead, certainly before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself even knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had moved,
as if the decision had came from some mettlesome gland behind his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead, Pfefferberg
gave up the freezing iron gate, since it would not protect him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from the dogs, and found
himself in the open yard. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) adopted at once the military bearing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d learned in the
Polish Army. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) emerged from the lumberyard like a man on a ceremonial assignment,
and bent and began lifting the bundles of luggage out of the carriageway and heaping
them against the walls of the yard. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hear the three SS men approaching; the
dogs' snarling breath was palpable, and the whole evening was stretched to breaking by
the tension in their leashes. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed they were some ten paces off, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
straightened and permitted himself, playing the biddable Jew of some European
background, to notice them. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw that their boots and riding breeches were splashed
with blood, but they were not abashed to appear before other humans dressed that way.
The officer in the middle was tallest. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) did not look like a murderer; there was a
sensitivity to the large face and a subtle line to the mouth.
Pfefferberg in his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) shabby suit clicked his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) cardboard heels in the Polish style and saluted
this tall one in the middle. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had no knowledge of SS ranks and did not know what to
call the man. <div class="bookquote">``Herr,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Herr Commandant!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was a term his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain, under threat of its extinction, had thrown forth with electric
energy. It proved to be the precise word, for the tall man was Amon Goeth in the full
vitality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) afternoon, elated at the day's progress and as capable of instant and
instinctive exercises of power as Poldek Pfefferberg was of instant and instinctive
subterfuge.
<div class="bookquote">``Herr Commandant, I respectfully report to you that I received an order to put all the
bundles together to one side of the road so that there will be no obstruction of the
thoroughfare.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The dogs were craning toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) through their collars. They expected, on the basis of
their black training and the rhythm of today's Aktion, to be let fly at Pfefferberg's wrist
and groin. Their snarls were not simply feral, but full of a frightful confidence in the
outcome, and the question was whether the SS man on the Herr Commandant's left had
enough strength to restrain them. Pfefferberg didn't expect much. He (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) would not be
surprised to be buried by dogs and after a time to be delivered from their ravages by a
bullet. If the woman hadn't got away with pleading her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) motherhood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) stood little
chance with stories of bundles, of clearing a street in which human traffic had in any case
been abolished.
But the Commandant was more amused by Pfefferberg than he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) had been by the mother.
Here was a Ghettomensch playing soldier in front of three SS officers and making his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
report, servile if true, and almost endearing if not. His (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) manner was, above all, a break in
style for a victim. Of all today's doomed, not one other had tried heel-clicking. The Herr
Commandant could therefore exercise the kingly right to show irrational and unexpected
amusement. His (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) head went back; his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) long upper lip retracted. It was a broad, honest
laugh, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) colleagues smiled and shook their heads at its extent.
In his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) excellent baritone,
Untersturmf@uhrer Goeth said, <div class="bookquote">``We're
looking after everything. The last group is leaving the ghetto. Verschwinde!''  (<font color='red'><b>baritone</b></font>)</div>That is,
Disappear, little Polish clicking soldier!
Pfefferberg began to run, not looking back, and it would not have surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) had
been felled from behind. Running, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) got to the corner of Wegierska and turned it, past
the hospital yard where some hours ago he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) had been a witness. The dark came down as
he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) neared the gate, and the ghetto's last familiar alleys faded. In Podg@orze Square, the
last official huddle of prisoners stood in a loose cordon of SS men and Ukrainians.
<div class="bookquote">``I must be the last one out alive,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) told people in that crowd.
Or if not he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) it was Wulkan the jeweler and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>)
wife and son. Wulkan had been working these past
months in the Progress factory and, knowing what
was to happen, had approached Treuh@ander
Unkelbach with a large diamond concealed for two
years in the lining of a coat. <div class="bookquote">``Herr
Unkelbach,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) told the supervisor,
<div class="bookquote">``I'll go wherever I'm sent, but my wife
isn't up to all that noise and violence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the supervisor</b></font>)</div>Wulkan and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) wife and son would wait at the OD police station under the protection of
a Jewish policeman they knew, and then perhaps during the day Herr Unkelbach would
come and convey them bloodlessly to P@lasz@ow.
Since this morning they had sat in a cubicle in the police station, but it had been as
frightful a wait as if they'd stayed in their kitchen, the boy alternately terrified and bored,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wife continuing to hiss her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reproaches. Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) going to come at all?
These people, these people! Early in the afternoon, Unkelbach did in fact appear, came
into the Ordnungsdienst to use the lavatory and have coffee. Wulkan, emerging from the
office in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>)'d been waiting, saw a Treuh@ander Unkelbach he (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) had never known
before: a man in the uniform of an SS NCO, smoking and exchanging animated
conversation with another SS man; using one hand to take hungry mouthfuls of coffee, to
bite off mouthfuls of smoke, to savage a lump of brown bread while his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pistol, still held
in the left hand, lay like a resting animal on the police-station counter and dark spatters of
blood ran across the breast of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uniform. The eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned to meet Wulkan's did not
see the jeweler. Wulkan knew at once that Unkelbach was not backing out of the deal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Unkelbach</b></font>)
simply did not remember it. The man was drunk, and not on liquor. If Wulkan had called
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>), the answer would have been a stare of ecstatic incomprehension. Followed, very
likely, by something worse.
Wulkan gave it up and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) kept saying, <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Unkelbach</b></font>)?
I'll talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Unkelbach</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Unkelbach</b></font>)'s still there.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>But then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw the shadow in Wulkan's eyes and
sneaked a look around the edge of the door. Unkelbach was getting ready to leave. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
saw the unaccustomed uniform, the blood of small traders and their wives splashed across
its front. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) uttered a whimper and returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seat. Like her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) now fell
into a well-founded despair, and the waiting became somehow easier. The OD man they
knew restored them to the usual pulse of hope and anxiety. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told them that all the OD,
apart from Spira's praetorians, had to be out of the ghetto by 6 P.m. and on the Wieliczka
Road to P@lasz@ow. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would see if there was a way of getting the Wulkans into one of
the vehicles. After dark had fallen in the wake of Pfefferberg's passage up Wegierska,
after the last party of prisoners had assembled at the gate into Podg@orze Square, while
Dr.
H and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife were moving eastward in the company and under the cover of a group of
rowdy Polish drunks, and while the squads of the Sonderkommando were resting and
taking a smoke before the last search of the tenements, two horse-drawn wagons came to
the door of the police station. The Wulkan family were hidden by the OD men under
cartons of paperwork and bundles of clothing. Symche Spira and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) associates were not
in sight, were on the job somewhere in the streets, drinking coffee with NCO'S,
celebrating their permanence within the system.
But before the wagons had turned out of the ghetto gate, the Wulkans, flattened to the
boards, heard the nearly continuous sound of rifle and small-arms fire from the streets
behind them. It meant that Amon Goeth and Willi Haase, Albert Hujar, Horst Pilarzik,
and some hundreds of others were bursting into the attic niches, the false ceilings, the
crates in cellars, and finding those who all day had maintained a hopeful silence.
More than 4,000 such people were discovered overnight and executed in the streets. In
the next two days their bodies were taken to P@lasz@ow on open-platform trucks and
buried in two mass graves in the woods beyond the new camp.

<p/>CHAPTER 22
We do not know in what condition of soul Oskar Schindler spent March 13, the ghetto's
last and worst day. But by the time his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) workers returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) under guard from
P@lasz@ow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was back in the mood for collecting data to pass on to Dr.
Sedlacek on the dentist's next visit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>)
found out from the prisoners that
Zwangsarbeitslager P@lasz@ow--as it was known in SS bureaucratese--was to be no
rational kingdom. Goeth had already pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) passion against engineers by letting the
guards beat Zygmunt Gr@unberg into a coma and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) so late to the clinic up near
the women's camp that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sedlacek</b></font>) death was assured. From the prisoners who ate their hearty
noonday soup at DEF, Oskar heard also that P@lasz@ow was being used not only as a
work camp but as a place of execution as well. Though all the camp could hear the
executions, some of the prisoners had been witnesses.
The prisoner M, for example, who had had a prewar decorating business in Cracow.
In the first days of the camp he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was in demand
to decorate the houses of the SS, the few small
country villas that flanked the lane on the north
side of the camp. Like any especially valued
artisan he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had more freedom of movement, and one
afternoon that spring he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had been walking from the villa of
Untersturmf@uhrer Leo John up the
track toward the hill called Chujowa
G@orka, on whose crest stood the Austrian fort. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was ready to turn back down
the slope to the factory yard, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had to pause to let an Army truck grind past him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) uphill.
M had noticed that beneath its canopy were women under the care of white-coveralled
Ukrainian guards. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had hidden between stacks of lumber and got an incomplete view
of the women, disembarked and marched inside the fort, refusing to undress. The man
yelling the orders in there was the SS man Edmund Sdrojewski. Ukrainian NCO'S
marched among the women hitting them with whip handles. M presumed they were
Jewish, probably women caught with Aryan papers, brought here from Montelupich
prison. Some cried out at the blows, but others were silent, as if to refuse the Ukrainians
that much satisfaction. One of them began to intone the Shema Yisroel, and the others
took it up. The verses rose vigorously above the mound, as if it had just occurred to the
girls--who till yesterday had played straight Aryans--that now the pressure was off, they
were freer than anyone to celebrate their tribal difference in the faces of Sdrojewski and
the Ukrainians. Then, huddling for modesty and the bite of the spring air, they were all
shot. At night the Ukrainians took them away in wheelbarrows and buried them in the
woods on the far side of Chujowa G@orka.
Now living in Vienna, the man does
not want his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) real name used.
People in the camp below had also heard that first execution on the hill now profanely
nicknamed <div class="bookquote">``Prick Hill.''  (<font color='red'><b>People</b></font>)</div>Some told themselves that it was partisans being shot up there,
intractable Marxists or crazy nationalists. It was another country up there. If you obeyed
the ordinances within the wire, you need never visit it. But the more clearheaded of
Schindler's workers, marched up Wieliczka Street past the cable factory and over to
Zablocie to work at DEF--THEY knew why prisoners from Montelupich were being
shot at the Austrian hill fort, why the SS did not seem alarmed if the truckloads were seen
arriving or the noise was heard throughout P@lasz@ow. The reason was that the SS did
not look on the prison population as ultimate witnesses. If there had been concern about a
time in court, a mass of future testimony, they would have taken the women deeper into
the woods. The conclusion to be drawn, Oskar decided, was not that Chujowa G@orka
was a separate world from P@lasz@ow, but that all of them, those brought to the mound
fort by truck and those behind the wire down the hill, were under sentence. The first
morning Commandant Goeth stepped out his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) front door and murdered a prisoner at
random, there was a tendency to see this also, like the first execution on Chujowa
G@orka, as a unique event, discrete from what would become the customary life of the
camp. In fact, of course, the killings on the hill would soon prove to be habitual, and so
would Amon's morning routine. Wearing a shirt and riding breeches and boots on which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) orderly had put a high shine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would emerge on the steps of his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) temporary villa.
-LRB-they were renovating a better place for him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) down at the other end of the camp
perimeter.-RRB- As the season wore on he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would appear without his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) shirt, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) loved the sun.
But for the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) stood in the clothes in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had eaten breakfast, a pair of
binoculars in one hand and a sniper's rifle in the other. He (<font color='blue'><b>sniper</b></font>) would scan the camp area, the
work at the quarry, the prisoners pushing or hauling the quarry trucks on the rails which
passed by his (<font color='blue'><b>sniper</b></font>) door. Those glancing up could see the smoke from the cigarette which he (<font color='blue'><b>sniper</b></font>)
held clamped between his (<font color='blue'><b>sniper</b></font>) lips, the way a man smokes without hands when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is too busy
to put down the tools of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trade. Within the first few days of the camp's life he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared
thus at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) front door and shot a prisoner who did not seem to be pushing hard enough at
a cart loaded with limestone. No one knew Amon's precise reason for settling on that
prisoner--
Amon certainly did not have to document his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) motives. With one blast from the doorstep,
the man was plucked from the group of pushing and pulling captives and hurled sideways
in the road. The others stopped pushing, of course, their muscles frozen in expectation of
a general slaughter. But Amon waved them on, frowning, as if to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was pleased
for the moment with the standard of work he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was getting from them.
Apart from such excesses with prisoners, Amon was also breaking one of the promises
he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)'d made to the entrepreneurs. Oskar got a telephone call from Madritsch--Madritsch
wanted them both to complain. Amon had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would not interfere in the business of
the factories. At least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was not interfering from within. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) held up shifts by
detaining the prison population for hours on the Appellplatz -LRB-parade ground-RRB- at roll call.
Madritsch mentioned a case in which a potato had been found in a given hut, and
therefore every prisoner from that barracks had to be publicly flogged in front of the
thousands of inmates. It is no fast matter to have a few hundred people drag their pants
and underwear down, their shirts or dresses up, and treat each of them to twenty-five
lashes. It was Goeth's rule that the flogged prisoner call out the numbers for the guidance
of the Ukrainian orderlies who did the flogging. If the victim lost track of the count, it
was to begin again. Commandant Goeth's roll calls on the Appellplatz were full of just
such time-consuming trickery.
Therefore shifts would arrive hours late at the Madritsch clothing factory inside the
P@lasz@ow camp, and an hour later still at Oskar's place in Lipowa Street. They would
arrive shocked, too, unable to concentrate, muttering stories of what Amon or John or
Scheidt or some other officer had done that morning. Oskar complained to an engineer he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
knew at the Armaments Inspectorate. It's no use complaining to the police chiefs, said the
engineer. They're not involved in the same war we are. What I ought to do, said Oskar,
is keep the people on the premises. Make my own camp.
The idea amused the engineer. Where would you put them, old man? he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked. You don't
have much room.
If I can acquire the space, said Oskar,
would you write a supporting letter?
When the engineer agreed, Oskar called an elderly couple named Bielski who lived in
Stradom Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wondered if they would consider an offer for the land abutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
factory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) drove across the river to see them. They were delighted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) manner.
Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had always been bored by the rituals of haggling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) began by offering them a
boom-time price. They gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) tea and, in a state of high excitement, called their lawyer
to draw up the papers while Oskar was still on the premises. From their apartment, Oskar
drove out, as a courtesy, and told Amon that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) intended to make a subcamp of
P@lasz@ow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) own factory yard. Amon was quite taken with the idea. <div class="bookquote">``If the SS
generals approve,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you can expect my cooperation. As long as you don't want
my musicians or my maid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The next day a full-scale appointment was arranged with Oberf@uhrer Scherner at
Pomorska Street. Somehow both Amon and General Scherner knew that Oskar could be
made to foot the whole bill for a new camp. They could detect that when Oskar pushed
the industrial argument--<div class="bookquote">``I want my workers on the premises so that their labor can be
more fully exploited'' (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was at the same time pushing some other intimate craze of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
in which expense was no question. They thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) as a good enough fellow who'd
been stricken with a form of Jew-love as with a virus. It was a corollary to SS theory that
the Jewish genius so pervaded the world, could achieve such magical effects, that Herr
Oskar Schindler was to be pitied as much as was a prince turned into a frog. But he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>)
would have to pay for his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) disease.
The requirements of Obergruppenf@uhrer
Friedrich-Wilhelm Kr@uger, police chief
of the Government General and superior of Scherner
and Czurda, were based on the regulations set
down by the Concentration Camp Section of General
Oswald Pohl's SS Main
Administrative and Economic Office, even
though as yet P@lasz@ow was run independently
of Pohl's bureau. The basic stipulations for
an SS Forced Labor Subcamp involved the
erection of fences nine feet tall, of
watchtowers at given intervals according to the length of the
camp perimeter, of latrines, barracks, a
clinic, a dental office, a bathhouse and
delousing complex, a barbershop, a food store, a laundry, a barracks office, a guard block
of somewhat better construction than the barracks themselves, and all the accessories.
What had occurred to Amon, Scherner, and Czurda was that Oskar, as was only proper,
would meet the expenses either out of economic motives or because of the cabalistic
enchantment he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) lay under. And even though they would make Oskar pay, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) proposal
suited them. There was still a ghetto in Tarnow, forty-five miles east, and when it was
abolished the population would need to be absorbed into P@lasz@ow. Likewise the
thousands of Jews now arriving at P@lasz@ow from the shtetls of southern Poland. A
subcamp in Lipowa Street would ease that pressure.
Amon also understood, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would never say it aloud to the police chiefs, that there
would be no need to supply a Lipowa Street camp too precisely with the minimum food
requirements as laid down in General Pohl's directive. Amon--who could hurl
thunderbolts from his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) doorstep without meeting protest, who believed in any case in the
official idea that a certain attrition should take place in P@lasz@ow--was already selling
a percentage of the prison rations on the open market in Cracow through an agent of his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>),
a Jew named Wilek Chilowicz, who had contacts with factory managements, merchants,
and even restaurants in Cracow.
Dr. Alexander Biberstein, now a
P@lasz@ow prisoner himself, found that the daily ration varied between 700 and 1,100
calories. At breakfast a prisoner received a half-liter of black ersatz coffee, tasting of
acorns, and a lump of rye bread weighing 175g, an eighth of one of the round loaves
collected by barracks mess orderlies each morning at the bakery. Hunger being such a
disruptive force, each mess orderly cut up the loaf with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) back to the others and called,
<div class="bookquote">``Who wants this piece? Who wants this one?''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>At midday a soup was distributed--
carrots, beets, sago substitute. Some days it had a fuller body than on others. Better food
came in with the work parties who returned each evening. A small chicken could be
carried under a coat, a French roll down a trouser leg. Yet Amon tried to prevent this by
having the guards search returning details at dusk in front of the Administration Building.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) did not want the work of natural wastage to be frustrated, nor the ideological wind to
be taken out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) food dealings through Chilowicz. Since, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) did not indulge
his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) own prisoners, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) felt that if Oskar chose to take a thousand Jews, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could indulge
them at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) own expense, without too regular a supply of bread and beets from the
storerooms of P@lasz@ow.
That spring, it was not only the police chiefs
of the Cracow region whom Oskar had to talk
to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) backyard, persuading the
neighbors. Beyond the two shabby huts constructed
of Jereth's pineboard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) came to the radiator
factory run by Kurt Hoderman. It
employed a horde of Poles and about
100 P@lasz@ow inmates. In the other
direction was Jereth's box factory,
supervised by the German engineer Kuhnpast. Since the P@lasz@ow people were such a
small part of their staff, they didn't take to the idea with any passion, but they weren't
against it. For Oskar was offering to house their Jews 50 meters from work instead of 5
kilometers.
Next Oskar moved out into the neighborhood
to talk to engineer Schmilewski at the
Wehrmacht garrison office a few streets
away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) employed a squad of P@lasz@ow prisoners. Schmilewski had no objections.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) name, with Kuhnpast's and Hoderman's, was appended to the application Schindler
sent off to Pomorska Street.
SS surveyors visited Emalia and conferred with surveyor Steinhauser, an old friend of
Oskar's from the Armaments Inspectorate. They stood and frowned at the site, as
surveyors will, and asked questions about drainage. Oskar had them all into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) office
upstairs for a morning coffee and a cognac, and then everyone parted amiably. Within a
few days the application to establish a Forced Labor Subcamp in the factory backyard
was accepted.
That year DEF would enjoy a profit of 15.8 million Reichsmarks. It might be thought that
the 300,000 RM. Oskar now spent on building materials for the Emalia camp was a large
but not fatal overhead. The truth was though that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was only beginning to pay.
Oskar sent a plea to the Bauleitung, or
Construction Office, of P@lasz@ow for the help
of a young engineer named Adam Garde. Garde was still
working on the barracks of Amon's camp and, after
leaving instructions for the barracks builders, would be
marched under individual guard from P@lasz@ow
to Lipowa Street to supervise the setting up of
Oskar's compound. When Garde first turned up in
Zablocie, he (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) found two rudimentary huts
already occupied by close to 400 prisoners. There
was a fence patrolled by an SS squad, but the
inmates told Garde that Oskar did not let the
SS into the encampment or onto the factory
floor, except, of course, when senior
inspectors came to look over the place.
Oskar, they said, kept the small SS
garrison of the Emalia factory well
liquored and happy with their lot. Garde could see that the Emalia prisoners themselves
were content between the shrinking fragile boards of their two huts, the men's and the
women's. Already they called themselves Schindlerjuden, using the term in a mood of
cautious self-congratulation, the way a man recovering from a heart attack might describe
himself as a lucky beggar.
They'd already dug some primitive latrines, which engineer Garde, much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) approved
the impulse behind the work, could smell from the factory entrance. They washed at a
pump in the DEF yard.
Oskar asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to come up to the office and look
at the plans. Six barracks for up to 1,200
people. The cookhouse at this end, the SS barracks
--Oskar was temporarily accommodating the SS in a part of the factory--beyond the wire
at the far end. I want a really first-rate shower block and laundry, Oskar told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). I have
the welders who can put it together under your direction. Typhus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) growled, halfsmiling
at Garde. None of us wants typhus. The lice are already biting in P@lasz@ow.
We need to be able to boil clothes.
Adam Garde was delighted to go to Lipowa Street each day. Two engineers had already
been punished at P@lasz@ow for their diplomas, but at DEF experts were still experts.
One morning, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) guard was marching him (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) up Wieliczka Street toward Zablocie, a
black limousine materialized, braking hard at their heels. From it emerged
Untersturmf@uhrer Goeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) had that restless look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>).
One prisoner, one guard, he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) observed.
What does it mean? The Ukrainian begged to inform the Herr Commandant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) had
orders to escort this prisoner each morning to Herr Oskar Schindler's Emalia. They both
hoped, Garde and the Ukrainian, that the mention of Oskar's name would give them
immunity. One guard, one prisoner? asked the Commandant again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) was appeased
and got back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) limousine without resolving the matter in any radical way.
Later in the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) approached Wilek
Chilowicz, who besides being his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) agent was also chief of the Jewish camp police--or
<div class="bookquote">``firemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the camp police</b></font>)</div>as they were called. Symche Spira, recently the Napoleon of the ghetto, still
lived there and spent each day supervising the searching out and the digging up of the
diamonds, gold, and cash hidden away and unrecorded by people who were now ashes on
the pine needles of Bel@zec. In P@lasz@ow, however, Spira had no power, the center of
prison power being Chilowicz. No one knew where Chilowicz' authority came from.
Perhaps Willi Kunde had mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) name to Amon; perhaps Amon had recognized
and liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) style. But all at once, here he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was chief of firemen in P@lasz@ow, handerout
of the caps and armbands of authority in that debased kingdom and, like Symche,
limited enough in imagination to equate his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) power with that of tsars.
Goeth approached Chilowicz and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had better send Adam Garde to Schindler
full-time and get it over with. We have engineers to burn, said Goeth with distaste. He (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>)
meant that engineering had been a soft option for Jews who weren't allowed into the
medical faculties of the Polish universities. First, though, said Amon, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) goes to
Emalia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) has to finish the work on my conservatory.
This news came to Adam Garde in his (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) barracks, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) place in the four-tiered bunks of
Hut 21. He (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) would be delivered to Zablocie at the end of a trial. He (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) would be building at
Goeth's back door, where, as Reiter and Gr@unberg might have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>), the rules were
unpredictable.
In the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) work for the Commandant, a large
beam was lifted to its place in the rooftree of
Amon's conservatory. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) worked, Adam
Garde could hear the Commandant's two dogs, named
Rolf and Ralf, names from a newspaper cartoon
--except that Amon had permitted them in the past week to rip the breast from a female
prisoner suspected of idling. Amon himself, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) half-completed technical education,
would return again and again to take a professional stance and watch the roof beams
lifted by pulley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) came to ask questions when the center beam was being slotted into
place. It was an immense length of heavy pine, and across it Goeth called his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) question.
Adam Garde could not catch the meaning and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) ear. Again Goeth asked
it, and worse than not hearing it, Garde could not understand it. <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand, Herr
Commandant,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) admitted. Amon grabbed the rising beam with both long-fingered
hands, dragged back the end of it, and swung it toward the engineer. Garde saw the
massive timber spinning toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) head and understood that it was a mortal instrument.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) right hand and the beam took it, shattering the knuckles and the metacarpals
and hurling him (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) to the ground. When Garde could see again through the fog of pain and
nausea, Amon had turned and walked away. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would come again tomorrow for
a satisfactory answer ....
Lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) be seen as deformed and unfit, engineer Garde avoided favoring his (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) shattered
hand on the way to the Krankenstube -LRB-infirmary-RRB-.
Carried normally, it weighed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) side, a bladder of torment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) let Dr. Hilfstein talk
him (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) into accepting a plaster cast. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) continued to supervise the construction of the
conservatory and each day marched to the Emalia works, hoping that the long sleeve of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) coat helped conceal the cast. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) was unsure about this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) hand free of
the thing. Let the hand mend crookedly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) wanted to ensure his (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) transfer to Schindler's
subcamp by presenting an unmaimed appearance. Within a week, carrying a shirt and
some books in a bundle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) was marched to Lipowa Street for good.

<p/>CHAPTER 23
Among prisoners who knew, there was already competition to get into Emalia. Prisoner
Dolek Horowitz, a purchasing officer inside the P@lasz@ow camp, knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) would
not be allowed to go to Schindler's place himself. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) had a wife and two children.
Richard, the younger of the children, woke up early these spring mornings as the earth
gave off its last winter humor in mist, got down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) mother's bunk in the women's
quarters, and ran down the hillside to the men's camp, his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) mind on the coarse morning
bread. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had to be with his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) father for morning roll call on the Appellplatz. His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) path took
him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) past Chilowicz' Jewish Police post and, even on foggy mornings, within sight of two
watchtowers. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was safe because he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was known. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was a Horowitz child. His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
father was considered invaluable by Herr Bosch, who in turn was a drinking companion
of the Commandant's. Richard's unself-conscious freedom of movement derived from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) father's expertise; he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) moved charmed under the eyes in the towers, finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
father's barracks and climbing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) cot and waking him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) with questions. Why is there
mist in the mornings and not in the afternoons? Will there be trucks? Will it take long on
the Appellplatz today? Will there be floggings?
Through Richard's morning questions, Dolek Horowitz had it borne in on him (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) that
P@lasz@ow was unfit even for privileged children. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) could contact
Schindler--Schindler came out here now and then and walked around the Administration
Building and the workshops, under the guise of doing business, to leave small gifts and
exchange news with old friends like Stern and Roman Ginter and Poldek Pfefferberg.
When Dolek did not seem to be able to make contact this way, it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Ginter</b></font>) that perhaps
Schindler could be approached through Bosch. Dolek believed they met a lot. Not out
here so much, but perhaps in offices in town and at parties. You could tell they were not
friends, but were bound together by dealings, by mutual favors.
It was not only, and perhaps not mainly, Richard whom Dolek wanted to get into
Schindler's compound. Richard could diffuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) terror in clouds of questions. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
ten-year-old daughter, Niusia, who no longer asked questions; who was just another thin
child past the age of frankness; who--from a window in the brushworks shop where she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
sewed the bristles into the wooden backs--saw the daily truckloads arriving at the
Austrian hill fort and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) terror insupportably, the way adults will, unable to climb
onto a parental chest and transfer the fear. To soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hunger in P@lasz@ow, Niusia
had taken to smoking onion leaves in newspaper wrappings. The solid rumors about
Emalia were that such precocious methods weren't necessary there. So Dolek appealed
to Bosch during one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) tours of the clothing warehouse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) presumed on Bosch's
earlier kindnesses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) said, to beg him (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) to talk to Herr Schindler. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) pleadings
and repeated the children's names again, so that Bosch, whose memory was eroded by
schnapps, might still remember. Herr Schindler is probably my best friend, said Bosch.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>)'d do anything for me.
Dolek expected little from the talk. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) wife, Regina, had no experience of making shells
or enamelware. Bosch himself never mentioned the request again. Yet within the week
they marched out on the next Emalia list, cleared by Commandant Goeth in return for a
little envelope of jewelry.
Niusia looked like a thin, reserved adult in the women's barracks at Emalia, and Richard
moved as he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had in P@lasz@ow, everyone knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) in the munitions section and the
enamel shops, the guards accepting his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) familiarity. Regina kept expecting Oskar to come
up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) in the enamel factory and say, <div class="bookquote">``So you're Dolek Horowitz' wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Then the
only question would be how to frame her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) thanks. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) never did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) was delighted to
find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) was not very visible at Lipowa Street, and neither was her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) daughter. They
understood that Oskar knew who they were, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) often chatted with Richard by name.
They knew, too, by the altered nature of Richard's questions, the extent of what they had
been given.
The Emalia camp had no resident commandant
to tyrannize the inmates. There were no permanent
guards. The garrison was changed every two days,
two truckloads of SS and Ukrainians coming
up to Zablocie from P@lasz@ow to take over the
security of the subcamp. The P@lasz@ow
soldiers liked their occasional duty at
Emalia. The Herr Direktor's
kitchens, more primitive even than
P@lasz@ow's, turned out better meals.
Since the Herr Direktor started raging and making phone calls to Oberf@uhrer Scherner
if any guard, instead of just patrolling the perimeter, entered the camp, the garrison kept
to their side of the fence. Duty in Zablocie was pleasurably dull.
Except for inspection by senior SS men, the prisoners who worked at DEF rarely got a
close view of their guards. One barbed-wire passageway took the inmates to their work in
the enamel plant; another ran to the door of the munitions section. Those Emalia Jews
who worked at the box factory, the radiator plant, the garrison office were marched to
work and back by Ukrainians--different Ukrainians every second day. No guard had the
time to develop a fatal grudge against a prisoner.
Therefore, though the SS may have set the limits to the life people led in Emalia, Oskar
set its tone. The tone was one of fragile permanence. There were no dogs. There were no
beatings. The soup and the bread were better and more plentiful than in P@lasz@ow--
about 2,000 calories a day, according to a doctor who worked in Emalia as a factory
hand. The shifts were long, often twelve hours, for Oskar was still a businessman with
war contracts to fill and a conventional desire for profit. It must be said, though, that no
shift was arduous and that many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) prisoners seem to have believed at the time that
their labor was making a contribution in measurable terms to their survival.
According to accounts Oskar presented after the war to the
Joint Distribution Committee, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) spent
1,800,000 z@loty -LRB-$360,000-RRB- on food
for the Emalia camp. Cosmetic entries could be found, written off to similar expenditure,
in the books of Farben and Krupp--though nowhere near as high a percentage of the
profit as in Oskar's accounts. The truth is, though, that no one collapsed and died of
overwork, beatings, or hunger in Emalia. Whereas at I. G.
Farben's Buna plant alone, 25,000 prisoners out of a work force of 35,000 would perish
at their labor.
Long afterward, Emalia people would call the Schindler camp a paradise. Since they
were by then widely scattered, it cannot have been a description they decided on after the
fact. The term must have had some currency while they were in Emalia. It was, of course,
only a relative paradise, a heaven by contrast with P@lasz@ow. What it inspired in its
people was a sense of almost surreal deliverance, something preposterous which they
didn't want to look at too closely for fear it would evaporate. New DEF hands knew of
Oskar only by report. They did not want to put themselves in the Herr Direktor's path or
risk speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>).
They needed time for recovery and for adjustment to Schindler's unorthodox prison
system. A girl named Lusia, for example. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband had recently been separated out
from the mass of prisoners on the Appellplatz at P@lasz@ow and shipped off with others
to Mauthausen. With what would turn out to be mere realism, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grieved like a widow.
Grieving, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d been marched to Emalia. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) worked at carrying dipped enamelware to
the furnaces. You were permitted to heat up water on the warm surfaces of machinery,
and the floor was warm. For her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), hot water was Emalia's first beneficence.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw Oskar at first only as a large shape moving down an aisle of metal presses or
traversing a catwalk. It was somehow not a threatening shape. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sensed that if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were
noticed, the nature of the place--the lack of beatings, the food, the absence of guards in
the camp--might somehow reverse itself. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wanted only unobtrusively to work her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
shift and return down the barbed-wire tunnel to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hut in the compound.
After a while she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) found herself giving an answering nod to Oskar and even telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
that, yes, thank you, Herr Direktor, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was quite well.
Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) some cigarettes, better than gold both as a comfort and as a means of
trading with the Polish workers. Since she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew friends vanished, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feared his (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>)
friendship; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) to continue to be a presence, a magical parent. A paradise run
by a friend was too fragile. To manage an enduring heaven, you needed someone both
more authoritative and more mysterious than that.
Many of the Emalia prisoners felt the same. There was a girl named Regina Perlman
living, at the time Oskar's factory subcamp came into existence, in the city of Cracow on
forged South American papers. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>) dark complexion made the papers credible, and under
them she (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>) worked as an Aryan in the office of a factory in Podg@orze. She (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>) would have
been safer from blackmailers if she (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>)'d gone to Warsaw, @l@od@z, or Gdansk. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>)
parents were in P@lasz@ow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>) carried forged papers for their sakes too, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>)
could supply them with food, comforts, medicine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>) knew from the days in the ghetto
that it was an adage in the Jewish mythology of Cracow that Herr Schindler could be
expected to take extreme pains. She (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>) also knew the reports from P@lasz@ow, from the
quarry, the Commandant's balcony. She (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>) would have to break cover to do it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>)
believed it essential that she (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>) get her (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>) parents into Schindler's backyard camp.
The first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>) visited DEF she (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>) wore a safely anonymous faded floral dress and no
stockings. The Polish gateman went through the business of calling Herr Schindler's
office upstairs, and through the glass she (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>) could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) disapproving of her (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>). It's
nobody--some grubby girl from one of the other factories. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had the normal fear of
people on Aryan papers that a hostile Pole would somehow spot her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) Jewishness. This
one looked hostile.
It's of no great importance, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) returned shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wanted
to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) off her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) track. But the Pole did not even bother to lie to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) won't see
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) said. The hood of a BMW glowered in the factory yard, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could see, and it
could belong only to Herr Schindler. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was in, but not to visitors who couldn't afford
stockings. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went away trembling at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) escape. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d been saved from making to Herr
Schindler a confession which, even in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feared making to anyone.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) waited a week before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could get more time off from the factory in Podg@orze.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) devoted an entire half-day to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) approach. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bathed and got black-market
stockings. From one of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) few friends--a girl on Aryan papers could not risk having
many--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) borrowed a blouse.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had an excellent jacket of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own and
bought a lacquered straw hat with a veil. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
made up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face, achieving a dark radiance
appropriate to a woman living beyond threat. In
the mirror she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked like her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) prewar
self, an elegant Cracovienne of exotic
racial derivation--Hungarian businessman father, perhaps, and a mother from Rio.
This time, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had intended, the Pole in the
gatehouse did not even recognize her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) inside while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rang Miss
Klonowska, the Herr Direktor's
secretary, and then was put on to speak to Schindler himself. Herr Direktor, said the Pole,
there is a lady here to see you on important business. Herr Schindler seemed to want
details. A very well-dressed young lady, said the Pole, and then, bowing while holding
the telephone, a very beautiful young lady, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) said. As if he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had a hunger to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), or
perhaps as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might be some forgotten girl who'd embarrass him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) in the outer office,
Schindler met her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on the steps. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) smiled when he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) did not know her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was very
pleased to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), this Fraulein Rodriguez. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) had a respect for
pretty women, that it was at the same time childlike and yet sophisticated. With flourishes
like those of a matinee idol, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) indicated she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) upstairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wanted to
talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) in confidence? Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) past Klonowska. Klonowska
took it calmly. The girl could mean anything-- black-market or currency business. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
could even be a chic partisan. Love might be the least of motivations. In any case, a
worldly girl like Klonowska didn't expect to own Oskar, or to be owned in return.
Inside the office, Schindler placed a chair for her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) and walked behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) desk beneath the
ritual portrait of the F@uhrer. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) like a cigarette? Perhaps a Pernod or a cognac?
No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) must, of course, feel free to take a drink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) poured himself one from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) cocktail cabinet. What's this very important business? he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) asked, not quite with that
crisp grace he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d shown on the stairs. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) manner had changed now the door to the
outer office was closed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) could tell she (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>)'d come to do hard business. She (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>)
leaned forward. For a second it seemed
ridiculous for her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>), a girl whose father had paid
50,000 z@l. for Aryan papers, to say it without
a pause, to give it all away to a
half-ironic, half-worried
Sudetendeutscher with a snifter of cognac in his (<font color='blue'><b>Aryan</b></font>) hand. Yet in some ways it was the
easiest thing she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d ever done.
I have to tell you, Herr Schindler, I'm not a Polish Aryan. My real name is Perlman.
My parents are in P@lasz@ow. They say, and I believe it, that coming to Emalia is the
same as being given a Lebenskarte--a card of life. I have nothing I can give you; I
borrowed clothes to get inside your factory. Will you bring them here for me?
Schindler put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) drink and stood up. You want to make a secret arrangement? I
don't make secret arrangements. What you suggest, Fraulein, is illegal. I have a factory
here in Zablocie and the only question I ask is whether or not a person has certain skills.
If you care to leave your Aryan name and address, it might be possible to write to you at
some stage and inform you that I need your parents for their work skills. But not now,
and not on any other ground. But they can't come as skilled workers, said Fraulein
Perlman. My father's an importer, not a metalworker.
We have an office staff, said Schindler. But mainly we need skills on the factory floor.
She (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) was defeated. Half-blind with tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) false name and real address--he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
could do with it whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) wanted. But on the street she (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) understood and began to
revive. Maybe Schindler thought she (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) might be an agent, that she (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) might have been there
for entrapment. Just the same, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d been cold. There hadn't even been an ambiguous,
nonindictable gesture of kindness in the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
office.
Within a month Mr. and Mrs. Perlman came to Emalia from P@lasz@ow. Not on their
own, as Regina Perlman had imagined it would happen should Herr Oskar Schindler
decide to be merciful, but as part of a new detail of 30 workers.
Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>) would go around to Lipowa Street and
bribe her (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>) way onto the factory floor to see
them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>) father worked dipping the enamel, shoveling
coal, clearing the floor of scrap. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>)
talks again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Perlman</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Perlman to her (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>)
daughter. For in P@lasz@ow he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d gone
silent.
In fact, despite the drafty huts, the
plumbing, here at Emalia there was a certain mood, a fragile confidence, a presumption
of permanence such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>), living on risky papers in sullen Cracow, could not hope to
feel until the day the madness stopped.
Miss Perlman-Rodriguez did not complicate Herr Schindler's life by storming his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) office
in gratitude or writing effusive letters. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Perlman</b></font>) always left the yellow gate of DEF with an
unquenchable envy for those who stayed inside.
Then there was a campaign to get Rabbi
Menasha Levartov, masquerading as a
metalworker in P@lasz@ow, into Emalia. Levartov was a scholarly city rabbi, young
and black-bearded. He (<font color='blue'><b>rabbi</b></font>) was more liberal than the rabbis from the shtetls of Poland, the
ones who believed the Sabbath was more important even than life and who, throughout
1942 and 1943, were shot by the hundreds every Friday evening for refusing work in the
forced-labor cantonments of Poland. He (<font color='blue'><b>rabbi</b></font>) was one of those men who, even in the years of
peace, would have advised his (<font color='blue'><b>rabbi</b></font>) congregation that while God may well be honored by the
inflexibility of the pious, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might also be honored by the flexibility of the sensible.
Levartov had always been admired by Itzhak Stern, who worked in the Construction
Office of Amon Goeth's Administration Building. In the old days, Stern and Levartov
would, if given the leisure, have sat together for hours over a glass of herbata, letting it
grow cold while they talked about the influence of Zoroaster on Judaism, or the other
way round, or the concept of the natural world in Taoism. Stern, when it came to
comparative religion, got greater pleasure out of talking to Levartov than he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) could ever
have received from bluff Oskar Schindler, who nonetheless had a fatal weakness for
discoursing on the same subject.
During one of Oskar's visits to P@lasz@ow, Stern told him (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) that somehow Menasha
Levartov had to be got into Emalia, or else Goeth would surely kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>). For Levartov
had a sort of visibility--it was a matter of presence. Goeth was drawn to people of
presence; they were, like idlers, another class with high target priority. Stern told Oskar
how Goeth had attempted to murder Levartov.
Amon Goeth's camp now held more than
30,000 people. On the near side of the
Appellplatz, near the Jewish
mortuary chapel which had now become a stable, stood a Polish compound which could
hold some 1,200 prisoners. Obergruppenf@uhrer Kr@uger was so pleased by his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>)
inspection of the new, booming camp that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) now promoted the Commandant two SS
grades to the rank of Hauptsturmf@uhrer.
As well as the crowd of Poles, Jews from the East and from Czechoslovakia would be
held in P@lasz@ow while space was made for them farther west in Auschwitz-Birkenau
or Gr@oss-Rosen. Sometimes the population rose above 35,000 and the Appellplatz
teemed at roll call. Amon therefore often had to cull his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) early comers to make way for
new prisoners. And Oskar knew that the Commandant's quick method was to enter one
of the camp offices or workshops, form up two lines, and march one of them away. The
line marched away would be taken either to the Austrian hill fort, for execution by firing
squads, or else to the cattle cars at the Cracow-P@lasz@ow Station or, when it was laid
down in the autumn of 1943, to the railway siding by the fortified SS barracks.
On just such a culling exercise, Stern told Oskar, Amon had entered the metalworks in
the factory enclosure some days past. The supervisors had stood at attention like soldiers
and made their eager reports, knowing that they could die for an unwise choice of words.
<div class="bookquote">``I need twenty-five metalworkers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>Amon told the supervisors when the reports were
finished. <div class="bookquote">``Twenty-five and no more. Point out to me the ones who are skilled.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the supervisors</b></font>)</div>One of the supervisors pointed to Levartov and the rabbi joined the line, though he (<font color='blue'><b>rabbi</b></font>) could
see that Amon took a special note of his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) selection. Of course, one never knew which line
would be moved out or where it would be moved to, but it was in most cases a safer bet
to be on the line of the skilled.
So the selection continued. Levartov had noticed that the metal shops were strangely
empty that morning, since a number of those who worked or filled in time by the door
had got forewarning of Goeth's approach and had slipped over to the Madritsch garment
factory to hide among the bolts of linen or appear to be mending sewing machines. The
forty or so slow or inadvertent who had stayed on in the metalworks were now in two
lines between the benches and the lathes. Everyone was fearful, but those in the smaller
line were the more uneasy.
Then a boy of indeterminate age, perhaps as young as sixteen or as old as nineteen, had
called from the midst of the shorter line, <div class="bookquote">``But, Herr Commandant, I'm a metal specialist
too.''  (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Liebchen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>murmured Amon, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) service revolver, stepping to the
child and shooting him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) in the head. The enormous blast in this place of metal threw the
boy against the wall. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was dead, the appalled Levartov believed, before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fell to the
workshop floor.
The even shorter line was now marched out to the railroad depot, the boy's corpse was
taken over the hill in a barrow, the floor was washed, the lathes returned to operation. But
Levartov, making gate hinges slowly at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bench, was aware of the recognition that had
flashed for an instant in Amon's eye--the look that had said, There's one. It seemed to
the rabbi that the boy had, by crying out, only temporarily distracted Amon from
Levartov himself, the more obvious target.
A few days had passed, Stern told
Schindler, before Amon returned to the metalworks and found it crowded, and went
around making his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) own selections for the hill or the transports. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)'d halted by
Levartov's bench, as Levartov had known he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would. Levartov could smell Amon's aftershave
lotion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) could see the starched cuff of Amon's shirt. Amon was a splendid
dresser.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you making?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Commandant</b></font>)</div>asked the Commandant. <div class="bookquote">``Herr Commandant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levartov/Menasha Levartov</b></font>)</div>said Levartov, <div class="bookquote">``I
am making hinges.''  (<font color='red'><b>Levartov/Menasha Levartov</b></font>)</div>The rabbi pointed, in fact, to the small heap of hinges on the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``Make me one now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>Amon ordered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) took a watch from his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) pocket and began timing.
Levartov earnestly cut a hinge, his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) fingers urging the metal, pressuring the lathe;
convinced laboring fingers, delighted to be skilled.
Keeping tremulous count in his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) turned out a hinge in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) believed was fiftyeight
seconds, and let it fall at his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) feet.
<div class="bookquote">``Another,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>murmured Amon. After his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) speed trial, the rabbi was now more assured and
worked confidently. In perhaps another minute the second hinge slid to his (<font color='blue'><b>rabbi</b></font>) feet.
Amon considered the heap. <div class="bookquote">``You've been working here since six this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>said
Amon, not raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) eyes from the floor. <div class="bookquote">``And you can work at a rate you've just shown
me--and yet, such a tiny little pile of hinges?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levartov/Menasha Levartov</b></font>)</div>Levartov knew, of course, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had crafted his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) own death. Amon walked him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) down the
aisle, no one bothering or brave enough to look up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) bench. To see what? A death
walk. Death walks were commonplace in P@lasz@ow. Outside, in the midday air of
spring, Amon stood Menasha Levartov against the workshop wall, adjusting him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) by the
shoulder, and took out the pistol with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)'d slaughtered the child two days before.
Levartov blinked and watched the other prisoners hurry by, wheeling and toting the raw
materials of the P@lasz@ow camp, eager to be out of range, the Cracovians among them
thinking, My God, it's Levartov's turn.
Privately, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) murmured the Shema
Yisroel and heard the mechanisms of the pistol. But the small internal stirrings of metal
ended not in a roar but in a click like that of a cigarette lighter which won't give a flame.
And like a dissatisfied smoker, with just such a trivial level of annoyance, Amon Goeth
extracted and replaced the magazine of bullets from the butt of the pistol, again took his (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>)
aim, and fired. As the rabbi's head swayed to the normal human suspicion that the impact
of the bullet could be absorbed as could a punch, all that emerged from Goeth's pistol
was another click.
Goeth began cursing prosaically.
<div class="bookquote">``Donnerwetter! Zum Teufel!''  (<font color='red'><b>Levartov/Menasha Levartov</b></font>)</div>It seemed to Levartov that at any second Amon would
begin to run down faulty modern workmanship, as if they were two tradesmen trying to
bring off some simple effect--the threading of a pipe, a drill hole in the wall. Amon put
the faulty pistol away in its black holster and withdrew from a jacket pocket a pearlhandled
revolver, of a type Rabbi Levartov had only read of in the Westerns of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rabbi</b></font>)
boyhood. Clearly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rabbi</b></font>) thought, there are going to be no remissions due to technical failure.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Rabbi</b></font>)'ll keep on.
I'll die by cowboy revolver, and even if all
the firing pins are filed down,
Hauptsturmf@uhrer Goeth will fall
back on more primitive weapons.
As Stern relayed it to Schindler, when Goeth aimed again and fired, Menasha Levartov
had already begun to look about in case there was some object in the neighborhood that
could be used, together with these two astounding failures of Goeth's service pistol, as a
lever. By the corner of the wall stood a pile of coal, an unpromising item in itself. <div class="bookquote">``Herr
Commandant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Levartov/Menasha Levartov</b></font>)</div>Levartov began to say, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) could already hear the small murderous
hammers and springs of the barroom pistol acting on each other. And again the click of a
defective cigarette lighter. Amon, raging, seemed to be attempting to tear the barrel of the
thing from its socket.
Now Rabbi Levartov adopted the stance he (<font color='blue'><b>Rabbi</b></font>) had seen the supervisors in the metalworks
assume. <div class="bookquote">``Herr Commandant, I would beg to report that my heap of hinges was so
unsatisfactory for the reason that the machines were being recalibrated this morning. And
therefore instead of hinge-work I was put on to shoveling that coal.''  (<font color='red'><b>Levartov/Menasha Levartov</b></font>)</div>It seemed to
Levartov that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rabbi</b></font>) had violated the rules of the game they had been playing together, the
game that was to be closed by Levartov's reasonable death just as surely as Snakes and
Ladders ends with the throwing of a six. It was as if the rabbi had hidden the dice and
now there could be no conclusion. Amon hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) on the face with a free left hand, and
Levartov tasted blood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) mouth, lying on the tongue like a guarantee.
Hauptsturmf@uhrer Goeth then simply abandoned Levartov against the wall. The
contest, however, as both Levartov and Stern could tell, had merely been suspended.
Stern whispered this narrative to Oskar in the Building Office of P@lasz@ow. Stern,
stooping, eyes raised, hands joined, was as generous with detail as ever. <div class="bookquote">``It's no
problem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar murmured. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) liked to tease Stern. <div class="bookquote">``Why the long story? There's
always room at Emalia for someone who can turn out a hinge in less than a minute.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Levartov/Menasha Levartov</b></font>)</div>When Levartov and his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) wife came to the Emalia factory subcamp in the summer of `43,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) had to suffer what at first he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) believed to be Schindler's little religious witticisms. On
Friday afternoons, in the munitions hall of DEF where Levartov operated a lathe,
Schindler would say, <div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't be here, Rabbi.
You should be preparing for Shabbat.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>But when
Oskar slipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) a bottle of wine for use in
the ceremonies, Levartov knew that the Herr
Direktor was not joking. Before dusk
on Fridays, the rabbi would be dismissed from his (<font color='blue'><b>rabbi</b></font>)
workbench and would go to his (<font color='blue'><b>rabbi</b></font>) barracks behind the wire in
the backyard of DEF. There, under the strings of
sourly drying laundry, he (<font color='blue'><b>rabbi</b></font>) would recite
Kiddush over a cup of wine among the
roof-high tiers of bunks. Under, of course, the shadow of an SS watchtower.

<p/>CHAPTER 24
The Oskar Schindler who dismounted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) horse these days in the factory yard of
Emalia was still the prototypical tycoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>tycoon</b></font>) looked sleekly handsome in the style of the
film stars George Sanders and Curt J@urgens, to both of whom people would always
compare him (<font color='blue'><b>Curt</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Curt</b></font>) hacking jacket and jodhpurs were tailored; his (<font color='blue'><b>Curt</b></font>) riding boots had a high
shine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Curt</b></font>) looked like a man to whom it was profit all the way.
Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Curt</b></font>) would return from his (<font color='blue'><b>Curt</b></font>) rural rides and go upstairs to face the sort of bills novel
even to the history of an eccentric enterprise like DEF.
Bread shipments from the bakery at P@lasz@ow
to the factory camp in Lipowa Street,
Zablocie, were a few hundred loaves
delivered twice a week and an occasional token half-truckload of turnips. These few
high-backed and lightly laden trucks were no doubt written large and multiplied in
Commandant Goeth's books, and such trusties as Chilowicz sold off on behalf of the
Herr Hauptsturmf@uhrer the difference between the mean supplies that arrived at
Lipowa Street and the plenteous and phantom convoys that Goeth put down on paper. If
Oskar had depended on Amon for prison food, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) 900 internees would each have been
fed perhaps three-quarters of a kilo of bread a week and soup every third day. On
missions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) own and through his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) manager, Oskar was spending 50,000 z@l. a month
on black-market food for his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) camp kitchen. Some weeks he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had to find more than three
thousand round loaves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) went to town and spoke to the German supervisors in the big
bakeries, and had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) briefcase Reichsmarks and two or three bottles.
Oskar did not seem to realize that throughout Poland that summer of 1943, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was one of
the champion illicit feeders of prisoners; that the malign pall of hunger which should by
SS policy hang over the great death factories and over every one of the little, barbedwired
forced-labor slums was lacking in Lipowa Street in a way that was dangerously
visible. That summer a host of incidents occurred which augmented the Schindler
mythology, the almost religious supposition among many prisoners of P@lasz@ow and
the entire population of Emalia that Oskar was a provider of outrageous salvation.
Early in the career of every subcamp, senior
officers from the parent camp, or Lager, paid a
visit to ensure that the energy of the slave laborers
was stimulated in the most radical and exemplary
manner. It is not certain exactly which members
of P@lasz@ow's senior staff visited
Emalia, but some prisoners and Oskar himself would
always say that Goeth was one of them. And if not
Goeth it was Leo John, or Scheidt. Or
else Josef Neuschel, Goeth's
prot@eg`e. It is no injustice to mention any of their names in connection with
<div class="bookquote">``stimulating energy in a radical and exemplary manner.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Whoever they were, they had
already in the history of P@lasz@ow taken or condoned fierce action. And now, visiting
Emalia, they spotted in the yard a prisoner named Lamus pushing a barrow too slowly
across the factory yard. Oskar himself later declared that it was Goeth who was there that
day and saw Lamus' slow trundling and turned to a young NCO named Gr@un--Gr@un
being another Goeth prot@eg`e, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) bodyguard, a former wrestler. It was certainly
Gr@un who was ordered to execute Lamus.
So Gr@un made the arrest, and the inspectors continued on into other parts of the factory
camp. It was someone from the metal hall who rushed up to the Herr Direktor's office
and alerted Schindler. Oskar came roaring down the stairs even faster than on the day
Miss Regina Perlman had visited, and reached the yard just as Gr@un was positioning
Lamus against the wall. Oskar called out, You can't do that here. I won't get work out of
my people if you start shooting. I've got high-priority war contracts, et cetera. It was the
standard Schindler argument and carried the suggestion that there were senior officers
known to Oskar to whom Gr@un's name would be given if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) impeded production in
Emalia.
Gr@un was cunning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) knew the other inspectors had passed on to the workshops,
where the whumping of metal presses and the roaring of lathes would cover any noise he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
chose, or failed, to make. Lamus was such a small concern to men like Goeth and John
that no investigation would be made afterward. <div class="bookquote">``What's in it for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the SS man</b></font>)</div>the SS man asked
Oskar. <div class="bookquote">``Would vodka do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar.
To Gr@un it was a substantial prize. For working all day behind the machine guns during
Aktions, the massed and daily executions in the East--for shooting hundreds--you were
given half a liter of vodka. The boys lined up to be on the squad so that they could take
that prize of liquor back to their messes in the evening. And here the Herr Direktor
offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) three times that for one act of omission.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't see the bottle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) said. Herr
Schindler was already nudging Lamus away from the wall and pushing him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) out of range.
<div class="bookquote">``Disappear!''  (<font color='red'><b>the wheelbarrow man</b></font>)</div>Gr@un yelled at the wheelbarrow man. <div class="bookquote">``You may collect the bottle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said
Oskar, <div class="bookquote">``from my office at the end of the inspection.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar took part in a similar transaction when the Gestapo raided the apartment of a forger
and discovered, among other false documents completed or near-completed, a set of
Aryan papers for a family called the Wohlfeilers--mother, father, three adolescent
children, all of them workers at Schindler's camp. Two Gestapo men therefore came to
Lipowa Street to collect the family for an interrogation which would lead, through
Montelupich prison, to Chujowa G@orka. Three hours after entering Oskar's office both
men left, reeling on the stairs, beaming with the temporary bonhomie of cognac and, for
all anyone knew, of a payoff. The confiscated papers now lay on Oskar's desk, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
picked them up and put them in the fire.
Next, the brothers Danziger, who cracked a metal press one Friday. Honest, bemused
men, semiskilled, looking up with staring shtetl eyes from the machine they had just
loudly shattered. The Herr Direktor was away on business, and someone--a factory spy,
Oskar would always say--denounced the Danzigers to the administration in
P@lasz@ow. The brothers were taken from Emalia and their hanging advertised at the
next morning's roll call in P@lasz@ow. Tonight -LRB-it was announced-RRB-, the people of
P@lasz@ow will witness the execution of two saboteurs. What of course qualified the
Danzigers above all for execution was their Orthodox aura.
Oskar returned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) business trip to Sosnowiec at three o'clock on Saturday
afternoon, three hours before the promised execution. News of the sentence was waiting
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) desk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) drove out through the suburbs to P@lasz@ow at once, taking cognac
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) and some fine kielbasa sausage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) parked by the Administration Building and
found Goeth in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) office. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was pleased not to have to rouse the Commandant from an
afternoon nap. No one knows the extent of the deal that was struck in Goeth's office that
afternoon, in that office akin to Torquemada's, where Goeth had had ringbolts attached to
the wall from which to hang people for discipline or instruction. It is hard to believe,
however, that Amon was satisfied simply with cognac and sausage. In any case, his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
concern for the integrity of the Reich's metal presses was soothed by the interview, and at
six o'clock, the hour of their execution, the Danziger brothers returned in the back seat of
Oskar's plush limousine to the sweet squalor of Emalia.
All these triumphs were, of course,
partial. It is an aspect of Caesars,
Oskar knew, to remit as irrationally as they
condemn. Emil Krautwirt, by day an engineer
in the radiator factory beyond the Emalia
barracks, was an inmate of Oskar's SS
subcamp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was young, having got his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) diploma
in the late Thirties. Krautwirt, like the
others in Emalia, called the place
Schindler's camp, but by taking Krautwirt away to P@lasz@ow for an exemplary
hanging, the SS demonstrated whose camp it really was, at least for some aspects of its
existence. For the fraction of P@lasz@ow people who would live on into the Peace, the
hanging of engineer Krautwirt was the first story, other than their own intimate stories of
pain and humiliation, which they would relate. The SS were ever economical with their
scaffolds, and at P@lasz@ow the gallows resembled a long, low set of goalposts, lacking
the majesty of the gibbets of history, of the Revolutionary guillotine, the Elizabethan
scaffold, the tall solemnity of jailhouse gallows in the sheriff's backyard.
Seen in peacetime, the gallows of P@lasz@ow and Auschwitz would intimidate not by
their solemnity but by their ordinariness. But as mothers of children would discover in
P@lasz@ow, it was still possible, even with such a banal structure, for five-year-olds to
see too much of an execution from within the mass of prisoners on the Appellplatz. With
Krautwirt, a sixteen-year-old boy named Haubenstock was also to be hanged. Krautwirt
had been condemned for some letters he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had written to seditious persons in the city of
Cracow. But with Haubenstock, it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been heard singing <div class="bookquote">``Volga, Volga,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Kalinka Maya,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and other banned Russian songs with the intention, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
death sentence, of winning the Ukrainian guards over to Bolshevism.
The rules for the rite of execution inside P@lasz@ow involved silence. Unlike the festive
hangings of earlier times, the drop was performed in utter stillness. The prisoners stood in
phalanxes, and were patrolled by men and women who knew the extent of their power:
by Hujar and John; by Scheidt and Gr@un; by the NCO'S Landsdorfer, Amthor, and
Grimm, Ritschek and Schreiber; and by the SS women supervisors recently assigned to
P@lasz@ow, both of them accomplished with the truncheon--Alice Orlowski and Luise
Danz. Under such supervision, the pleadings of the condemned were heard in silence.
Engineer Krautwirt himself seemed at first stunned and had nothing to say, but the boy
was vocal. In an uneven voice he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) reasoned with the Hauptsturmf@uhrer, who stood
beside the scaffold. <div class="bookquote">``I am not a Communist, Herr Commandant. I hate Communism.
They were just songs. Ordinary songs.''  (<font color='red'><b>The hangman butcher</b></font>)</div>The hangman, a Jewish butcher of Cracow,
pardoned for some earlier crime on condition that he (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) undertake this work, stood
Haubenstock on a stool and placed the noose around his (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) neck. He (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) could tell Amon
wanted the boy hanged first, didn't want the debate to drag on. When the butcher kicked
the support out from beneath Haubenstock, the rope broke, and the boy, purple and
gagging, noose around his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) neck, crawled on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands and knees to Goeth, continuing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
pleadings, ramming his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head against the Commandant's ankles and hugging his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) legs. It
was the most extreme submission; it conferred on Goeth again the kingship he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d been
exercising these fevered months past. Amon, in an Appellplatz of gaping mouths uttering
no sound but a low hiss, a susurrus like a wind in sand dunes, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) pistol from his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
holster, kicked the boy away, and shot him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) through the head.
When poor engineer Krautwirt saw the
horror of the boy's execution, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took a
razor blade that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d concealed in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pocket and slashed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wrists. Those prisoners at
the front could tell that Krautwirt had injured himself fatally in both arms. But Goeth
ordered the hangman to proceed in any case, and splashed with the gore from Krautwirt's
injuries, two Ukrainians lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) to the scaffold, where, gushing from both wrists, he (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>)
strangled in front of the Jews of southern Poland.
It was natural to believe with one part of the mind that each such barbarous exhibition
might be the last, that there might be a reversal of methods and attitudes even in Amon,
or if not in him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>), then in those unseen officials who in some high office with French
windows and waxed floors, overlooking a square where old women sold flowers, must
formulate half of what happened in P@lasz@ow and condone the rest.
On the second visit of Dr. Sedlacek from Budapest to Cracow, Oskar and the dentist
devised a scheme which might to a more introverted man than Schindler have seemed
naive. Oskar suggested to Sedlacek that perhaps one of the reasons Amon Goeth behaved
so savagely was the bad liquor he (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) drank, the gallons of local so-called cognac which
weakened even further Amon's faulty sense of ultimate consequences. With a portion of
the Reichsmarks Dr. Sedlacek had just brought to Emalia and handed to Oskar, a crate of
first-rate cognac should be bought--not such an easy or inexpensive item in postStalingrad
Poland. Oskar should deliver it to Amon, and in the progress of conversation
suggest to Goeth that one way or another the war would end at some time, and that there
would be investigations into the actions of individuals. That perhaps even Amon's friends
would remember the times he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)'d been too zealous. It was Oskar's nature to believe that
you could drink with the devil and adjust the balance of evil over a snifter of cognac. It
was not that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) found more radical methods frightening. It was that they did not occur to
him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'d always been a man of transactions.
Wachtmeister Oswald Bosko, who had earlier had control of the ghetto perimeter, was, in
contrast, a man of ideas. It had become impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to work within the SS scheme,
passing a bribe here, a forged paper there, placing a dozen children under the patronage
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rank while a hundred more were marched out the ghetto gate. Bosko had
absconded from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) police station in Podg@orze and vanished into the partisan forests of
Niepolomice. In the People's Army he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would try to expiate the callow enthusiasm he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d
felt for Nazism in the summer of 1938. Dressed as a Polish farmer, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)'d be recognized in
the end in a village west of Cracow and shot for treason. Bosko would therefore become
a martyour. Bosko had gone to the forest because he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had no other option. He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) lacked the
financial resources with which Oskar greased the system. But it accorded with the natures
of both men that one be found with nothing but a cast-off rank and uniform, that the other
would make certain he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had cash and trade goods. It is not to praise Bosko or denigrate
Schindler that one says that if ever Oskar suffered martyrdom, it would be by accident,
because some business he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was transacting had turned sour on him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). But there were people
who still drew breath--the Wohlfeilers, the Danziger brothers, Lamus--because Oskar
worked that way. Because Oskar worked that way, the unlikely camp of Emalia stood in
Lipowa Street, and there, on most days, a thousand were safe from seizure, and the SS
stayed outside the wire. No one was beaten there, and the soup was thick enough to
sustain life. In proportion to their natures, the moral disgust of both Party members,
Bosko and Schindler, was equal, even if Bosko manifested his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) by leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) empty
uniform on a coat hanger in Podg@orze, while Oskar put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) big Party pin and went to
deliver high-class liquor to mad Amon Goeth in P@lasz@ow.
It was late afternoon, and Oskar and Goeth sat in the salon of Goeth's white villa.
Goeth's girlfriend Majola looked in, a small-boned woman, a secretary at the Wagner
factory in town. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not spend her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) days amid the excesses of P@lasz@ow. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
sensitive manners, and this delicacy helped a rumor to emerge that Majola had threatened
not to sleep with Goeth if he (<font color='blue'><b>Majola</b></font>) continued arbitrarily gunning people down. But no one
knew whether that was the truth or just one of those therapeutic interpretations which
arise in the minds of prisoners desperate to make the earth habitable.
Majola did not stay long with Amon and Oskar that afternoon. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could tell there would
be a drinking session. Helen Hirsch, the pale girl in black who was Amon's maid,
brought them the necessary accompaniments--cakes, canap`es, sausage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) reeled with
exhaustion. Last night Amon had beaten her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) for preparing food for Majola without his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
permission; this morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) run up and down the villa's three flights of
stairs fifty times on the double because of a flyspeck on one of the paintings in the
corridor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) had heard certain rumors about Herr Schindler but had not met him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) until
now. This afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) took no comfort from the sight of these two big men, seated
either side of the low table, fraternal and in apparent concord. There was nothing here to
interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>), for the certainty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) own death was a first premise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) thought only about
the survival of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) young sister, who worked in the camp's general kitchen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) kept a
sum of money hidden in the hope that it would effect her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) sister's survival. There was no
sum, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) believed, no deal, that could influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) own prospects.
So they drank through the camp's twilight and into the dark. Long after the prisoner
Tosia Lieberman's nightly rendition of Brahms's <div class="bookquote">``Lullaby''  (<font color='red'><b>Brahms</b></font>)</div>had calmed the women's
camp and insinuated itself between the timbers of the men's, the two big men sat on.
Their prodigious livers glowed hot as furnaces. And at the right hour, Oskar leaned across
the table and, acting out of an amity which, even with this much cognac aboard, did not
go beyond the surface of the skin ... Oskar, leaning toward Amon and cunning as a
demon, began to tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) toward restraint.
Amon took it well. It seemed to Oskar that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was attracted by the thought of moderation--a
temptation worthy of an emperor. Amon could
imagine a sick slave on the trolleys, a
returning prisoner from the cable factory, staggering
--in that put-upon way one found so hard to tolerate--under a load of clothing or lumber
picked up at the prison gate. And the fantasy ran with a strange warmth in Amon's belly
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would forgive that laggard, that pathetic actor. As Caligula might have been
tempted to see himself as Caligula the Good, so the image of Amon the Good exercised
the Commandant's imagination for a time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would, in fact, always have a weakness for
it. Tonight, his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) blood running golden with cognac and nearly all the camp asleep beyond
his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) steps, Amon was more definitely seduced by mercy than by the fear of reprisal. But in
the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would remember Oskar's warning and combine it with the day's news
that Russian threats were developing on the Front at Kiev. Stalingrad had been an
inconceivable distance from P@lasz@ow. But the distance to Kiev was imaginable.
For some days after Oskar's bout with Amon, news came to Emalia that the dual
temptation was having its result with the Commandant. Dr. Sedlacek, going back to
Budapest, would report to Samu Springmann that Amon had given up, for the time being
at least, arbitrarily murdering people. And gentle Samu, among the diverse cares he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had
in the list of places from Dachau and Drancy in the west to Sobibor and Bel@zec in the
east, hoped for a time that the hole at P@lasz@ow had been plugged.
But the allure of clemency vanished quickly.
If there was a brief respite, those who were
to survive and give testimony of their days in
P@lasz@ow would not be aware of it. The summary
assassinations would seem continual to them. If
Amon did not appear on his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) balcony this morning
or the next, it did not mean he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would not appear the
morning after that. It took much more than Goeth's
temporary absence to give even the most deluded
prisoner some hope of a fundamental change in the
Commandant's nature. And then, in any case,
there he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) would be, on the steps in the
Austrian-style cap he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) wore to murders,
looking through his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) binoculars for a culprit.
Dr. Sedlacek would return to Budapest not
only with overly hopeful news of a reform in
Amon but with more reliable data on the camp at
P@lasz@ow. One afternoon a guard from Emalia
turned up at P@lasz@ow to summon Stern
to Zablocie. Once Stern arrived at the
front gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) was led upstairs into Oskar's
new apartment. There Oskar introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to two
men in good suits. One was Sedlacek; the other a
Jew--equipped with a Swiss passport--who
introduced himself as Babar. <div class="bookquote">``My dear
friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar told Stern, <div class="bookquote">``I want you
to write as full a report on the situation in P@lasz@ow as you can manage in an
afternoon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Stern/Itzhak Stern/Itzhak</b></font>)</div>Stern had never seen Sedlacek or Babar before this and thought that Oskar
was being indiscreet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) bent over his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) hands, murmuring that before he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) undertook a task
like that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would like a word in private with the Herr Direktor.
Oskar used to say that Itzhak Stern could never make a straight statement or request
unless it arrived smuggled under a baggage of talk of the Babylonian Talmud and
purification rites. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) was more direct. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, please, Herr Schindler,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>)
asked, <div class="bookquote">``don't you believe this is a dreadful risk?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Oskar exploded. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) got control of himself, the strangers would have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) in
the other room. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think I'd ask you, if there was a risk?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) calmed and said,
<div class="bookquote">``There's always risk, as you know better than I. But not with these two men. These two
are safe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In the end, Stern spent all afternoon on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) report. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) was a scholar and accustomed to
writing in exact prose. The rescue organization in Budapest, the Zionists in Istanbul
would receive from Stern a report they could rely on.
Multiply Stern's summary by the 1,700 large and small forced-labor camps of Poland,
and then you had a tapestry to stun the world!
Sedlacek and Oskar wanted more than that of
Stern. On the morning after the Amon-Oskar
binge, Oskar dragged his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) heroic liver back out
to P@lasz@ow before office-opening time. In between the
suggestions of tolerance Oskar had tried to drop
into Amon's ear the night before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d also got a
written permit to take two <div class="bookquote">``brother
industrialists''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>on a tour of this model
industrial community. Oskar brought the two into the gray Administration Building that
morning and demanded the services of H@aftling -LRB-prisoner-RRB- Itzhak Stern for a tour of the
camp. Sedlacek's friend Babar had some sort of miniature camera, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Babar</b></font>) carried it
openly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Babar</b></font>) hand. It was almost possible to believe that if an SS man had challenged
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have welcomed the chance to stand and boast for five minutes about this
little gadget he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d got on a recent business trip to Brussels or Stockholm.
As Oskar and the visitors from Budapest emerged from the Administration Building,
Oskar took the thin, clerkly Stern by the shoulder. His (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) friends would be happy to see the
workshops and the living quarters, said Oskar. But if there was anything Stern thought
they were missing out on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) was just to bend down and tie his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) shoestring.
On Goeth's great road paved with fractured gravestones, they moved past the SS
barracks. Here, almost at once, prisoner Stern's shoestring needed tying. Sedlacek's
associate snapped the teams hauling truckloads of rock up from the quarry, while Stern
murmured, <div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, gentlemen.''  (<font color='red'><b>Stern/Itzhak Stern/Itzhak</b></font>)</div>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) time with the tying so that they
could look down and read the monumental fragments. Here were the gravestones of
Bluma Gemeinerowa -LRB-1859-1927-RRB-; of Matylde Liebeskind, deceased at the age of 90 in
1912; of Helena Wachsberg, who died in childbirth in 1911; of Rozia Groder, a thirteenyear-old
who had passed on in 1931; of Sofia Rosner and Adolf Gottlieb, who had died in
the reign of Franz Josef. Stern wanted them to see that the names of the honorable dead
had been made into paving stones.
Moving on, they passed the Puffhaus, the SS and Ukrainian brothel staffed by Polish
girls, before reaching the quarry, the excavations running back into the limestone cliff.
Stern's shoelaces required reef knots here; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) wanted this recorded. They destroyed men
at this rock face, working them on the hammers and wedges. None of the scarred men of
the quarry parties showed any curiosity about their visitors this morning. Ivan, Amon
Goeth's Ukrainian driver, was on duty here, and the supervisor was a bullet-headed
German criminal named Erik.
Erik had already demonstrated a capacity for
murdering families, having killed his (<font color='blue'><b>Erik</b></font>) own mother,
father, sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>Erik</b></font>) might by now have been hanged or
at least been put in a dungeon if the SS
had not realized that there were worse criminals still
than patricides and that Erik should be employed as
a stick to beat them with. As Stern had mentioned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>)
report, a Cracow physician named Edward
Goldblatt had been sent here from the clinic
by SS Dr. Blancke and his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) Jewish
prot@eg`e, Dr. Leon Gross. Erik
loved to see a man of culture and speciality enter the quarry and report soft-handed for
work, and the beatings began in Goldblatt's case with the first display of uncertainty in
handling the hammer and spikes. Over a period of days, Erik and sundry SS and
Ukrainian enlisted men beat Goldblatt. The doctor was forced to work with a ballooning
face, now half again its normal size, with one eye sealed up. No one knew what error of
quarry technique set Erik to give Dr. Goldblatt his (<font color='blue'><b>Erik</b></font>) final beating.
Long after the doctor lost consciousness, Erik
permitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Erik</b></font>) to be carried to the
Krankenstube, where Dr. Leon Gross
refused to admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Gross</b></font>). With this medical sanction Erik and an SS enlisted man continued
to kick the dying Goldblatt as he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldblatt</b></font>) lay, rejected for treatment, on the threshold of the
hospital. Stern bent and tied his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) shoelace at the quarry because, like Oskar and some
others in the P@lasz@ow complex, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) believed in a future of judges who might ask,
Where--in a word--did this act occur?
Oskar was able to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) colleagues an overview of the camp, taking them up to
Chujowa G@orka and the Austrian mound, where the bloodied wheelbarrows used to
transport the dead to the woods stood unabashedly at the mouth of the fort. Already
thousands were buried down there in mass graves in or on the verges of those eastern
pinewoods. When the Russians came from the east, that wood with its population of
victims would fall to them before living and half-dying P@lasz@ow.
As for P@lasz@ow as an industrial wonder, it was bound to disappoint any serious
observer.
Amon, Bosch, Leo John, Josef
Neuschel all thought it a model city on the ground that it was making them rich. It would
have shocked them to find that one of the reasons their sweet billet in P@lasz@ow
continued was not any delight on the part of the Armaments Inspectorate with the
economic miracles they were performing.
In fact the only economic miracles within
P@lasz@ow were the personal fortunes made
by Amon and his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) clique. It was a surprise
to any calm outsider that war contracts came to the
workshops of P@lasz@ow at all, considering that
their plant was so poor and old-fashioned. But
shrewd Zionist prisoners inside
P@lasz@ow put pressure on convinced
outsiders, people like Oskar and Madritsch, who could
in turn put pressure on the Armaments
Inspectorate. On the ground that the
hunger and sporadic murders of P@lasz@ow were still to be preferred to the assured
annihilations of Auschwitz and Bel@zec, Oskar was willing to sit down with the
purchasing officers and engineers of General Schindler's Arms Inspectorate.
These gentlemen would make faces and say, <div class="bookquote">``Come
on, Oskar! Are you serious?''  (<font color='red'><b>These gentlemen</b></font>)</div>But in the end they
would find contracts for Amon Goeth's camp,
orders for shovels manufactured from the
collected scrap iron of Oskar's Lipowa
Street factory, orders for funnels turned
out of offcuts of tin from a jam factory in Podg@orze. The chances of full delivery of the
shovels and their handles ever being made to the Wehrmacht were small. Many of
Oskar's friends among the officers of the Armaments Inspectorate understood what they
were doing, that prolonging the life of the slave-labor camp of P@lasz@ow was the same
thing as prolonging the life of a number of the slaves. With some of them it stuck in the
craw, because they knew what a crook Goeth was, and their serious and old-fashioned
patriotism was affronted by Amon's sybaritic life out there in the countryside.
The divine irony of Forced Labor Camp
P@lasz@ow--that some of the slaves were conspiring for their own purposes to
maintain Amon's kingdom-- can be seen in the case of Roman Ginter. Ginter, former
entrepreneur and now one of the supervisors in the metalworks from which Rabbi
Levartov had already been rescued, was summoned to Goeth's office one morning and,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rabbi</b></font>) closed the door, took the first of a number of blows. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Rabbi</b></font>) beat Ginter, Amon
raged incoherently. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) out-of-doors and down the steps to a stretch of
wall by the front entrance. May I ask something? said Ginter against the wall, spitting out
two teeth, offhandedly, lest Amon think him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) an actor, a self-pitier. You bastard, roared
Goeth, you haven't delivered the handcuffs I ordered! My desk calendar tells me that,
you pig's-ass. But Herr Commandant, said Ginter, I beg to report that the order for
handcuffs was filled yesterday. I asked Herr Oberscharf@uhrer Neuschel what I should
do with them and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ginter</b></font>) told me to deliver them to your office, which I did.
Amon dragged bleeding Ginter back to the office and called the SS man Neuschel. Why,
yes, said young Neuschel. Look in your second-top drawer on the left, Herr
Commandant. Goeth looked and found the manacles. I almost killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Herr</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Herr</b></font>) complained
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Herr</b></font>) young and not-so-gifted Viennese prot@eg`e.
This same Roman Ginter, complaisantly
spitting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ginter</b></font>) teeth against the foundation of Amon's
gray Administration Building--this Jewish
cipher whose accidental murder would have caused
Amon to blame Neuschel--this Ginter is the
man who under special pass goes to Herr
Schindler's DEF to talk to Oskar about workshop
supplies for P@lasz@ow, about large scrap
metal without which the whole metal-shop crew would be
railroaded off to Auschwitz. Therefore, while the
pistol-waving Amon Goeth believes he (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>)
maintains P@lasz@ow by his (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) special
administrative genius, it is as much the
bloody-mouthed prisoners who keep it running.

<p/>CHAPTER 25
To some people it now seemed that Oskar was spending like a compulsive gambler. Even
from the little they knew of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) prisoners could sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would ruin himself for
them if that was the price. Later--not now, for now they accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) mercies in the same
spirit in which a child accepts Christmas presents from its parents--they would say,
Thank God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was more faithful to us than to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife. And like the prisoners, sundry
officials could also ferret Oskar's passion out.
One such official, a Dr. Sopp,
physician to the SS prisons in Cracow and
to the SS Court -LSB-The SS had its own
judiciary section.-RSB- in Pomorska, let
Herr Schindler know through a Polish messenger that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was willing to do a brand of business. In
Montelupich prison was a woman named Frau
Helene Schindler. Dr. Sopp knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Helene</b></font>) was
no relative of Oskar's, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Helene</b></font>) husband had
invested some money in Emalia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helene</b></font>) had questionable
Aryan papers. Dr. Sopp did not need to say
that for Mrs. Schindler this portended a truck
ride to Chujowa G@orka. But if Oskar would
put up certain amounts, said Sopp, the
doctor was willing to issue a medical
certificate saying that, in view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) condition, Mrs. Schindler should be permitted to
take the cure indefinitely at Marienbad, down in Bohemia.
Oskar went to Sopp's office, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) found out that the doctor wanted 50,000 z@l. for
the certificate. It was no use arguing. After three years of practice, a man like Sopp could
tell to within a few z@loty the price to put on favors. During the afternoon, Oskar raised
the money. Sopp knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could, knew that Oskar was the sort of man who had blackmarket
money stashed, money with no recorded history. Before making the payment,
Oskar set some conditions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would need to go to Montelupich with Dr. Sopp to collect
the woman from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would himself deliver her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to mutual friends in the city.
Sopp did not object. Under a bare light bulb in freezing Montelupich, Mrs. Schindler was
handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) costly documents. A more careful man, a man with an accountant's mind,
might reasonably have repaid himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trouble from the money Sedlacek brought
from Budapest. All together, Oskar would be handed nearly 150,000 Reichsmarks carried
to Cracow in false-bottomed suitcases and in the lining of clothes. But Oskar, partly
because his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) sense of money -LRB-whether owed or owing-RRB- was so inexact, partly because of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) sense of honor, passed on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) Jewish contacts all the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) ever received from
Sedlacek, except for the sum spent on Amon's cognac.
It was not always a straightforward business. When in the summer of `43 Sedlacek
arrived in Cracow with 50,000 RM., the Zionists inside P@lasz@ow to whom Oskar
offered the cash feared it might be a setup.
Oskar first approached Henry Mandel, a welder in the P@lasz@ow metal shop and a
member of Hitach Dut, a Zionist youth and labor movement. Mandel did not want to
touch the money. Look, said Schindler, I've got a letter in Hebrew to go with it, a letter
from Palestine. But of course, if it was a setup, if Oskar had been compromised and was
being used, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would have a letter from Palestine. And when you hadn't enough bread for
breakfast, it was quite a sum to be offered: 50,000 RM.--100,000 z@loty. To be offered
that for your discretionary use. It just wasn't credible.
Schindler then tried to pass the money, which was sitting there, inside the boundary of
P@lasz@ow in the trunk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) car, to another member of Hitach Dut, a woman named
Alta Rubner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rubner</b></font>) had some contacts, through prisoners who went to work in the cable
factory, through some of the Poles in the Polish prison, with the underground in
Sosnowiec. Perhaps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rubner</b></font>) said to Mandel, it would be best to refer the whole business to
the underground, and let them decide on the provenance of the money Herr Oskar
Schindler was offering.
Oskar kept trying to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Rubner</b></font>), raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) voice at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rubner</b></font>) under cover of Madritsch's
chattering sewing machines. <div class="bookquote">``I guarantee with all my heart that this isn't a trap!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With all
my heart. Exactly the sentiment one would expect from an agent provocateur!
Yet after Oskar had gone away and Mandel had spoken to Stern, who declared the letter
authentic, and then conferred again with the girl, a decision was made to take the money.
They knew now, however, that Oskar wouldn't be back with it. Mandel went to Marcel
Goldberg at the Administration Office. Goldberg had also been a member of Hitach Dut,
but after becoming the clerk in charge of lists--of labor lists and transport lists, of the
lists of living and dead--he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) had begun taking bribes. Mandel could put pressure on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mandel</b></font>),
though. One of the lists Goldberg could draw up--or at least, add to and subtract from--
was the list of those who went to Emalia to collect scrap metal for use in the workshops
of P@lasz@ow. For old times' sake, and without having to disclose his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) reason for
wanting to visit Emalia, Mandel was put on this list.
But arriving in Zablocie and sneaking away from the scrap-metal detail to get to Oskar,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d been blocked in the front office by Bankier. Herr Schindler was too busy, said
Bankier. A week later Mandel was back. Again Bankier wouldn't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Mandel</b></font>) in to speak to
Oskar. The third time, Bankier was more specific. You want that Zionist money? You
didn't want it before. And now you want it. Well, you can't have it. That's the way life
goes, Mr. Mandel!
Mandel nodded and left. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mandel</b></font>) presumed wrongly that Bankier had already lifted at least a
segment of the cash. In fact, however, Bankier was being careful. The money did finish
in the hands of Zionist prisoners in P@lasz@ow, for Alta Rubner's receipt for the funds
was delivered to Springmann by Sedlacek. It seems that the amount was used in part to
help Jews who came from other cities than Cracow and therefore had no local sources of
support.
Whether the funds that came to Oskar and were
passed on by him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) were spent mainly on food, as
Stern would have preferred, or largely on underground
resistance--the purchase of passes or weapons
--is a question Oskar never investigated. None of this money, however, went to buy Mrs.
Schindler out of Montelupich prison or to save the lives of such people as the Danziger
brothers. Nor was the Sedlacek money used to replace the 30,000-kilogram bribes of
enamelware
Oskar would pay out to major and minor SS officials during 1943 to prevent them from
recommending the closure of the Emalia camp. None of it was spent on the 16,000-z@l.
set of gynecological instruments Oskar had to buy on the black market when one of the
Emalia girls got pregnant--pregnancy being, of course, an immediate ticket to
Auschwitz. Nor did any of it go to purchase the broken-down Mercedes from
Untersturmf@uhrer John. John offered Oskar the Mercedes for sale at the same time as
Oskar presented a request for 30 P@lasz@ow people to be transferred to Emalia.
The car, bought by Oskar one day for 12,000
z@l., was requisitioned the next by Leo
John's friend and brother officer,
Untersturmf@uhrer Scheidt, to be used in the construction of fieldworks on the camp
perimeter. Perhaps they'll carry soil in the trunk, Oskar raged to Ingrid at the supper
table. In a later informal account of the incident, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) commented that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was glad to be of
assistance to both gentlemen.

<p/>CHAPTER 26
Raimund Titsch was making payments of a different order. Titsch was a quiet, clerkly
Austrian Catholic with a limp some said came from the first war and others from a
childhood accident.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was ten years or more older than either Amon
or Oskar. Inside the P@lasz@ow camp, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
managed Julius Madritsch's uniform
factory, a business of 3,000
seamstresses and mechanics.
One way he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) paid was through his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) chess matches with Amon Goeth. The Administration
Building was connected with the Madritsch works by telephone, and Amon would often
call Titsch up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) office for a game. The first time Raimund had played Amon, the
game had ended in half an hour and not in the Hauptsturmf@uhrer's favor.
Titsch, with the restrained and not so very triumphal <div class="bookquote">``Mate!''  (<font color='red'><b>Titsch/Raimund Titsch/Raimund</b></font>)</div>dying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) lips, had been
amazed at the tantrum Amon had thrown. The Commandant had grabbed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) coat and
gun belt, buttoning and buckling them on, ramming his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) cap on his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) head.
Raimund Titsch, appalled, believed that
Amon was about to go down to the trolley line looking for a prisoner to chastise for his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)--
for Raimund Titsch's--minor victory at chess. Since that first afternoon, Titsch had taken
a new direction. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) could take as long as three hours to lose to the Commandant.
When workers in the Administration Building saw Titsch limping up Jerozolimska to do
this chess duty, they knew the afternoon would be saner for it. A modest sense of security
spread from them down to the workshops and even to the miserable trolley pushers.
But Raimund Titsch did not only play
preventive chess. Independently of Dr.
Sedlacek and of the man with the pocket camera whom Oskar had brought to
P@lasz@ow, Titsch had begun photographing. Sometimes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) office window,
sometimes from the corners of workshops, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) photographed the stripe-uniformed
prisoners in the trolley line, the distribution of bread and soup, the digging of drains and
foundations. Some of these photographs of Titsch's are probably of the illegal supply of
bread to the Madritsch workshop. Certainly round brown loaves were bought by
Raimund himself, with Julius Madritsch's consent and money, and delivered to
P@lasz@ow by truck beneath bales of rags and bolts of cloth. Titsch photographed
round rye being hurried from hand to hand into Madritsch's storeroom, on the side away
from the towers and screened from the main access road by the bulk of the camp
stationery plant.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) photographed the SS and the Ukrainians
marching, at play, at work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) photographed
a work party under the supervision of engineer Karp,
who was soon to be set on by the killer dogs, his (<font color='blue'><b>killer</b></font>)
thigh ripped open, his (<font color='blue'><b>killer</b></font>) genitals torn
off. In a long shot of P@lasz@ow, he (<font color='blue'><b>killer</b></font>)
intimated the size of the camp, its desolation. It seems that on Amon's sun deck he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) even
took close-ups of the Commandant at rest in a deck chair, a hefty Amon approaching now
the 120 kg at which newly arrived SS Dr.
Blancke would say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Enough, Amon; you have to take some weight off.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Titsch
photographed Rolf and Ralf loping and sunning, and Majola holding one of the dogs by
the collar and pretending to enjoy it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Majola</b></font>) also took Amon in full majesty on his (<font color='blue'><b>Majola</b></font>) big white
horse.
As the reels were shot, Titsch did not have them developed. As an archive, they were
safer and more portable in roll form. He (<font color='blue'><b>Majola</b></font>) hid them in a steel box in his (<font color='blue'><b>Majola</b></font>) Cracow apartment.
There also he (<font color='blue'><b>Majola</b></font>) kept some of the remaining goods of the Madritsch Jews. Throughout
P@lasz@ow you found people who had a final treasure; something to offer--at the
moment of greatest danger--to the man with the list, the man who opened and closed the
doors on the cattle cars. Titsch understood that only the desperate deposited goods with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). That prison minority who had a stock of rings and watches and jewelry hidden
somewhere in P@lasz@ow didn't need him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). They traded regularly for favors and
comforts. But into the same hiding as Titsch's photographs went the final resources of a
dozen families--Auntie Yanka's brooch, Uncle Mordche's watch. In fact, when the
P@lasz@ow regimen passed, when Scherner and Czurda had fled, and when the
impeccable files of the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office had been baled up
in trucks and moved away as evidence, Titsch had no need to develop the photographs,
and every reason not to. In the files of ODESSA, the postwar secret society of former SS
men, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) would be listed as a traitor. For the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>)'d supplied the Madritsch people
with some 30,000 loaves of bread, as well as many chickens and some kilos of butter, and
that for his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) humanity he (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) had been honored by the Israeli Government, had received some
publicity in the press. Some people made threats and hissed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) passed in the
streets of Vienna. <div class="bookquote">``Jew-kisser.''  (<font color='red'><b>Titsch/Raimund Titsch/Raimund</b></font>)</div>So the P@lasz@ow reels would lie for twenty years in
the soil of a small park in the suburbs of Vienna where Titsch had buried them, and might
well have stayed there forever, the emulsion drying on the dark and secret images of
Amon's love Majola, his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) killing dogs, his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) nameless slave laborers. It might therefore have
been seen as a sort of triumph for the population of P@lasz@ow when, in November
1963, a Schindler survivor -LRB-leopold Pfefferberg-RRB- secretly bought the box and its contents
for $500 from Raimund Titsch, who was then suffering from terminal heart disease. Even
then, Raimund didn't want the rolls developed until after his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) death. The nameless shadow
of ODESSA frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) more than had the names of Amon Goeth, of Scherner, of
Auschwitz, in the days of P@lasz@ow.
After his (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) burial, the reels were developed.
Nearly all the pictures came out.
Not one of that small body of P@lasz@ow inmates who would survive Amon and the
camp itself would ever have anything accusatory to say of Raimund Titsch. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was
never the sort of man concerning whom mythologies arose. Oskar was. From late 1943,
there is a story about Schindler which runs among the survivors with the electric
excitement of a myth. For the thing about a myth is not whether it is true or not, nor
whether it should be true, but that it is somehow truer than truth itself. Through listening
to such stories, one can see that to the P@lasz@ow people, while Titsch may have been
the good hermit, Oskar had become a minor god of deliverance, double-faced--in the
Greek manner--as any small god; endowed with all the human vices; many-handed;
subtly powerful; capable of bringing gratuitous but secure salvation.
One story concerns the time when the SS police chiefs were under pressure to close
P@lasz@ow, as its reputation as an efficient industrial complex was not high with the
Armaments Inspectorate.
Helen Hirsch, Goeth's maid, often encountered
officers, dinner guests, who wandered into the
hallway or kitchen of the villa to escape
Amon for a while and to shake their heads. An
SS officer named Tibritsch, turning up in the
kitchen, had said to Helen, <div class="bookquote">``Doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) know
there are men giving their lives?''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen Hirsch/Helen</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) meant on the
Eastern Front, of course, not out there in the dark
of P@lasz@ow. Officers with less imperial
lives than Amon were becoming outraged by what they
saw at the villa or, perhaps more
dangerously, envious.
As the legend has it, it was on a Sunday
evening that General Julius Schindler himself visited P@lasz@ow to decide whether its
existence was of any real value to the war effort. It was an odd hour for a grand
bureaucrat to be visiting a plant, but perhaps the Armaments Inspectorate, in view of the
perilous winter now falling on the Eastern Front, were working desperate hours. The
inspection had been preceded by dinner at Emalia, at which wine and cognac flowed, for
Oskar is associated like Bacchus with the Dionysian line of gods. Because of the dinner,
the inspection party rolling out to P@lasz@ow in their Mercedeses were in a mood of
less than professional detachment. In making this claim, the story ignores the fact that
Schindler and his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) officers were all production experts and engineers with nearly four
years of detachment behind them. But Oscar would be the last to be awed by that fact.
The inspection started at the Madritsch clothing factory. This was P@lasz@ow's
showplace. During 1943, it had produced Wehrmacht uniforms at a monthly rate of
better than twenty thousand. But the question was whether Herr Madritsch would do
better to forget P@lasz@ow, to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) capital on expanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) more efficient and
better-supplied Polish factories in Podg@orze and Tarnow. The ramshackle conditions of
P@lasz@ow were no encouragement to Madritsch or any other investor to install the sort
of machinery a sophisticated factory would need.
The official party had just begun its inspection when all the lights in all the workshops
went out, the power circuit broken by friends of Itzhak Stern's in the P@lasz@ow
generator shed. To the handicaps of drink and indigestion which Oskar had imposed on
the gentlemen of the Armaments Inspectorate were now added the limitations of bad
light. The inspection went ahead by flashlight, in fact, and the machinery on the benches
remained inoperative and therefore less of a provocation to the inspectors' professional
feelings.
As General Schindler squinted along the beam of a flashlight at the presses and lathes in
the metalworks, 30,000 P@lasz@owians, restless in tiered bunks, waited on his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) word.
Even on the overladen lines of the
Ostbahn, they knew, the higher technology of Auschwitz was but a few hours' journey
west. They understood that they could not expect from General Schindler compassion as
such. Production was his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) specialty. For him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>), Production was meant to be an overriding
value.
Because of Schindler's dinner and the power failure, says the myth, the people of
P@lasz@ow were saved. It is a generous fable, because in fact only a tenth of
P@lasz@ow people would be alive at the end. But Stern and others would later celebrate
the story, and most of its details are probably true. For Oskar always had recourse to
liquor when puzzled as to how to treat officials, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would have liked the trickery of
plunging them into darkness. <div class="bookquote">``You have to remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>said a boy whom Oskar would
later save, <div class="bookquote">``that Oskar had a German side but a Czech side too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was the good soldier
Schweik. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) loved to foul up the system.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>It is ungracious to the myth to ask what the exacting Amon Goeth thought when the lights
went out. Maybe, even on the level of literal event, he (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) was drunk or dining elsewhere.
The question is whether P@lasz@ow survived because General Schindler was deceived
by dim light and alcohol-dimmed vision, or whether it continued because it was such an
excellent holding center for those weeks when the great terminus at Auschwitz-Birkenau
was overcrowded. But the story says more of people's expectations of Oskar than it does
of the frightful compound of P@lasz@ow or the final end of most of its inmates.
And while the SS and the Armaments
Inspectorate considered the future of
P@lasz@ow, Josef Bau--a young artist from Cracow, whom Oskar would in the end
come to know well--was falling into conspicuous and unconditional love with a girl
named Rebecca Tannenbaum. Bau worked in the Construction Office as a draftsman. He (<font color='blue'><b>draftsman</b></font>)
was a solemn boy with an artist's sense of destiny. He (<font color='blue'><b>draftsman</b></font>) had, so to speak, escaped into
P@lasz@ow, because he (<font color='blue'><b>draftsman</b></font>) had never held the correct ghetto papers. Since he (<font color='blue'><b>draftsman</b></font>) had had no
trade of use to the ghetto factories, he (<font color='blue'><b>draftsman</b></font>) had been hidden by his (<font color='blue'><b>draftsman</b></font>) mother and by friends.
During the liquidation in March 1943, he (<font color='blue'><b>draftsman</b></font>)'d escaped out of the walls and attached himself
to the tail of a labor detail going to P@lasz@ow. For in P@lasz@ow there was a new
industry which had had no place in the ghetto. Construction. In the same somber twowinged
building in which Amon had his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) office, Josef Bau worked on blueprints. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) was
a prot@eg`e of Itzhak Stern's, and Stern had mentioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) to Oskar as an accomplished
draftsman and as a boy who had, potentially at least, skills as a forger.
He (<font color='blue'><b>forger</b></font>) was lucky not to come into too much contact with Amon, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) displayed the air
of genuine sensibility which had, before today, caused Amon to reach for his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) revolver.
Bau's office was on the far side of the building from Amon's. Some prisoners worked on
the ground floor, with offices near the Commandant's. There were the purchasing
officers; the clerks; Mietek Pemper, the stenographer. They faced not only a daily risk of
an unexpected bullet but, more certainly than that, assaults on their sense of outrage.
Mundek Korn, for example, who had been a buyer for a string of Rothschild subsidiaries
before the war and who now bought the fabrics, sea grass, lumber, and iron for the prison
workshops, had to work not only in the Administration Building but in the same wing
where Amon had his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) office. One morning Korn looked up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Korn</b></font>) desk and saw through
the window, across Jerozolimska Street and by the SS barracks, a boy of twenty or so
years, a Cracovian of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) acquaintance, urinating against the base of one of the stacks of
lumber there. At the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw white-shirted arms and two ham fists appear
through the bathroom window at the end of the wing. The right hand held a revolver.
There were two quick shots, at least one of which entered the boy's head and drove him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
forward against the pile of cut wood. When Korn looked once more at the bathroom
window, one white-shirted arm and free hand were engaged in closing the window.
On Korn's desk that morning were requisition
forms signed with Amon's open-voweled but not
deranged scrawl. His (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) gaze ranged from the
signature to the unbuttoned corpse at the box
of lumber. Not only did he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had
seen what he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had seen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) sensed the
seductive concept inherent in Amon's
methods. That is, the temptation to agree that if murder was no more than a visit to the
bathroom, a mere pulse in the monotony of form signing, then perhaps all death should
now be accepted-- with whatever despair--as routine.
It does not seem that Josef Bau was exposed to such radical persuasion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) missed too
the purge of the administrative staff on the ground floor right and center. It had begun
when Josef Neuschel, Goeth's prot@eg`e, complained to the Commandant that a girl in
the office had acquired a rind of bacon. Amon had come raging down the corridor from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) office. <div class="bookquote">``You're all getting fat!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had screamed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had divided the office staff into
two lines then. It had been, to Korn, like a scene from the Podg@orze High School: the
girls in the other line so familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Korn</b></font>), daughters of families he (<font color='blue'><b>Korn</b></font>)'d grown up with,
Podg@orze families. It could have been that a teacher was sorting them out into those
who would visit the Kosciuszko Monument and those for the museum at the Wawel. In
fact, the girls in the other line were taken straight from their desks to Chujowa G@orka
and, for the decadence of that bacon rind, gunned down by one of Pilarzik's squads.
Though Josef Bau was not involved in such office turmoil, no one could have said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>)
was leading a sheltered life in P@lasz@ow. But it had been less perilous than the
experience of the girl of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) choice. Rebecca Tannenbaum was an orphan, though in the
clannish life of Jewish Cracow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>) had not been bereft of kindly aunts and uncles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>)
was nineteen, sweet-faced, and neatly built. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>) could speak German well and made
pleasant and generous conversation. Recently she (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>)'d begun to work in Stern's office
behind the Administration Building, away from the most immediate environs of the
Commandant's berserk interference. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>) job in the Construction Office was only half
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>) labor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>) was a manicurist. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>) treated Amon weekly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>) tended the hands of
Untersturmf@uhrer Leo John, those of Dr. Blancke and of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) lover, the harsh Alice
Orlowski. Taking Amon's hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>) had found them long and well made, with tapering
fingers--not a fat man's hands at all; certainly not those of a savage.
When a prisoner had first come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>) and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>)
that the Herr Commandant wanted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>) had
begun to run away, fleeing among the desks and
down the back stairs. The prisoner had followed
and cried after her (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``For God's sake,
don't! He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'ll punish me if I don't
bring you back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>) had followed the man down to Goeth's villa. But before going into the salon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tannenbaum</b></font>)
first visited the stinking cellar--this was in Goeth's first residence, and the cellar had
been dug down into the boundaries of an ancient Jewish graveyard. Down amid the
grave soil, Rebecca's friend Helen Hirsch had been nursing bruises. You have a problem,
Helen admitted. But just do the job and see. That's all you can do. Some people he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) likes a
professional manner from, some people he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) doesn't. And I'll give you cake and sausage
when you come. But don't just take food; ask me first. Some people take food without
asking, and I don't know what I have to cover up for.
Amon did accept Rebecca's professional manner, presenting his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) fingers and chatting in
German. It could have been the Hotel Cracovia again, and Amon a crisp-shirted,
overweight young German tycoon come to Cracow to sell textiles or steel or chemicals.
There were, however, two aspects to these meetings that detracted from their air of
timeless geniality. The Commandant always kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) service revolver at his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) right elbow,
and frequently one or the other of the dogs drowsed in the salon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) had seen them, on
the Appellplatz, tear the flesh of engineer Karp. Yet sometimes, as the dogs snuffled in
sleep and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) and Amon compared notes on prewar visits to the spa at Carlsbad, the rollcall
horrors seemed remote and beyond belief. One day she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) felt confident enough to ask
him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) why the revolver was always at his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) elbow. His (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) answer chilled the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) neck as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) bent over his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``That's in case you ever nick me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>).
If she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) ever needed proof that a chat about spas was all the same to Amon as an act of
madness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) had it the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) entered the hallway and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) dragging her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) friend
Helen Hirsch out of the salon by the hair--Helen striving to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) balance and her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
auburn hair coming out by the roots, and Amon, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) grip one second, regaining
it the next in his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) giant, well-tended hands. And further proof came on the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
entered the salon and one of those dogs--Rolf or Ralf-- materialized, leaped at her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), and,
holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) by the shoulders, opened its jaw on her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) breast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) looked across the room
and saw Amon lolling on the sofa and smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Stop shaking, you stupid girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``or I won't be able to save you from the hound.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>During the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) tended the Commandant's hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would shoot his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) shoeshine boy
for faulty work; hang his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) fifteen-year-old orderly, Poldek Deresiewicz, from the ringbolts
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) office because a flea had been found on one of the dogs; and execute his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) servant
Lisiek for lending a dr@o@zka and horse to Bosch without first checking. Yet twice a
week, the pretty orphan entered the salon and philosophically took the beast by the hand.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) met Josef Bau one gray morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) stood outside the Bauleitung holding up a
blueprint frame toward the low autumn cloud. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) thin body seemed overburdened by the
weight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) could help him (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm just waiting for the
sunshine.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) explained how his (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) transparency drawings for a new
building were clamped in the frame beside sensitized blueprint paper. If the sun, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) said,
were only to shine harder, a mysterious chemical union would transfer the drawing from
the transparency to the blueprint. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you be my magical
sunshine?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Pretty girls weren't used to delicacy from boys in P@lasz@ow. Sexuality there took its
harsh impetus from the volleys heard on Chujowa G@orka, the executions on the
Appellplatz. Imagine a day, for instance, when a chicken is found among the work party
returning from the cable factory on Wieliczka. Amon is ranting on the Appellplatz, for
the chicken was discovered lying in a bag in front of the camp gate during a spot check.
Whose bag was it? Amon wants to know. Whose chicken? Since no one on the
Appellplatz will admit anything, Amon takes a rifle from an SS man and shoots the
prisoner at the head of the line. The bullet, passing through the body, also fells the man
behind. No one speaks, though. <div class="bookquote">``How you love one another!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>roars Amon, and prepares
to execute the next man in line. A boy of fourteen steps out of the line. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is shuddering
and weeping. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can say who brought the chicken in, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tells the Herr Commandant.
<div class="bookquote">``Who, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div>The boy points to one of the two dead men. <div class="bookquote">``That one!''  (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div>the boy screams.
Amon astonishes the entire Appellplatz by believing the boy, and puts his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) head back and
laughs with the sort of classroom incredulity teachers like to exhibit. These people ...
can't they understand now why they're all forfeit?
After an evening like that, in the hours of free movement between 7 and 9 P.m. most
prisoners felt that there was no time for leisurely courtship. The lice plaguing your groin
and armpits made a mockery of formality. Young males mounted girls without ceremony.
In the women's camp they sang a song which asked the virgin why she (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>)'d bound herself
up with string and for whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) was saving herself. The atmosphere was
not as desperate at Emalia. In the enamel workshop, niches had been designed among the
machinery on the factory floor to permit lovers to meet at greater length. There was only
a theoretical segregation in the cramped barracks. The absence of daily fear, the fuller
ration of daily bread made for a little less frenzy. Besides, Oskar still maintained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
would not let the SS garrison go inside the prison without his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) permission.
One prisoner recalls wiring installed in
Oskar's office in case any SS official
did demand entry to the barracks. While the SS man was on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way downstairs, Oskar
could punch a button connected to a bell inside the camp. It warned men and women,
first, to stub out the illicit cigarettes supplied daily by Oskar. -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Go to my apartment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
would tell someone on the factory floor almost daily, <div class="bookquote">``and fill this cigarette case.''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
would wink significantly.-RRB- The bell also warned men and women to get back to their
appointed bunks. To Rebecca, it was something close to a shock, a remembrance of a
vanished culture, to meet in P@lasz@ow a boy who courted as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d met her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) in a
patisserie in the Rynek.
Another morning when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) came downstairs from Stern's office, Josef showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>)
work desk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) was drawing plans for yet more barracks. What's your barrack number,
and who's your barrack Alteste? She (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) know with the correct reluctance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) had
seen Helen Hirsch dragged down the hallway by the hair and would die if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>)
accidentally jabbed the cuticle of Amon's thumb. Yet this boy had restored her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) to
coyness, to girlhood. I'll come and speak to your mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) promised. I don't have a
mother, said Rebecca. Then I'll speak to the Alteste.
That was how the courting began--with the permission of elders and as if there were
world enough and time. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was such a fantastical and ceremonious boy, they did
not kiss. It was, in fact, under Amon's roof that they first managed a proper embrace. It
was after a manicure session. Rebecca had got hot water and soap from Helen and crept
up to the top floor, vacant because of renovations pending, to wash her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) blouse and her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
change of underwear. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) washtub was her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) mess can. It would be needed tomorrow to
hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) soup.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was working away on that small bucket of suds when Josef appeared. Why are you
here? she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>). I'm measuring for my drawings, for the renovations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>).
And why are you here yourself? You can see, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>). And please don't talk too
loudly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) danced around the room, flashing the tape measure up walls and along moldings. Do
it carefully, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>), anxious because she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was aware of Amon's exacting standards.
While I'm here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), I might as well measure you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) ran the tape along her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) arms
and down her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) back from the nape of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) neck to the small of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) spine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) did not resist
the way his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) thumb touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), marking her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) dimensions. But when they had embraced
each other thoroughly for a while, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) out. This was no place for a
languorous afternoon.
There were other desperate romances in P@lasz@ow, even among the SS, but they
proceeded less sunnily than this very proper romance between Josef Bau and the
manicurist. Oberscharf@uhrer Albert Hujar, for example, who had shot Dr. Rosalia Blau
in the ghetto and Diana Reiter after the foundations of the barracks collapsed, had fallen
in love with a Jewish prisoner. Madritsch's daughter had been captivated by a Jewish boy
from the Tarnow ghetto--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had, of course, worked in Madritsch's Tarnow plant until
the expert ghetto-liquidator Amon had been brought in at the end of the summer to close
down Tarnow as he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had Cracow. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was in the Madritsch workshop inside
P@lasz@ow; the girl could visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) there. But nothing could come of it. The prisoners
themselves had niches and shelters where lovers and spouses could meet. But
everything--the law of the Reich and the strange code of the prisoners--resisted the
affair between Fraulein Madritsch and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) young man.
Similarly, honest Raimund Titsch had
fallen in love with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) machinists. That too
was a gentle, secretive, and largely
abortive love. As for Oberscharf@uhrer
Hujar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hujar</b></font>) was ordered by Amon himself to stop being a fool. So Albert took the girl for a
walk in the woods and with fondest regrets shot her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) through the nape of the neck.
It seemed, in fact, that death hung over the
passions of the SS. Henry Rosner, the
violinist, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) brother Leopold, the
accordionist, spreading Viennese melodies
around Goeth's dinner table, were aware of it. One
night a tall, slim, gray officer in the
Waffen SS had visited Amon for dinner
and, drinking a lot, had kept asking the Rosners for the Hungarian song <div class="bookquote">``Gloomy
Sunday.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>The song is an emotional outpouring in which a young man is about to commit
suicide for love. It had exactly the sort of excessive feeling which, Henry had noticed,
appealed to SS men at their leisure. It had, in fact, enjoyed notoriety in the Thirties--
governments in Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia had considered banning it because
its popularity had brought on a rash of thwarted-love suicides. Young men about to blow
their heads off would sometimes quote its lyrics in their suicide notes. It had long been a
song proscribed by the Reich Propaganda Office. Now this tall, elegant guest, old enough
to have teen-age sons and daughters, themselves caught up in the excesses of puppy love,
kept walking up to the Rosner boys and saying, ``Play ``Gloomy Sunday.'''' And though
Dr. Goebbels would not have permitted it, no one in the wilds of southern Poland was
going to argue with an SS field officer with unhappy memories of an affair.
After the guest had demanded the song four or five times, an unearthly conviction took
hold of Henry Rosner. In its tribal origins, music was always magic. And no one in
Europe had a better sense of the potency of the violin than a Cracovian Jew like Henry,
who came from the sort of family in which music is not so much learned as inherited, in
the same way as the status of cohen, or hereditary priest. It came to Henry now that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
would say later--
<div class="bookquote">``God, if I have the power, maybe this
son-of-a-bitch will kill himself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The proscribed music of <div class="bookquote">``Gloomy
Sunday''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>had gained legitimacy in Amon's dining room through being repeated, and now
Henry declared war with it, Leopold playing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Leopold</b></font>) and reassured by the stares of
almost grateful melancholy the handsome officer directed at them.
Henry sweated, believing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was so visibly
fiddling up the SS man's death that at any
moment Amon would notice and come and take him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) out
behind the villa for execution. As for Henry's
performance, it is not relevant to ask was it good or
bad. It was possessed. And only one man, the
officer, noticed and assented and, across the hubbub
of drunken Bosch and Scherner, Czurda and
Amon, continued to look up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) chair
directly into Henry's eyes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) were going
to jump up at any second and say, <div class="bookquote">``Of
course, gentlemen. The violinist is
absolutely right. There's no sense in enduring a grief like this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The Rosners went on repeating the song beyond the limit at which Amon would normally
have shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>At last the guest stood up and went out onto the balcony. Henry
knew at once that everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could do to the man had been done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) brother
slid into some Von Supp`e and Lehar, covering their tracks with full-bodied operetta. The
guest remained alone on the balcony and after half an hour interrupted a good party by
shooting himself through the head.
Such was sex in P@lasz@ow. Lice,
crabs, and urgency inside the wire; murder and
lunacy on its fringes. And in its midst
Josef Bau and Rebecca Tannenbaum
pursued their ritual dance of courtship.
In the midst of the snows that year, P@lasz@ow
underwent a change of status adverse to all
lovers inside the wire. In the early days of
January 1944, it was designated a
Konzentrationslager -LRB-concentration Camp-RRB-
under the central authority of General Oswald
Pohl's SS Main Economic and
Administrative Office in Oranienburg, on
the outskirts of Berlin. Subcamps of
P@lasz@ow--such as Oskar Schindler's
Emalia--now also came under
Oranienburg's control. Police chiefs
Scherner and Czurda lost their direct
authority. The labor fees of all those
prisoners employed by Oskar and Madritsch no longer went to Pomorska Street, but to
the office of General Richard Gl@ucks, head of Pohl's Section D -LRB-concentration
Camps-RRB-. Oskar, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wanted favors now, had not only to drive out to P@lasz@ow and
sweeten Amon, not only to have Julian Scherner to dinner, but also to reach certain
officials in the grand bureaucratic complex of Oranienburg.
Oskar made an early opportunity
to travel to Berlin and meet the people who would be dealing
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) files. Oranienburg had begun as a
concentration camp. Now it had become a sprawl
of administrative barracks. From the offices of
Section D, every aspect of prison life and
death was regulated. Its chief, Richard
Gl@ucks, had responsibility as well, in
consultation with Pohl, for establishing the balance between laborers and candidates for
the chambers, for the equation in which X represented slave labor and y represented the
more immediately condemned. Gl@ucks had laid down procedures for every event, and
from his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) department came memos drafted in the anesthetic jargon of the planner, the
paper shuffler, the detached specialist.

In this eerie chancellory, some files discussed the length a prisoner's hair should be
before it was considered of economic use for <div class="bookquote">``the manufacture of hair-yarn socks for Uboat
crews and hair-felt footwear for the Reichs railway,''  (<font color='red'><b>a prisoner</b></font>)</div>while others debated whether
the form registering <div class="bookquote">``death cases''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>should be filed by eight departments or merely covered
by letter and appended to the personnel records as soon as the index card had been
brought up to date. And here Herr Oskar Schindler of Cracow came to talk about his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) little
industrial compound in Zablocie. They appointed someone of middle status to handle
him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>), a personnel officer of field rank.
Oskar wasn't distressed. There were larger employers of Jewish prison labor than he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>).
There were the megaliths, Krupp, of course, and I. G. Farben. There was the Cable
Works at P@lasz@ow. Walter C. Toebbens, the Warsaw industrialist whom Himmler
had tried to force into the Wehrmacht, was a heavier employer of labor than Herr
Schindler. Then there were the steelworks at Stalowa Wola, the aircraft factories at
Budzyn and Zakopane, the Steyour-Daimler-Puch works at Radom.
The personnel officer had the plans of
Emalia on his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) desk. I hope, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) said
curtly, you don't want to increase the size of your camp. It would be impossible to do it
without courting a typhus epidemic.
Oskar waved that suggestion aside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was interested in the permanence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) labor
force, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had had a talk on that matter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) told the officer, with a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>),
Colonel Erich Lange. The name, Oskar could tell, meant something to the SS man. Oskar
produced a letter from the Colonel, and the personnel officer sat back reading it. The
office was silent--all you could hear from other rooms was pen-scratch and the whisper
of papers and quiet, earnest talk, as if none here knew that they lay at the core of a
network of screams.
Colonel Lange was a man of
influence, Chief of Staff of the Armaments
Inspectorate at Army Headquarters,
Berlin. Oskar had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) at a party at
General Schindler's office in Cracow. They had liked each other almost at once. It
happened a lot at parties that two people could sense in each other a certain resistance to
the regime and might retire to a corner to test each other out and perhaps establish
friendship. Erich Lange had been appalled by the factory camps of Poland--by the I. G.
Farben works at Buna, for example, where foremen adopted the SS <div class="bookquote">``work tempo''  (<font color='red'><b>foremen</b></font>)</div>and
made prisoners unload cement on the run; where the corpses of the starved, the broken
were hurled into ditches built for cables and covered, together with the cables, with
cement. <div class="bookquote">``You are not here to live but to perish in concrete,''  (<font color='red'><b>a plant manager</b></font>)</div>a plant manager had told
newcomers, and Lange had heard the speech and felt damned.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Lange</b></font>) letter to Oranienburg had been preceded by some phone calls, and calls and letter
both promoted the same proposition: Herr Schindler, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) mess kits and his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) 45mm
antitank shells, is considered by this Inspectorate to be a major contributor to the struggle
for our national survival. He (<font color='blue'><b>contributor</b></font>) has built up a staff of skilled specialists, and nothing should
be done to disrupt the work they perform under the Herr Direktor Schindler's
supervision.
The personnel officer was impressed and said he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) would speak frankly to Herr Schindler.
There were no plans to alter the status or interfere with the population of the camp in
Zablocie. However, the Herr Direktor had to understand that the situation of Jews, even
skilled armaments workers, was always risky. Take the case of our own SS enterprises.
Ostindustrie, the SS company, employs prisoners in a peat works, a brush factory and
iron foundry in Lublin, equipment factories in Radom, a fur works in Trawniki. But other
branches of the SS shoot the work force continually, and now Osti is for all practical
purposes out of business.
Likewise, at the killing centers, the staff
never retains a sufficient percentage of
prisoners for factory work. This has been a matter of frequent correspondence, but
they're intransigent, those people in the field. <div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>personnel</b></font>)</div>said the personnel officer,
tapping the letter, <div class="bookquote">``I'll do what I can for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the personnel officer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I understand the problem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar, looking up at the SS man with that radiant smile.
<div class="bookquote">``If there is any way I can express my
gratitude ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>In the end, Oskar left Oranienburg with at least some guarantees about the continuity of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) backyard camp in Cracow.
The manner in which the new status of
P@lasz@ow impinged on lovers was that a proper penal separation of the sexes--such as
was provided for in a series of SS Main Office of Economics and Administration
memos--was created. The fences between the men's prison and the women's, the
perimeter fence, the fence around the industrial sector were all electrified. The voltage,
the spacing of wires, the number of electrified strands and insulators were all provided
for by Main Office directives.
Amon and his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) officers were not slow to notice the disciplinary possibilities involved.
Now you could stand people for twenty-four hours at a time between the electrified outer
fence and the inner, neutral, original fence. If they staggered with weariness, they knew
that inches behind their backs ran the hundreds of volts. Mundek Korn, for example,
found himself, on returning to camp with a work party from which one prisoner was
missing, standing in that narrow gulf for a day and a night.
But perhaps worse than the risk of falling against the wire was the way the current ran,
from the end of evening roll call to reveille in the morning, like a moat between man and
woman. Time for contact was now reduced to the short phase of milling on the
Appellplatz, before the orders for falling into line were shouted. Each couple devised a
tune, whistling it among the crowds, straining to pick up the answering refrain amid a
forest of sibilance. Rebecca Tannenbaum also settled on a code tune. The requirements of
General Pohl's Main SS Office had forced the prisoners of P@lasz@ow to adopt the
mating stratagems of birds. And by these means, the formal romance of Rebecca and
Josef went forward.
Then Josef somehow got a dead woman's
dress from the clothing warehouse. Often, after roll
call in the men's lines, he (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) would go to the
latrines, put on the long gown, and place an
Orthodox bonnet on his (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) hair. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) would
come out and join the women's lines. His (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>)
short hair would not have amazed any SS guard,
since most of the women had been shorn because of
lice. So, with 13,000 women prisoners, he (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>)
would pass into the women's compound and spend the night
sitting up in Hut 57 keeping Rebecca
company.
In Rebecca's barracks, the older women
took Josef at his (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) word. If Josef
required a traditional courtship, they would fall into their traditional roles as chaperones.
Josef was therefore a gift to them too, a license to play their prewar ceremonious selves.
From their four-tiered bunks they looked down on the two children until everyone fell
asleep. If any one of them thought, Let's not be too fussy in times like these about what
the children get up to in the dead of night, it was never said. In fact, two of the older
women would crowd onto one narrow ledge so that Josef could have a bunk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) own.
The discomfort, the smell of the other body, the risk of the migration of lice from your
friend to yourself--none of that was as important, as crucial to self-respect as that the
courtship should be fulfilled according to the norms. At the end of winter, Josef, wearing
the armband of the Construction Office, went out into the strangely immaculate snow in
the strip between the inner fence and the electrified barrier and, steel measure in hand,
under the eyes of the domed watchtowers, pretended to be sizing up no-man's-land for
some architectural reason.
At the base of the concrete stanchions studded with porcelain insulators grew the first
tiny flowers of that year. Flashing his (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) steel ruler, he (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) picked them and shoved them into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) jacket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) brought the flowers across the camp, up Jerozolimska Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) was
passing Amon's villa, his (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) chest stuffed with blossoms, when Amon himself appeared
from the front door and advanced, towering, down the steps. Josef Bau stopped. It was
most dangerous to stop, to appear to be in arrested motion in front of Amon. But having
stopped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) seemed frozen there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) feared that the heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)'d so energetically and
honestly signed over to the orphan Rebecca would likely now become just another of
Amon's targets.
But when Amon walked past him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>), not noticing him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>), not objecting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) standing there
with an idle ruler in his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) hands, Josef Bau concluded that it meant some kind of guarantee.
No one escaped Amon unless it was a sort of destiny.
All dolled up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) shooting uniform, Amon had entered the camp unexpectedly one day
through the back gate and had found the Warrenhaupt girl lolling in a limousine at the
garage, staring at herself in the rearview mirror. The car windows she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d been assigned to
clean were still smudged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had killed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for that. And there was that mother and
daughter Amon had noticed through a kitchen window. They had been peeling potatoes
too slowly. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)'d leaned in on the sill and shot both of them. Yet here at his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) steps was
something he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) hated, a stock-still Jewish lover and draftsman, steel ruler dangling in his (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>)
hands. And Amon had walked by. Bau felt the urge to confirm this outrageous good luck
by some emphatic act. Marriage was, of course, the most emphatic act of all.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) got back to the Administration Building, climbed the stairs to Stern's office and,
finding Rebecca, asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>). Urgency, Rebecca was pleased and concerned
to notice, had entered the business now.
That evening, in the dead woman's dress, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) visited his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) mother again and the council of
chaperones in Hut 57. They awaited only the arrival of a rabbi. But if rabbis came, they
remained only a few days on their way to Auschwitz--not long enough for people
requiring the rites of kiddushin and nissuin to locate them and ask them, before they
stepped into the furnace, for a final exercise of their priesthood.
Josef married Rebecca on a Sunday night of fierce cold in February. There was no rabbi.
Mrs. Bau, Josef's mother, officiated. They were Reformed Jews, so that they could do
without a ketubbah written in Aramaic. In the workshop of Wulkan the jeweler someone
had made up two rings out of a silver spoon Mrs. Bau had had hidden in the rafters. On
the barracks floor, Rebecca circled Josef seven times and Josef crushed glass--a spent
light bulb from the Construction Office--beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) heel.
The couple had been given the top bunk of the tier. For the sake of privacy, it had been
hung with blankets. In darkness Josef and Rebecca climbed to it, and all around them the
earthy jokes were running. At weddings in Poland there was always a period of truce
when profane love was given its chance to speak. If the wedding guests didn't wish to
voice the traditional double entendres themselves, they could bring in a professional
wedding jester. Women who might in the Twenties and Thirties have sat up at weddings
making disapproving faces at the risqu`e hired jester and the belly-laughing men, only
now and then permitting themselves, as mature women, to be overcome with amusement,
stepped tonight into the place of all the absent and dead wedding jesters of southern
Poland.
Josef and Rebecca had not been together more than ten minutes on the upper bunk when
the barracks lights came on. Looking through the blankets, Josef saw Untersturmf@uhrer
Scheidt patrolling the canyons of bunks. The same old fearful sense of destiny overcame
Josef. They'd found he (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) was missing from his (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) barracks, of course, and sent one of the
worst of the officers to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) mother's hut. Amon had been blinded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
that day outside the villa only so that Scheidt, who was quick on the trigger, could come
and kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) wedding night!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) knew too that all the women were compromised
--his (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) mother, his (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) bride, the witnesses, the ones who'd uttered the most exquisitely
embarrassing jokes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) began murmuring apologies, pleas to be forgiven. Rebecca told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) to be quiet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) took down the screen of blankets. At this time of night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) reasoned,
Scheidt wasn't going to climb to a top bunk unless provoked. The women on the lower
bunks were passing their small straw-filled pillows to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>). Josef might well have
orchestrated the courtship, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) was now the child to be concealed. Rebecca pushed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) hard up into the corner of the bunk and covered him (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) with pillows. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) watched
Scheidt pass below her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>), leave the barracks by its back door. The lights went out. Among
a last spatter of dark, earthy jokes, the Baus were restored to their privacy.
Within minutes, the sirens began to sound. Everyone sat up in the darkness. The noise
meant to Bau that yes, they were determined to stamp out this ritual marriage. They had
found his (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) empty bunk over in the men's quarters and were now seriously hunting him (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>).
In the dark aisle, the women were milling. They knew it too. From the top bunk he (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) could
hear them saying it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) old-fashioned love would kill them all. The barracks Alteste,
who'd been so decent about the whole thing, would be shot first once the lights came on
and they found a bridegroom there in token female rags.
Josef Bau grabbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) clothes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) wife perfunctorily, slid to the floor, and ran
from the hut. In the darkness outside, the wail of the sirens pierced him (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) ran in dirty
snow, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) jacket and old dress bundled up under his (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) armpits. When the lights came
on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) would be seen by the towers. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) had the berserk idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) could beat the
lights over the fence, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) could even climb it between the alternations of its current.
Once back in the men's camp, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) could make up some story about diarrhea, about having
gone to the latrines and collapsed on the floor, being brought back to consciousness by
the noise of sirens.
But even if electrocuted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) understood as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) sprinted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) could not then confess what
woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) was visiting. Racing for the fatal wire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) did not understand that there would
have to be a classroomlike scene on the Appellplatz and that Rebecca would be made,
one way or another, to step forward.
In the fence between the men's and women's camps in P@lasz@ow ran nine electrified
strands. Josef Bau launched himself high, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) feet would find purchase on the
third of the strands and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) hands, at the stretch, might reach the second from the top. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>)
imagined himself then as racing over the strands with a ratlike quickness. In fact he (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>)
landed in the mesh of wire and simply hung there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) thought the coldness of the metal in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) hands was the first message of the current. But there was no current.
There were no lights. Josef Bau, stretched on
the fence, did not speculate on the reason there
wasn't any voltage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>) got to the top and
vaulted into the men's camp. You're a married
man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slid into the
latrines by the washhouses. <div class="bookquote">``A frightful
diarrhea. Herr Oberscharf@uhrer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood gasping in the stench. Amon's blindness on the day of the flowers ... the
consummation, waited forwith an untoward patience, twice interrupted ... Scheidt and the
sirens ... a problem with the lights and the wire--staggering and gagging, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) wondered if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) could support the ambiguity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) life. Like others, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) wanted a more definite rescue.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) wandered out to be one of the last to join the lines in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) hut. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) was
trembling, but sure the Alteste would cover up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Herr Untersturmf@uhrer, I
gave H@aftling Bau permission to visit the latrines.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>They weren't looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Scheidt</b></font>) at all. They were looking for three young Zionists who'd
escaped in a truckload of product from the upholstery works, where they made
Wehrmacht mattresses out of sea grass.

<p/>CHAPTER 27
On April 28, 1944, Oskar--by looking sideways at himself in a mirror--was able to tell
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) waist had thickened for his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) thirty-sixth birthday. But at least today, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
embraced the girls, no one bothered to denounce him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). Any informer among the German
technicians must have been demoralized, since the SS had let Oskar out of Pomorska and
Montelupich, both of them centers supposed impregnable to influence.
To mark the day, Emilie sent the usual greetings from Czechoslovakia, and Ingrid and
Klonowska gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) gifts. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) domestic arrangements had scarcely changed in the four
and a half years he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had spent in Cracow. Ingrid was still a consort, Klonowska a
girlfriend, Emilie an understandably absent wife. Whatever grievances and bewilderment
each suffered goes unrecorded, but it would become obvious in this, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) thirty-seventh,
year that some coolness had entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) relations with Ingrid; that Klonowska, always a
loyal friend, was content with a merely sporadic liaison; and that Emilie still considered
their marriage indissoluble. For the moment, they gave their presents and kept their
counsel.
Others took a hand in the celebration. Amon permitted Henry Rosner to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) violin
to Lipowa Street in the evening under the guard of the best baritone in the Ukrainian
garrison.
Amon was, at this stage, very pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) association with Schindler. In return for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) continuing support for the Emalia camp, Amon had one day recently requested and
got the permanent use of Oskar's Mercedes--not the jalopy Oskar had bought from John
for a day, but the most elegant car in the Emalia garage.
The recital took place in Oskar's
office. No one attended except
Oskar. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) were tired of company.
When the Ukrainian went to the lavatory, Oskar
revealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) depression to Henry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was upset
about the war news. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) birthday had come in a
hiatus. The Russian armies had halted behind
the Pripet Marshes in Belorussia and in
front of Lw@ow. Oskar's fears puzzled
Henry. Doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) understand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wondered, that if the Russians aren't held off, it's the
end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) operation here?
<div class="bookquote">``I've often asked Amon to let you come here permanently,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar told Rosner. <div class="bookquote">``You and
your wife and child. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) won't hear of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) appreciates you too much. But eventually ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Rosner/Henry Rosner</b></font>)</div>Henry was grateful. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had to point out that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) family might be as safe as any
in P@lasz@ow. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) sister-in-law, for example, had been discovered by Goeth smoking at
work, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) execution. But one of the NCO'S had begged to put before
the Herr Commandant's notice the fact that this woman was Mrs. Rosner, wife of Rosner
the accordionist. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>Amon had said, pardoning her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Well, remember, girl, I won't
have smoking on the job.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Rosner/Henry Rosner</b></font>)</div>Henry told Oskar that night that it had been this attitude of Amon's--that the Rosners
were immune because of their musical talent--which had persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) and Manci to
bring their eight-year-old son, Olek, into the camp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Olek</b></font>) had been hiding with friends in
Cracow, but that was becoming a less and less secure business every day. Once inside,
Olek could blend into that small crowd of children, many unregistered in the prison
records, whose presence in P@lasz@ow was connived at by prisoners and tolerated by
some of the junior camp officials. Getting Olek into the place, however, had been the
risky part.
Poldek Pfefferberg, who'd had to drive a truck to town to pick up toolboxes, had
smuggled the boy in. The Ukrainians had nearly discovered him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) at the gate, while he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was
still an outsider and living in contravention of every racial statute of the Reich
Government General. His (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) feet had burst out of the end of the box that lay between
Pfefferberg's ankles. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Pfefferberg, Mr. Pfefferberg,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Ukrainians</b></font>)</div>Poldek had heard while the
Ukrainians searched the back of the truck. <div class="bookquote">``My feet are sticking out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Rosner/Henry Rosner</b></font>)</div>Henry could laugh at that now, though warily, since there were still rivers to be crossed.
But Schindler reacted dramatically, with a gesture that seemed to grow from the slightly
alcoholic melancholy which had beset him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) on this evening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) birthday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
office chair by its back and raised it to the portrait of the F@uhrer. It seemed for a second
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was about to lash into the icon. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) spun again on his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) heel, lowered the chair
deliberately until its four legs hung equidistant from the floor, and rammed them into the
carpet, shaking the wall. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``They're burning bodies out there, aren't they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Henry grimaced as if the stench were in the room.
<div class="bookquote">``They've started,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) admitted.
Now that P@lasz@ow was--in the language
of the bureaucrats--a Concentration Camp, its
inmates found that it was safer to encounter Amon. The
chiefs in Oranienburg did not permit summary
execution. The days when slow potato-peelers
could be expunged on the spot were gone. They could
now be destroyed only by due process. There had
to be a hearing, a record sent in triplicate
to Oranienburg. The sentence had to be confirmed not
only by General Gl@ucks's office but also
by General Pohl's Department W -LRB-economic
Enterprises-RRB-. For if a commandant killed
essential workers, Department W could find itself
hit with claims for compensation. Allach-Munich,
Ltd., for example, porcelain
manufacturers using slave labor from Dachau,
had recently filed a claim for 31,800
RM. because <div class="bookquote">``as a result of the typhoid
epidemic which broke out in January 1943, we
had no prison labor at our disposal from
January 26, 1943, until March 3,
1943. In our opinion we are entitled
to compensation under Clause 2 of the Businesses Compensation Settlement Fund ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>a SS officer</b></font>)</div>Department W was all the more liable for compensation if the loss of skilled labor arose
from the zeal of a trigger-happy SS officer.
So, to avoid the paperwork and the departmental complications, Amon held his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) hand on
most days.
The people who appeared within his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) range in the spring and
early summer of `44 somehow understood it was
safer, though they knew nothing of Department W and
Generals Pohl and Gl@ucks. It was to them a
remission as mysterious as Amon's
madness itself.
Yet, as Oskar had mentioned to Henry
Rosner, they were now burning bodies at P@lasz@ow. In preparation for the Russian
offensive, the SS was abolishing its institutions in the East. Treblinka, Sobibor, and
Bel@zec had been evacuated the previous autumn. The Waffen SS who had run them had
been ordered to dynamite the chambers and the crematoria, to leave no recognizable
trace, and had then been posted to Italy to fight partisans. The immense complex at
Auschwitz, in its safe ground in Upper Silesia, would complete the great task in the East,
and once that was concluded, the crematoria would be plowed under the earth. For
without the evidence of the crematoria, the dead could offer no witness, were a whisper
behind the wind, an inconsequential dust on the aspen leaves.
P@lasz@ow was not as simple a case, for its dead lay everywhere around it. In the
enthusiasm of the spring of 1943, bodies--notably the bodies of those killed in the
ghetto's last two days-- were thrown randomly into mass graves in the woods. Now
Department D charged Amon with finding them all.
Estimates of the numbers of bodies vary widely. Polish publications, based on the work
of the Main Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes in Poland and on other
sources, claim that 150,000 prisoners, many of them in transit to other places, went
through P@lasz@ow and its five subcamps. Of these, the Poles believe that 80,000 died
there, mainly in mass executions inside Chujowa G@orka or else in epidemics.
These figures baffle the surviving
P@lasz@ow inmates who remember the fearsome work of burning the dead. They say
the number they exhumed was somewhere between 8,000 and 10,000--1 multitude
frightful in itself and which they have no desire to exaggerate. The distance between the
two estimates looks narrower when it is remembered that executions of Poles, Gypsies,
and Jews would continue at Chujowa G@orka and at other points around P@lasz@ow
throughout most of that year, and that the SS themselves took up the practice of burning
bodies immediately after mass killings in the Austrian hill fort. Besides, Amon would not
succeed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) intention of removing all bodies from the woods. Some thousands more
would be found in postwar exhumations, and today, as the suburbs of Cracow close
P@lasz@ow in, bones are still discovered during the digging of foundations. Oskar saw
the line of pyres on the ridge above the workshops during a visit just before his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) birthday.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) came back a week later, the activity had increased. The bodies were dug up by
male prisoners who worked masked and gagging. On blankets and barrows and litters the
dead were brought to the burning site and laid on log frames. So the pyre was built, layer
by layer, and when it reached the height of a man's shoulder, was doused in fuel and lit.
Pfefferberg was horrified to see the temporary life the flames gave to the dead, the way
the corpses sat forward, throwing the burning logs away, their limbs reaching, their
mouths opening for a last cry. A young SS man from the delousing station ran among the
pyres waving a pistol and roaring frenetic orders. The dust of the dead fell in hair and on
the clothing hung in the back gardens of junior officers' villas. Oskar was bemused to see
the way the personnel took the smoke as if the grit in the air were some sort of honest and
inevitable industrial fallout. And through the fogs, Amon went riding with Majola, both
of them calm in the saddle. Leo John took his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) twelve-year-old son off to catch tadpoles in
the marshy ground in the wood. The flames and the stench did not distract them from
their daily lives.
Oskar, leaning back in the driver's seat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
BMW, the windows up and a handkerchief clamped
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) mouth and nose, thought how they must be burning
the Spiras with all the rest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d been astounded
when they'd executed all the ghetto policemen and
their families last Christmas, as soon as
Symche Spira had finished directing the
dismantling of the ghetto. They had brought them all, and their wives and children, up
here on a gray afternoon and shot them as the cold sun vanished. They'd shot the most
faithful -LRB-spira and Zellinger-RRB- as well as the most grudging. Spira and bashful Mrs. Spira
and the ungifted Spira children whom Pfefferberg had patiently tutored--they'd all stood
naked within a circle of rifles, shivering against each other's flanks, Spira's Napoleonic
OD uniform now just a heap of clothing for recycling, flung down at the fort entrance.
And Spira still assuring everyone that it could not happen.
That execution had shocked Oskar because it showed that there was no obedience or
obeisance a Jew could make to guarantee survival. And now they were burning the Spiras
as anonymously, as ungratefully, as they had executed them. Even the Gutters! It had
happened after a dinner at Amon's the year before. Oskar had gone home early, but later
heard what had happened after he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) left. John and Neuschel had started in on Bosch. They
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was squeamish. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'d made a fuss about being a veteran of the trenches. But
they had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) perform any executions.
They kept it going for hours--the joke of the evening. In the end, Bosch had ordered
David Gutter and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) son roused in their barracks and Mrs. Gutter and the Gutter girl
fetched from theirs.
Again, it was a matter of faithful servants.
David Gutter had been the last president of the
Judenrat and had cooperated in everything--had
never gone to Pomorska Street and tried to start
any argument over the scope of the SS
Aktions or the size of transports sent
to Bel@zec. Gutter had signed everything and thought every demand reasonable. Besides
that, Bosch had used Gutter as an agent inside and outside P@lasz@ow, sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) up
to Cracow with truckloads of newly upholstered furniture or pocketfuls of jewelry to sell
on the black market. And Gutter had done it because he (<font color='blue'><b>Gutter</b></font>) was a scoundrel anyhow, but
mainly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Gutter</b></font>) believed it would make his (<font color='blue'><b>Gutter</b></font>) wife and children immune. At two o'clock
that polar morning, a Jewish policeman, Zauder, a friend of Pfefferberg's and of Stern's,
later to be shot by Pilarzik during one of that officer's drunken rampages, but on duty at
the women's gate that night, heard it--Bosch ordering the Gutters into position in a
depression in the ground near the women's camp. The children pleading, but David and
Mrs. Gutter taking it calmly, knowing there was no argument. And now as Oskar
watched, all of that evidence--the Gutters, the Spiras, the rebels, the priests, the children,
the pretty girls found on Aryan papers--all of it was returning to that mad hill to be
obliterated in case the Russians came to P@lasz@ow and made too much of it. Care,
said Oranienburg in a letter to Amon, is to be taken with the future disposal of all bodies,
and for that purpose they were sending a representative of a Hamburg engineering firm to
survey the site for crematoria. In the meantime, the dead were to be kept, awaiting
retrieval, at well-marked burial sites.
When, on that second visit, Oskar saw the extent of the fires on Chujowa G@orka, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
first impulse was to stay in the car, that sane German mechanism, and drive home.
Instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) went calling on friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) in the workshop, and then visited Stern's office.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) thought that with all that grit falling on the windows, it wasn't out of the question that
people inside P@lasz@ow would consider suicide. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was the one who seemed
depressed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) didn't ask any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) usual questions, such as <div class="bookquote">``All right, Herr Stern, if God
made man in His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) image, which race is most like Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)? Is a Pole more like Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) than a
Czech?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>There was none of that whimsy today. Instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) growled, <div class="bookquote">``What does everyone
think?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Stern told him (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) that the prisoners were like prisoners. They did their work and
hoped for survival.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm going to get you out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar grunted
all at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) put a balled fist on the
desk. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to get you all out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All?''  (<font color='red'><b>Stern/Itzhak Stern/Itzhak</b></font>)</div>asked Stern. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) couldn't help
himself. Such massive Biblical rescues
didn't suit the era.
<div class="bookquote">``You, anyhow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar. <div class="bookquote">``Y.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER 28
In Amon's office in the Administration
Building there were two typists. One was a young German woman, a Frau Kochmann;
the other, a studious young prisoner, Mietek Pemper. Pemper would one day become
secretary to Oskar, but in the summer of `44 he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) worked with Amon, and like anyone else
in that situation was not too sanguine about his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) chances.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) first came into close contact with Amon as accidentally as had Helen Hirsch, the
maid. Pemper was summoned to Amon's office after someone had recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) to
the Commandant. The young prisoner was a student of accounting, a touch typist, and
could take dictation in both Polish and German shorthand. His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) powers of memory were
said to be a byword. So, a prisoner of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) skills, Pemper found himself in P@lasz@ow's
main office with Amon, and would also sometimes take dictation from Amon at the villa.
The irony was that Pemper's photographic memory would in the end, more than the
memory of any other prisoner, bring about the hanging of Amon in Cracow. But Pemper
did not believe such an era would come. In 1944, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)'d had to guess who'd be the most
likely victim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) near-perfect recall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would have had to say Mietek Pemper himself.
Pemper was meant to be the backup typist. For confidential documents, Amon was to use
Frau Kochmann, a woman not nearly as competent as Mietek and slow at dictation.
Sometimes Amon would break the rule and let young Pemper take confidential dictation.
And Mietek, even while he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) sat across Amon's desk with the pad on his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) knee, could not
stop contradictory suspicions from distracting him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>). The first was that all these inside
reports and memoranda, whose details he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was retaining, would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) a prime witness
on the remote day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) and Amon stood before a tribunal. The other suspicion was
that Amon would, in the end, have to erase him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) as one later would a classified tape.
Nonetheless, Mietek prepared each morning not only his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) own sets of typing paper,
carbons, and duplicates, but a dozen for the German girl. After the girl had done her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
typing, Pemper would pretend to destroy the carbons, but in fact would keep and read
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) kept no written records, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had had this reputation for memory since school
days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) knew that if that tribunal ever met, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) and Amon sat in the body of the court,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would astound the Commandant with the precise dating of his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) evidence.
Pemper saw some astonishing classified documents. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) read, for example, memoranda
on the flogging of women. Camp commanders were to be reminded that it should be done
to maximum effect. It was demeaning to involve SS personnel, and therefore Czech
women were to be flogged by Slovak women, Slovaks by Czechs. Russians and Poles
were to be bracketed for the same purposes.
Commandants were to use their imagination in exploiting other national and cultural
differences.
Another bulletin reminded them that they did not hold in their own persons the right to
impose the death sentence. Commandants could seek authorization by telegram or letter
to the Reich Security Main Office. Amon had done this in the spring with two Jews
who'd escaped from the subcamp at Wieliczka and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) proposed to hang. A
telegram of permission had returned from Berlin, signed, Pemper noticed, by Dr.
Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Chief of the Reich
Security Main Office.
Now, in April, Pemper read a memorandum from Gerhard Maurer, the Labor Allocation
Chief of General Gl@ucks's Section D.
Maurer wanted Amon to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) how many Hungarians could be held temporarily at
P@lasz@ow. They were meant ultimately to go to the German Armament Works, DAW,
which was a subsidiary of Krupp making artillery-shell fuses in the enormous complex at
Auschwitz. Given that Hungary had only recently been taken over as a German
Protectorate, these Hungarian Jews and dissidents were in a better state of health than
those who had had years of ghettoization and prison life. They were therefore a windfall
for the factories of Auschwitz.
Unfortunately, accommodation at DAW was not yet ready for them, and if the
commandant of P@lasz@ow would take up to 7,000, pending the proper arrangements,
Section D would be extremely grateful.
Goeth's answer, either seen or typed by Pemper, was that P@lasz@ow was up to
capacity and that there was no building space left inside the electric fences. However,
Amon could accept up to 10,000 transit prisoners if -LRB-a-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) were permitted to liquidate the
unproductive element inside the camp; and -LRB-b-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) were at the same time to impose double
bunking. Maurer wrote in reply that double bunking could not be permitted in summer
for fear of typhus, and that ideally, according to the regulations, there should be a
minimum 3 cubic meters of air per person.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Maurer</b></font>) was willing to authorize Goeth to undertake
the first option. Section D would advise
Auschwitz-Birkenau--or at least, the
extermination wing of that great enterprise--to expect a shipment of reject prisoners from
P@lasz@ow. At the same time, Ostbahn transport would be arranged with cattle cars, of
course, run up the spur from the main line to the very gate of P@lasz@ow.
Amon therefore had to conduct a sorting-out process inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) camp.
With the blessing of Maurer and Section D, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maurer</b></font>) would in a day abolish as many lives as
Oskar Schindler was, by wit and reckless spending, harboring in Emalia. Amon named
his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) selection session Die Gesundheitaktion, the Health Action.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) managed it as one would manage a country
fair. When it began, on the morning of Sunday,
May 7, the Appellplatz was hung with
banners: <div class="bookquote">``FOR EVERY PRISONER,
APPROPRIATE WORK!''  (<font color='red'><b>Appellplatz</b></font>)</div>Loudspeakers played
ballads and Strauss and love songs. Beneath them
was set a table where Dr. Blancke, the SS
physician, sat with Dr. Leon Gross and a
number of clerks. Blancke's concept of
<div class="bookquote">``health''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Blancke/Blancke</b></font>)</div>was as eccentric as that of any doctor in
the SS. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had rid the prison clinic of the
chronically ill by injecting benzine into their
bloodstreams. These injections could not by anyone's
definition be called mercy killings. The patient
was seized by convulsions which ended in a choking death after
a quarter of an hour. Marek Biberstein, once
president of the Judenrat and now, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>)
two-year imprisonment in Montelupich
Street, a citizen of P@lasz@ow, had
suffered heart failure and been brought to the Krankenstube. Before Blancke could get to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>) with a benzine syringe, Dr. Idek Schindel, uncle of that Genia whose distant figure
had galvanized Schindler two years before, had come to Biberstein's bedside with a
number of colleagues. One had injected a more merciful dose of cyanide.
Today, flanked by the filing cabinets of the entire prison population, Blancke would deal
with the prisoners a barracks at a time, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>) finished with one battery of cards it
would be taken away and replaced by the next.
As they reached the Appellplatz, prisoners were told to strip. They were lined up naked
and run back and forth in front of the doctors. Blancke and Leon Gross, the collaborating
Jewish physician, would make notations on the card, point at this prisoner, call on that
one to verify his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) name. Back the prisoners would run, the physicians looking for signs of
disease or muscular weakness. It was an odd and humiliating exercise. Men with
dislocated backs -LRB-pfefferberg, for example, whose back Hujar had thrown out with the
blow of a whip handle-RRB-; women with chronic diarrhea, red cabbage rubbed into their
cheeks to give them color--all of them running for their lives and understanding that it
was so. Young Mrs. Kinstlinger, who'd sprinted for Poland at the Berlin Olympics, knew
that all that had been just a game. This was the true contest. With your stomach turning
and your breath thin, you ran--beneath the throb of the lying music--for your golden
life. No prisoner found out the results until the following Sunday when, under the same
banners and band music, the mass of inmates was again assembled. As names were read
out and the rejects of the Gesundheitaktion were marched to the eastern end of the square,
there were cries of outrage and bewilderment. Amon had expected a riot and had sought
the help of the Wehrmacht garrison of Cracow, who were on standby in case of a prisoner
uprising. Nearly 300 children had been discovered during the inspection the previous
Sunday, and as they were now dragged away, the protests and wailings of parents were so
loud that most of the garrison, together with Security Police detachments called in from
Cracow, had to be thrown into the cordon separating the two groups. This confrontation
lasted for hours, the guards forcing back surges of demented parents and telling the usual
lies to those who had relatives among the rejects. Nothing had been announced, but
everyone knew that those down there had failed the test and had no future. Blurred by
waltzes and comic songs from the loudspeakers, a pitiable babel of messages was shouted
from one group to the other. Henry Rosner, himself in torment, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) son, Olek, in fact
hidden somewhere in the camp, had the bizarre experience of facing a young SS man
who, with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, denounced what was happening and made a pledge to
volunteer for the Eastern Front. But officers shouted that unless people showed a little
discipline, they would order their men to open fire. Perhaps Amon hoped that a justifiable
outbreak of shooting would further reduce the overcrowding.
At the end of the process, 1,400 adults and 268 children stood, hedged in by weapons, at
the eastern rim of the Appellplatz, ready for fast shipment to Auschwitz. Pemper would
see and memorize the figures, which Amon would consider disappointing. Though it was
not the number for which Amon had hoped, it would create immediate room for a large
temporary intake of Hungarians.
In Dr. Blancke's card-file system, the children of P@lasz@ow had not been as precisely
registered as the adults. Many of them chose to spend both these Sundays in hiding, both
they and their parents knowing instinctively that their age and the absence of their names
and other details from the camp's documentation would make them obvious targets of the
selection process.
Olek Rosner hid in the ceiling of a hut on
the second Sunday. There were two other children with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>)
all day above the rafters, and all day they kept
the discipline of silence, all day held their
bladders among the lice and the little packages of
prisoners' belongings and the rooftop rats. For the
children knew as well as any adult that the SS and the
Ukrainians were wary of the spaces above the
ceiling. They believed them typhus-ridden, and had
been informed by Dr. Blancke that it took but a
fragment of louse feces in a crack in your skin
to bring on epidemic typhus. Some of
P@lasz@ow's children had been housed for months
near the men's prison in the hut marked
ACHTUNG TYPHUS.
This Sunday, for Olek Rosner, Amon's
health Aktion was far more perilous than typhus-bearing lice. Other children, some of the
268 separated out of the mass that day, had in fact begun the Aktion in hiding. Each
P@lasz@ow child, with that same toughness of mind, had chosen a favorite hiding place.
Some favored depressions beneath huts, some the laundry, some a shed behind the
garage. Many of these hideouts had been discovered either this Sunday or last, and no
longer offered refuge.
A further group had been brought without suspicion to the Appellplatz. There were
parents who knew this or that NCO. It was as Himmler had once complained, for even SS
Oberscharf@uhrers who did not flinch in the act of execution had their favorites, as if the
place were a school playground. If there was a question about the children, some parents
thought, you could appeal to an SS man who knew you.
The previous Sunday a thirteen-year-old orphan thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d be safe because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, at
other roll calls, passed for a young man. But naked, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wasn't able to argue away the
childlikeness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been told to dress and been marked down for the
children's group.
Now, as parents at the other end of the
Appellplatz cried out for their rounded-up children and
while the loudspeakers brayed forth a sentimental
song called <div class="bookquote">``Mammi, kauf mir
ein Pferdchen''  (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div>-LRB-mummy, buy me a
pony-RRB-, the boy simply passed from one group to another, moved with that infallible
instinct which had once characterized the movement of the red-capped child in Plac
Zgody. And as with Redcap, no one had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood, a plausible adult among the
others, as the hateful music roared and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heart sought to beat its way through his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rib
cage. Then, faking the cramps of diarrhea, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked a guard to let him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) go to the latrine.
The long latrines lay beyond the men's camp, and arriving there the boy stepped over the
plank on which men sat while defecating. An arm either side of the pit, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lowered
himself, trying to find knee- and toeholds in either wall. The stench blinded him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and flies
invaded his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mouth and ears and nostrils. As he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) entered the larger foulness and touched
the bottom of the pit, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed to hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) believed to be a hallucinatory murmur of
voices behind the rage of flies. were they behind you? said one voice. And another said,
Dammit, this is our place!
There were ten children in there with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Amon's report made use of the compound
word Sonderbehandlung--Special Treatment.
It was a term that would become famous in later years, but this was the first time that
Pemper had come across it. Of course, it had a sedative, even medical ring, but Mietek
could tell by now that medicine was not involved.
A telegram Amon dictated that morning to be transmitted to Auschwitz gave more than a
hint of its meaning. Amon explained that to make escape more difficult he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had insisted
that those selected for Special Treatment should drop any remnants of civilian clothing
they still possessed at the rail siding and should put on striped prison clothes there. Since
a great shortage of such garments prevailed, the stripes in which the P@lasz@ow
candidates for Special Treatment turned up at Auschwitz should be sent back at once to
Concentration Camp P@lasz@ow for reuse.
And all the children left in P@lasz@ow, of whom the greatest number were those who
shared the latrine with the tall orphan, hid out or impersonated adults until later searches
discovered them and took them to the Ostbahn for the slow day's journey 60 kilometers
to Auschwitz. The cattle cars were used that way all through high summer, taking troops
and supplies east to the stalemated lines near Lw@ow and, on the return trip, wasting
time at sidings while SS doctors watched ceaseless lines of the naked run before them.

<p/>CHAPTER 29
Oskar, sitting in Amon's office, the windows flung open to a breathless summer's day,
had the impression from the start that this meeting was a fake. Perhaps Madritsch and
Bosch felt the same, for their gaze kept drifting away from Amon toward the limestone
trolleys outside the window, toward any passing truck or wagon.
Only Untersturmf@uhrer Leo John,
who took notes, felt the need to sit up
straight and keep his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) top button done up. Amon had described it as a security conference.
Though the Front had now been stabilized, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) said, the advance of the Russian center to
the suburbs of Warsaw had encouraged partisan activity all over the Government
General. Jews who heard of it were encouraged to attempt escapes. They did not know, of
course, Amon pointed out, that they were better off behind the wire than exposed to those
Jew-killers among the Polish partisans. In any case, everyone had to beware of partisan
attack from outside and, worst of all, of collusion between the partisans and the prisoners.
Oskar tried to imagine the partisans invading P@lasz@ow, letting all the Poles and Jews
pour out, making of them an instant army. It was a daydream, and who could believe it?
But there was Amon, straining to convince them all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) believed it. It had a purpose,
this little act. Oskar was sure of that.
Bosch said, <div class="bookquote">``If the partisans are coming out to your place, Amon, I hope it's not a night
when I've been invited.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bosch/Herr Bosch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Amen, amen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>murmured Schindler.
After the meeting, whatever it meant, Oskar took Amon to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) car, parked outside the
Administration Building. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) opened the trunk. Inside lay a richly tooled saddle worked
with designs characteristic of the Zakopane region in the mountains south of Cracow. It
was necessary for Oskar to keep priming Amon with such gifts even now that payment
for the forced labor of DEF no longer went anywhere near Hauptsturmf@uhrer Goeth
but, instead, was sent directly to the Cracow area representative of General Pohl's
Oranienburg headquarters.
Oskar offered to drive both Amon and his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) saddle down to the Commandant's villa.
On such a blistering day, some of the trolley-pushers were showing a little less than the
required zeal. But the saddle had mollified Amon, and in any case, it was no longer
permitted for him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) to jump from a car and shoot people down in their tracks. The car
rolled past the garrison barracks and came to the siding where a string of cattle cars
stood. Oskar could tell, by the haze hanging above the cars and blending withand
wavering in the heat rebounding from the roofs, that they were full. Even above the
sound of the engine, you could hear the mourning from inside, the pleas for water.
Oskar braked his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) car and listened. This was
permitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), in view of the splendid
multiz@loty saddle in the trunk. Amon
smiled indulgently at his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) sentimental friend. They're partly P@lasz@ow people, said
Amon, and people from the work camp at Szebnie. And Poles and Jews from
Montelupich. They're going to Mauthausen, Amon said whimsically. They're
complaining now? They don't know what complaint is.
...
The roofs of the cars were bronzed with heat. You have no objection, said Oskar, if I call
out your fire brigade?
Amon gave a What-will-you-think-of-next? sort of laugh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) implied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) wouldn't
let anyone else summon the firemen, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)'d tolerate Oskar because Oskar was such a
character and the whole business would make a good dinner-party anecdote.
But as Oskar sent Ukrainian guards to ring the bell for the Jewish firemen, Amon was
bemused.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) knew that Oskar knew what Mauthausen
meant. If you hosed the cars for people, you were making
them promises about a future. And would not such
promises constitute, in anyone's code, a
true cruelty? So disbelief mingled with
tolerant amusement in Amon as the hoses were
run out and jets of water fell hissing on the
scalding cartops. Neuschel also came down from
the office to shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Neuschel</b></font>) head and smile as the people
inside the cars moaned and roared with
gratitude. Gr@un, Amon's bodyguard,
stood chatting with Untersturmf@uhrer John
and clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) side and hooted as the water rained
down. Even at full extension the hoses reached
only halfway down the line of cars. Next,
Oskar was asking Amon for the loan of a truck or
wagon andofa few Ukrainians to drive
into Zablocie and fetch the fire hoses from
DEF. They were 200-meter hoses, Oskar
said. Amon, for some reason, found that
sidesplitting. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I'll authorize
a truck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>said Amon. Amon was willing to do anything for the sake of the comedy of life.
Oskar gave the Ukrainians a note for
Bankier and Garde. While they were gone, Amon
was so willing to enter the spirit of the event that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
permitted the doors of the cars to be opened and
buckets of water to be passed in and the dead, with
their pink, swollen faces, to be lifted out. And
still, all around the railway siding stood amused
SS officers and NCO'S. <div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
think he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)'s saving them from?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>When the large hoses from DEF arrived and all the cars had been drenched, the joke took
on new dimensions. Oskar, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) note to Bankier, had instructed that the manager also go
into Oskar's own apartment and fill a hamper with liquor and cigarettes, some good
cheeses and sausages, and so on. Oskar now handed the hamper to the NCO at the rear of
the train. It was an open transaction, and the man seemed a little embarrassed at the
largesse, shoving it quickly into the rear van in case one of the officers of KL
P@lasz@ow reported him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). Yet Oskar seemed to be in such curious favor with the
Commandant that the NCO listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) respectfully. <div class="bookquote">``When you stop near stations,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar, <div class="bookquote">``will you open the car doors?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Years later, two survivors of the
transport, Doctors Rubinstein and
Feldstein, would let Oskar know that the NCO had
frequently ordered the doors opened and the water
buckets regularly filled on the tedious
journey to Mauthausen. For most of the
transport, of course, that was no more than a comfort before dying.
As Oskar moves along the string of cars, accompanied by the laughter of the SS, bringing
a mercy which is in large part futile, it can be seen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'s not so much reckless
anymore but possessed. Even Amon can tell that his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) friend has shifted into a new gear.
All this frenzy about getting the hoses as far as the farthest car, then bribing an SS man in
full view of the SS personnel--it would take just a shift in degree or so in the laughter of
Scheidt or John or Hujar to bring about a mass denunciation of Oskar, a piece of
information the Gestapo could not ignore. And then Oskar would go into Montelupich
and, in view of previous racial charges against him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), probably on to Auschwitz. So Amon
was horrified by the way Oskar insisted on treating those dead as if they were poor
relations traveling third class but bound for a genuine destination.
Some time after two, a locomotive hauled the whole miserable string of cattle cars away
toward the main line, and all the hoses could again be wound up. Schindler delivered
Amon and his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) saddle to the Goeth villa. Amon could see that Oskar was still preoccupied
and, for the first time in their association, gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) friend some advice about living. You
have to relax, said Amon. You can't go running after every trainload that leaves this
place.
Adam Garde, engineer and prisoner of Emalia, also saw symptoms of this shift in Oskar.
On the night of July 20, an SS man had come into Garde's barracks and roused him (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>). The
Herr Direktor had called the guardhouse and said it was necessary to see engineer Garde,
professionally, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) office.
Garde found Oskar listening to the radio, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) face flushed, a bottle and two glasses in
front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) on the table. Behind the desk these days was a relief map of Europe. It had
never been there in the days of German expansion, but Oskar seemed to take a sharp
interest in the shrinkage of the German Fronts. Tonight he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had the radio tuned to the
Deutschlandsender, not--as was usually the case--to the BBC. Inspirational music was
being played, as it often was as prelude to important announcements.
Oskar seemed to be listening avidly. When Garde came in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) stood up and hustled the
young engineer to a seat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) poured cognac and passed it hurriedly across the desk.
<div class="bookquote">``There's been an attempt on Hitler's life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar.
It had been announced earlier in the evening, and the story then was that Hitler had
survived. They'd promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hitler</b></font>) would soon be speaking to the German people. But it
hadn't happened. Hours had passed and they hadn't been able to produce him (<font color='blue'><b>Hitler</b></font>). And they
kept playing a lot of Beethoven, the way they had when Stalingrad fell.
Oskar and Garde sat together for hours. A seditious event, a Jew and a German listening
together--all night if necessary--to discover if the F@uhrer had died. Adam Garde, of
course, suffered that same breathless surge of hope. He (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) noticed that Oskar kept gesturing
limply, as if the possibility that the Leader was dead had unstrung his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) muscles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) drank
devoutly and urged Garde to drink up. If it was true, said Oskar, then Germans, ordinary
Germans like himself, could begin to redeem themselves.
Purely because someone close to Hitler had had the
guts to remove him (<font color='blue'><b>Hitler</b></font>) from the earth. It's the end of the
SS, said Oskar. Himmler will be in jail
by morning.
Oskar blew clouds of smoke. Oh, my
God, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said, the relief to see the end of this system!
The 10 P.m. news brought only the earlier statement. There had been an attempt on the
F@uhrer's life but it had failed and the F@uhrer would be broadcasting in a few minutes.
When, as the hour passed, Hitler did not speak, Oskar turned to a fantasy which would be
popular with many Germans as the war drew to a close. <div class="bookquote">``Our troubles are over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``The world's sane again. Germany can ally itself with the West against the Russians.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Garde/Adam Garde/Adam</b></font>)</div>Garde's hopes were more modest. At worst, he (<font color='blue'><b>Garde</b></font>) hoped for a ghetto which was a ghetto in
the old Franz Josef sense.
And as they drank and the music played, it seemed more and more reasonable that
Europe would yield them that night the death vital to its sanity. They were citizens of the
continent again; they were not the prisoner and the Herr Direktor. The radio's promises to
produce a message from the F@uhrer recurred, and every time, Oskar laughed with
increasing point.
Midnight came and they paid no attention anymore to the promises. Their very breath
was lighter in this new post-F@uhrer Cracow.
By morning, they surmised, there would be dancing in every
square, and it would go unpunished. The
Wehrmacht would arrest Frank in the Wawel
and encircle the SS complex in
Pomorska Street.
A little before 1 A.m., Hitler was heard
broadcasting from Rastenberg. Oskar had been so convinced that that voice was a voice
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would never need to hear again that for a few seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) did not recognize the sound,
in spite of its familiarity, thinking it just another temporizing Party spokesman. But
Garde heard the speech from its first word, and knew whose voice it was. <div class="bookquote">``My German
comrades!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it began. <div class="bookquote">``If I speak to you today, it is first in order that you should hear my
voice and should know that I am unhurt and well, and, second, that you should know of a
crime unparalleled in German history.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the conspirators</b></font>)</div>The speech ended four minutes later with a
reference to the conspirators. <div class="bookquote">``This time we shall
settle accounts with them in the manner to which we National Socialists are accustomed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Garde/Adam Garde/Adam</b></font>)</div>Adam Garde had never quite bought the fantasy Oskar had been pushing all evening. For
Hitler was more than a man: he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was a system with ramifications. Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) died, it was
no guarantee the system would alter its character. Besides, it was not in the nature of a
phenomenon such as Hitler to perish in the space of a single evening. But Oskar had
been believing in the death with a feverish conviction for hours now, and when it turned
out to be an illusion, it was young Garde who found himself cast as the comforter, while
Oskar spoke with an almost operatic grief. <div class="bookquote">``All our vision of deliverance is futile,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) poured another glass of cognac each, then pushed the bottle across the desk,
opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) cigarette box. <div class="bookquote">``Take the cognac and some cigarettes and get some sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``We'll have to wait a little longer for our freedom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Garde/Adam Garde/Adam</b></font>)</div>In the confusion of the cognac, of the news and of its sudden reversal in the small hours,
Garde did not think it strange that Oskar was talking about <div class="bookquote">``our freedom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>as if they had
an equivalent need, were both prisoners who had to wait passively to be liberated. But
back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) bunk Garde thought, It's amazing that Herr Direktor should have talked like
that, like someone easily given to fantasies and fits of depression. Usually, he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) was so
pragmatic.
Pomorska Street and the camps around Cracow crawled with rumors that late summer, of
some imminent rearrangement of prisoners.
The rumors troubled Oskar in Zablocie, and at P@lasz@ow, Amon got unofficial word
that the camps would be disbanded.
In fact that meeting about security had to do not with
saving P@lasz@ow from partisans, but with the coming
closure of the camp. Amon had called
Madritsch and Oskar and Bosch out
to P@lasz@ow and held the meeting just to give himself protective coloration. It then
became plausible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to drive into Cracow and call on Wilhelm Koppe, the new SS
police chief of the Government General. Amon sat on the far side of Koppe's desk
wearing a fake frown, cracking his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) knuckles as if from the stress of a besieged
P@lasz@ow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) told Koppe the same story he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)'d given Oskar and the others--that
partisan organizations had sprung up inside the camp, that Zionists within the wire had
had communication with radicals of the Polish People's Army and the Jewish Combat
Organization. As the Obergruppenf@uhrer could appreciate, that sort of communication
was difficult to stamp out--messages could come in in a smuggled loaf of bread. But at
the first sign of active rebellion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)--Amon Goeth--as Commandant, would need to be
able to take summary action. The question Amon wanted to ask was, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) fired first and
did the paperwork for Oranienburg afterward, would the distinguished
Obergruppenf@uhrer Koppe stand by him (<font color='blue'><b>Koppe</b></font>)?
No problem, said Koppe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Koppe</b></font>) didn't really approve of bureaucrats either. In years past, as
police chief of the Wartheland, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)'d commanded the fleet of extermination trucks which
carried Untermenschen out into the countryside and which then, running the engines at
full throttle, pumped the exhaust back into the locked interior. That too was an off-thecuff
operation, not permitting precise paperwork. Of course, you have to use your
judgment, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) told Amon. And if you do, I'll back you.
Oskar had sensed at the meeting that Amon was not really worried about partisans. Had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) known then that P@lasz@ow was to be liquidated, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would have understood the
deeper meaning of Amon's performance. For Amon was worried about Wilek
Chilowicz, his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) Jewish chief of camp police. Amon had often used Chilowicz as an agent
on the black market. Chilowicz knew Cracow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) could sell the flour,
rice, butter the Commandant held back from the camp supplies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) knew the dealers who
would be interested in product from the custom jewelry shop staffed by interns like
Wulkan. Amon was worried about the whole Chilowicz clique: Mrs.
Marysia Chilowicz, who enjoyed conjugal
privileges; Mietek Finkelstein, an
associate; Chilowicz' sister Mrs. Ferber;
and Mr. Ferber. If there had been an
aristocracy inside P@lasz@ow, it had been the Chilowiczes. They had had power over
prisoners, but their knowledge was double-edged: they knew as much about Amon as
they did about some miserable machinist in the Madritsch factory. If, when P@lasz@ow
closed, they were shipped to another camp, Amon knew they would try to barter their
inside knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) rackets as soon as they found themselves in the wrong line. Or
more likely, as soon as they were hungry.
Of course, Chilowicz was uneasy too, and
Amon could sense in him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) the doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would be
allowed to leave P@lasz@ow. Amon decided
to use Chilowicz' very concern as a lever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
called Sowinski, an SS auxiliary
recruited from the High Tatras of
Czechoslovakia, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) office for a conference. Sowinski was to approach Chilowicz
and pretend to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) an escape deal. Amon was sure that Chilowicz would be eager to
negotiate.
Sowinski went and did it well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) told
Chilowicz he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) could get the whole clan out of the camp in one of the large fuel-burning
trucks. You could sit half a dozen people in the wood furnace if you were running on
gas.
Chilowicz was interested in the proposition. Sowinski would of course need to deliver a
note to friends on the outside, who would provide a vehicle. Sowinski would deliver the
clan to the rendezvous point in the truck. Chilowicz was willing to pay in diamonds. But,
said Chilowicz, as an earnest of their mutual trust, Sowinski must provide a weapon.
Sowinski reported the meeting to the Commandant, and Amon gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) a .38-caliber
pistol with the pin filed down. This was passed to Chilowicz, who of course had neither
need nor opportunity to test-fire it. Yet Amon would be able to swear to both Koppe and
Oranienburg that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had found a weapon on the prisoner.
It was a Sunday in mid-August when
Sowinski met the Chilowiczes in the
building-material shed and hid them in the truck.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) drove down Jerozolimska to the gate. There should be routine formalities there;
then the truck could roll out into the countryside. In the empty furnace, in the pulses of
the five escapees was the febrile, almost insupportable hope of leaving Amon behind.
At the gate, however, were Amon and Amthor and Hujar, and the Ukrainian Ivan
Scharujew. A leisurely inspection was made. Lumbering with half-smiles across the bed
of the truck, the gentlemen of the SS saved the wood furnace till last. They mimed
surprise when they discovered the pitiable Chilowicz clan sardine-tight in the wood hole.
As soon as Chilowicz had been dragged out, Amon <div class="bookquote">``found''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>the illegal gun tucked into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) boot.
Chilowicz' pockets were laden with diamonds, bribes paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) by the desperate inmates
of the camp.
Prisoners at their day of rest heard that
Chilowicz was under sentence down there at the gate. The news made for the same awe,
the confusion of emotions that had operated the night the year before when Symche Spira
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) OD had been executed. Nor could any prisoner decipher what it meant to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own
chances.
The Chilowicz crowd were executed one at a time with pistols. Amon, very yellow now
from liver disease, at the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) obesity, wheezing like an elderly uncle, put the
muzzle to Chilowicz' neck. Later the corpses were displayed in the Appellplatz with
placards tied to their chests: <div class="bookquote">``THOSE WHO VIOLATE JUST LAWS CAN EXPECT A
SIMILAR DEATH.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prisoners</b></font>)</div>That, of course, was not the moral the prisoners of P@lasz@ow took from the sight.
Amon spent the afternoon drafting two long reports, one to Koppe, one to General
Gl@ucks's Section D, explaining how he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had saved P@lasz@ow from an insurgency in
its first phase--the one in which a group of key conspirators escaped from the camp--by
executing the plot's leaders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) did not finish revising either draft till 11 P.m. Frau
Kochmann was too slow for such late work, and so the Commandant had Mietek Pemper
roused from his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) barracks and brought to the villa. In the front parlor, Amon stated levelly
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) believed the boy had been party to Chilowicz' escape attempt. Pemper was
astounded and did not know how to answer. Looking around him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) for some sort of
inspiration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) saw the seam of his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) pants leg, which had come unsewn. How could I pass
on the outside in this sort of clothing? he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) asked.
The balance of frank desperation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) answer satisfied Amon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) told the boy to sit
down and instructed him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) how the typing was to be set out and the pages numbered.
Amon hit the papers with his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) spatulate fingertips. <div class="bookquote">``I want a first-class job done.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pemper/Mietek Pemper/Mietek</b></font>)</div>And
Pemper thought, That's the way of it--I can die now for being an escapee, or later in the
year for having seen these justifications of Amon's.
When Pemper was leaving the villa with the drafts in his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) hand, Goeth followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) out
onto the patio and called a last order. <div class="bookquote">``When you type the list of insurgents,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>Amon
called companionably, <div class="bookquote">``I want you to leave room above my signature for another name to
be inserted.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>Pemper nodded, discreet as any professional secretary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) stood just a half-second, trying
for inspiration, some fast answer that would reverse Amon's order about the extra space.
The space for his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) name. Mietek Pemper. In that hateful torrid silence of Sunday evening
in Jerozolimska, nothing plausible came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Herr Commandant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pemper/Mietek Pemper/Mietek</b></font>)</div>said Pemper.
As Pemper stumbled up the road to the
Administration Building, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) remembered a letter Amon had had him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) type earlier that
summer. It had been addressed to Amon's father, the Viennese publisher, and was full of
filial concern for an allergy which had troubled the old man that spring. Amon hoped
that it had lifted by now. The reason Pemper remembered that letter out of all the others
was that half an hour before he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)'d been called into Amon's office to take it down, the
Commandant had dragged a girl filing clerk outside and executed her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>). The juxtaposition
of the letter and the execution proved to Pemper that, for Amon, murder and allergies
were events of equal weight. And if you told a tractable stenographer to leave a space for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) name, it was a matter of course that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) left it.
Pemper sat at the typewriter for more than an hour, but in the end left the space for
himself. Not to do that would be even more suddenly fatal. There had been a rumor
among Stern's friends that Schindler had some movement of people in mind, some rescue
or other, but tonight rumors from Zablocie meant nothing anymore. Mietek typed;
Mietek left in each report the space for his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) own death. And all his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) remembrance of the
Commandant's criminal carbons which he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d so industriously memorized--all that was
made futile by the space he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) left.
When both typescripts were word-perfect, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) returned to the villa. Amon kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
waiting by the French windows while he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) himself sat in the parlor reading the documents.
Pemper wondered if his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) own body would be displayed with some declamatory lettering:
<div class="bookquote">``SO DIE ALL JEWISH BOLSHEVISTS!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pemper/Mietek Pemper/Mietek</b></font>)</div>At last Amon appeared at the windows. <div class="bookquote">``You may go to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Herr Commandant?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I said, you may go to bed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pemper/Mietek Pemper/Mietek</b></font>)</div>Pemper went. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) walked less steadily now. After what he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had seen, Amon could not let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) live. But perhaps the Commandant believed there would be leisure to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) later.
In the meantime, life for a day was still life.
The space, as it proved, was for an elderly prisoner who, by unwise dealings with men
like John and Hujar, had let it be known he (<font color='blue'><b>Hujar</b></font>) had a cache of diamonds somewhere outside
the camp. While Pemper sank into the sleep of the reprieved, Amon had the old man
summoned to the villa, offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) life for the diamonds' location, was shown the
place, and, of course, executed the old man and added his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name to the reports to Koppe
and Oranienburg--to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) humble claim of having snuffed out the spark of rebellion.

<p/>CHAPTER 30
The orders, labeled OKH -LRB-Army HIGH
COMMAND-RRB-, already sat on Oskar's desk. Because of the war situation, the Director of
Armaments told Oskar, KL P@lasz@ow and therefore the Emalia camp were to be
disbanded. Prisoners from Emalia would be sent to P@lasz@ow, awaiting relocation.
Oskar himself was to fold his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) Zablocie operation as quickly as possible, retaining on the
premises only those technicians necessary for dismantling the plant. For further
instructions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) should apply to the Evacuation Board, OKH, Berlin.
Oskar's initial reaction was a cool rage.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) resented the tone, the sense of a distant official trying to absolve him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) from further
concern. There was a man in Berlin who, not knowing of the black-market bread that
bound Oskar and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) prisoners together, thought it was reasonable for a factory owner to
open the gate and let the people be taken. But the worst arrogance was that the letter did
not define <div class="bookquote">``relocation.''  (<font color='red'><b>Governor</b></font>)</div>Governor General Frank was more honest than that and had made
a notorious speech a little earlier in the year. <div class="bookquote">``When we ultimately win the war, then as
far as I'm concerned, Poles, Ukrainians, and all that rabble idling around here can be
made into mincemeat, into anything you like.''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank</b></font>)</div>Frank had the courage to put an accurate
name to the process. In Berlin, they wrote <div class="bookquote">``relocation''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>and believed themselves excused.
Amon knew what <div class="bookquote">``relocation''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>meant and,
during Oskar's next visit to P@lasz@ow,
freely told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) so. All P@lasz@ow men
would be sent to Gr@oss-Rosen. The women would go
to Auschwitz. Gr@oss-Rosen was a vast
quarry camp in Lower Silesia. The German
Earth and Stone Works, an SS enterprise with
branches throughout Poland, Germany, and the conquered
territories, consumed the prisoners of
Gr@oss-Rosen. The processes at
Auschwitz were, of course, more direct and modern.
When the news of the abolition of Emalia reached the factory floor and ran through the
barracks, some Schindler people thought it was the end of all sanctuary. The Perlmans,
whose daughter had come out of Aryan cover to plead for them, packed their blankets
and talked philosophically to their bunk neighbors. Emalia has given us a year's rest, a
year's soup, a year's sanity. Perhaps it might be enough. But they expected to die now. It
was apparent from their voices.
Rabbi Levartov was resigned too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rabbi</b></font>) was going back to unfinished business with Amon.
Edith Liebgold, who'd been recruited by Bankier for the night shift in the first days of the
ghetto, noticed that although Oskar spent hours talking solemnly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) Jewish
supervisors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) did not come up to people and make dizzying promises. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was
as baffled and diminished by these orders from Berlin as the rest. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wasn't quite the
prophet he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d been the night she (<font color='blue'><b>Liebgold</b></font>)'d first come here more than three years ago.
Just the same, at the end of summer, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) prisoners packed their bundles and were
marched back to P@lasz@ow, there was a rumor among them that Oskar had spoken of
buying them back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had said it to Garde; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had said it to Bankier. You could almost
hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Bankier</b></font>) saying it--that level certainty, the paternal rumble of the throat. But as you
went up Jerozolimska Street, past the Administration Building, staring in newcomer's
disbelief at the hauling gangs from the quarry, the memory of Oskar's promises was very
nearly just another burden.
The Horowitz family were back in
P@lasz@ow. Their father, Dolek, had last year maneuvered them to Emalia, but here
they were back. The six-year-old boy, Richard; the mother, Regina. Niusia, eleven now,
was again sewing bristles onto brush paddles and watching, from the high windows, the
trucks roll up to the Austrian hill fort, and the black cremation smoke rise over the hill.
As P@lasz@ow was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) had left it last year, so it continued. It was impossible for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) to believe that it would ever end. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) father believed that Oskar would make a
list of people and extricate them. Oskar's list, in the mind of some, was already more than
a mere tabulation. It was a List. It was a sweet chariot which might swing low.
Oskar raised the idea of taking Jews away from Cracow with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) one night at Amon's
villa. It was a still night at the end of summer. Amon seemed pleased to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>).
Because of Amon's health--both Doctors Blancke and Gross warning him (<font color='blue'><b>Gross</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gross</b></font>)
didn't cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Gross</b></font>) eating and drinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Gross</b></font>) would die--there had not been so many visitors to
the villa of late.
They sat together, drinking at Amon's new rate of moderation. Oskar sprang the news on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wanted to move his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) factory to Czechoslovakia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wanted to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) skilled
workers with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) might need other skills from among the P@lasz@ow workers too.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would seek the help of the Evacuation Board in
finding an appropriate site, somewhere down in
Moravia, and of the Ostbahn in making the shift
southwest from Cracow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) let Amon know that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)'d be very grateful for any support. The
mention of gratitude always excited
Amon. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) said, if Oskar could get
all the cooperation he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) needed from the boards involved, Amon would then allow a list of
people to be drawn up.
When that was settled, Amon wanted a game of cards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) liked blackjack, a version of
the French vingt-et-un. It was a hard game for junior officers to fake losing without being
obvious. It did not permit of too much sycophancy. It was therefore true sport, and Amon
preferred it. Besides, Oskar wasn't interested in losing this evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would be paying
enough to Amon for that list.
The Commandant began by betting modestly, in 100-z@loty bills, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) doctors had
advised moderation in this as well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) kept busting however, and when the beginning
stake had been raised to 500 z@l., Oskar got a <div class="bookquote">``natural,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>an ace and a jack, which meant
that Amon had to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) double the stake.
Amon was disconsolate about that, but not too testy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) called for Helen Hirsch to bring
coffee. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) came in, a parody of a gentleman's servant, crisply dressed still in black but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) right eye blinded by swelling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) was so small that Amon would need to stoop to
beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) up. The girl knew Oskar now, but did not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>). Nearly a year past, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had
promised to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) out. Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) came to the villa he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) managed to slip down the
corridor to the kitchen and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) was. It meant something, but it had not
touched the substance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) life. A few weeks back, for example, when the soup hadn't
been the correct temperature--
Amon was pernickety about soup, flyspecks in the corridor, fleas on dogs--the
Commandant had called for Ivan and Petr and told them to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) to the birch tree in the
garden and shoot her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)'d watched from the French windows as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) walked
in front of Petr's Mauser, pleading under her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>)
breath with the young Ukrainian. <div class="bookquote">``Petr, who's this
you're going to shoot? It's Helen. Helen who
gives you cakes. You couldn't shoot Helen, could
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Petr</b></font>)</div>And Petr answering in the same manner, through
clenched teeth, <div class="bookquote">``I know, Helen. I don't
want to. But if I don't, he (<font color='blue'><b>Petr</b></font>)'ll kill
me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Petr</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>)'d bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) head toward the spotted birch bark. Having often asked Amon why
he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) wouldn't kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) wanted to die simply, to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) willing acceptance. But
it wasn't possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) was trembling so hard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) could have seen it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) legs were
shaking. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>)'d heard Amon call from the windows, <div class="bookquote">``Bring the bitch back.
There's plenty of time to shoot her (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>). In the meantime, it might still be possible to educate
her (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>Insanely, in between his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) spates of savagery, there were brief phases in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) tried to
play the benign master. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) one morning, <div class="bookquote">``You're really a very welltrained
servant. If after the war you need a reference, I shall be happy to give you one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) knew it was just talk, a daydream. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) deaf ear, the one whose eardrum he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
had perforated with a blow. Sooner or later, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) knew, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) would die of his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) customary
fury.
In a life like hers, a smile from visitors was only a momentary comfort. Tonight she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>)
placed the enormous silver pot of coffee beside the Herr Commandant--he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) still drank it
by the bucket in cups laden with sugar--made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) obeisance, and left. Within an hour,
when Amon was 3,700 z@l. in debt to Oskar and complaining sourly about his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) luck,
Oskar suggested a variation on the betting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would need a maid in Moravia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) moved to Czechoslovakia. There you couldn't get them as intelligent and well
trained as Helen Hirsch. They were all country girls. Oskar suggested therefore that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
and Amon play one hand, double or nothing. If Amon won, Oskar would pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) 7,400
z@l. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) hit a <div class="bookquote">``natural,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>it would be 14,800 z@l. But if I win, said Oskar, then you give
me Helen Hirsch for my list.
Amon wanted to think about that. Come on, said Oskar, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>)'s going to Auschwitz
anyhow. But there was an attachment there. Amon was so used to Helen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) couldn't
easily wager her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) away.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)'d thought of an end for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), it had
probably always been that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
own hand, with personal passion. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) played
cards for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) and lost, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would be under pressure,
as a Viennese sportsman, to give up the
pleasure of intimate murder.
Much earlier in P@lasz@ow's history,
Schindler had asked that Helen be assigned to Emalia. But Amon had refused. It seemed
only a year ago that P@lasz@ow would exist for decades, and that the Commandant and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) maid would grow old together, at least until some perceived fault in Helen brought
about the abrupt end of the connection. This time a year ago, no one would have believed
that the relationship would be resolved because the Russians were outside Lw@ow. As
for Oskar's part in this proposal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had made it lightly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) did not seem to see, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
offer to Amon, any parallel with God and Satan playing cards for human souls. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did
not ask himself by what right he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made a bid for the girl. If he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lost, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) chance of
extracting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) some other way was slim. But all chances were slim that year. Even his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
own.
Oskar got up and bustled around the room, looking for stationery with an official
letterhead on it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wrote out the marker for Amon to sign should he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) lose: <div class="bookquote">``I authorize
that the name of prisoner Helen Hirsch be added to any list of skilled workers relocated
with Herr Oskar Schindler's DEF Works.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Amon was dealer and gave Oskar an 8 and a 5. Oskar asked to be dealt more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) received
a 5 and an ace. It would have to do. Then Amon dealt to himself. A 4 came up, and then a
king.
God in heaven! said Amon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was a
gentleman cusser; he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) seemed to be too
fastidious to use obscenities. I'm out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) laughed a little but was not really amused. My
first cards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) explained, were a three and a five. With a four I should have been safe.
Then I got this damned king.
In the end, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) signed the marker. Oskar picked up all the chits he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d won that evening
from Amon and returned them. Just look after the girl for me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) said, till it's time for us
all to leave.
Out in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kitchen, Helen Hirsch did not know she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>)'d been saved over cards.
Probably because Oskar reported his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) evening with Amon to Stern, rumors of Oskar's plan
were heard in the Administration Building and even in the workshops. There was a
Schindler list. It was worth everything to be on it.

<p/>CHAPTER 31
At some point in any discussion of Schindler, the surviving friends of the Herr Direktor
will blink and shake their heads and begin the almost mathematical business of finding
the sum of his (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) motives. For one of the commonest sentiments of Schindler Jews is still <div class="bookquote">``I
don't know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) did it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Schindler Jews</b></font>)</div>It can be said to begin with that Oskar was a gambler, was a
sentimentalist who loved the transparency, the simplicity of doing good; that Oskar was
by temperament an anarchist who loved to ridicule the system; and that beneath the
hearty sensuality lay a capacity to be outraged by human savagery, to react to it and not
to be overwhelmed. But none of this, jotted down, added up, explains the doggedness
with which, in the autumn of 1944, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) prepared a final haven for the graduates of Emalia.
And not only for them. In early September he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) drove to Podg@orze and visited Madritsch,
who at that point employed more than 3,000 prisoners in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) uniform factory. This plant
would now be disbanded. Madritsch would get his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) sewing machines back, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>)
workers would vanish. If we made a combined approach, said Oskar, we could get more
than four thousand out. Mine and yours as well. We could relocate them in something
like safety. Down in Moravia.
Madritsch would always and justly be revered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) surviving prisoners. The bread and
chickens smuggled into his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) factory were paid for from his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) pocket and at continuous risk.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) would have been considered a more stable man than Oskar. Not as flamboyant, and
not as subject to obsession. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had not suffered arrest. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had been much more
humane than was safe and, without wit and energy, would have ended in Auschwitz.
Now Oskar presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) a vision of a Madritsch-Schindler camp somewhere in the
High Jeseniks; some smoky, safe little industrial hamlet.
Madritsch was attracted by the idea but did not rush to say yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) could tell that though
the war was lost, the SS system had become more instead of less implacable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) was
correct in believing that, unhappily, the prisoners of P@lasz@ow would--in coming
months--be consumed in death camps to the west. For if Oskar was stubborn and
possessed, so were the SS Main Office and their prize field operatives, the commandants
of the Concentration Camps.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) did not say no, however. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) needed time to think about it. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) couldn't say it
to Oskar, it is likely he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was afraid of sharing factory premises with a rash, demonic
fellow like Herr Schindler.
Without any clear word from Madritsch, Oskar
took to the road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) went to Berlin and bought
dinner for Colonel Erich Lange. I can go
completely over to the manufacture of shells,
Oskar told Lange. I can transfer my
heavy machinery.
Lange was crucial. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lange</b></font>) could guarantee
contracts; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lange</b></font>) could write the hearty
recommendations Oskar needed for the Evacuation Board and the German officials in
Moravia. Later, Oskar would say of this shadowy staff officer that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had given
consistent help. Lange was still in that state of exalted desperation and moral disgust
characteristic of many who had worked inside the system but not always for it. We can
do it, said Lange but it will take some money. Not for me. For others.
Through Lange, Oskar talked with an officer of the Evacuation Board at OKH on Bendler
Street. It was likely, said this officer, that the evacuation would be approved in principle.
But there was a major obstacle. The Governor cum Gauleiter of Moravia, ruling from a
castle at Liberec, had followed a policy of keeping Jewish labor camps out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>)
province.
Neither the SS nor the Armaments Inspectorate had so far persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>)
attitude. A good man to discuss this impasse with, said the officer, would be a middleaged
Wehrmacht engineer down in the Troppau office of the Armaments Inspectorate, a
man named Sussmuth. Oskar could talk to Sussmuth too about what relocation sites were
available in Moravia. Meanwhile, Herr Schindler could count on the support of the Main
Evacuation Board. <div class="bookquote">``But you can understand that in view of the pressure they are under,
and the inroads the war has made on their personal comforts, they are more likely to give
a quick answer if you could be considerate to them in some way. We poor city fellows
are short of ham, cigars, liquor, cloth, coffee ... that sort of thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The officer</b></font>)</div>The officer seemed to think that Oskar carried around with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) half the peacetime
produce of Poland. Instead, to get together a gift parcel for the gentlemen of the board,
Oskar had to buy luxuries at the Berlin black-market rate.
An old gentleman on the desk at the Hotel Adlon was able to acquire excellent schnapps
for Herr Schindler for a discount price of about 80 RM. a bottle. And you couldn't send
the gentlemen of the board less than a dozen. Coffee, however, was like gold, and
Havanas were at an insane price. Oskar bought them in quantity and included them in the
hamper. The gentlemen might need a head of steam if they were to bring the Governor of
Moravia around. In the midst of Oskar's negotiations, Amon Goeth was arrested.
Someone must have informed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>). Some jealous junior officer, or a concerned citizen
who'd visited the villa and been shocked by Amon's sybaritic style. A senior SS
investigator named Eckert began to look at Amon's financial dealings. The shots Amon
had taken from the balcony were not germane to Eckert's investigation. But the
embezzlements and the black-market dealings were, as were complaints from some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
SS inferiors that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had treated them severely.
Amon was on leave in Vienna, staying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) father, the publisher, when the SS
arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>). They also raided an apartment Hauptsturmf@uhrer Goeth kept in the city
and discovered a cache of money, some 80,000 RM., which Amon could not explain to
their satisfaction. They found as well, stacked to the ceiling, close to a million cigarettes.
Amon's Viennese apartment, it seemed, was more warehouse than pied @a terre.
It might be at first sight surprising that the SS--OR rather, the officers of Bureau V of the
Reich Security Main Office--should want to arrest such an effective servant as
Hauptsturmf@uhrer Goeth. But they had already investigated irregularities in
Buchenwald and tried to pin the Commandant, Koch. They had even attempted to find
evidence for the arrest of the renowned Rudolf H@oss, and had questioned a Viennese
Jewess who, they suspected, was pregnant by this star of the camp system. So Amon,
raging in his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) apartment while they ransacked it, had no cause to hope for much immunity.
They took him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) to Breslau and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) in an SS prison to await investigation and trial.
They showed their innocence of the way affairs were run in P@lasz@ow by going to the
villa and questioning Helen Hirsch on suspicion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) being involved in Amon's
swindles. Twice in coming months she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) would be taken to the cells beneath the SS
barracks of P@lasz@ow for interrogation. They fired questions at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) about Amon's
contacts on the black market--who his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) agents were, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) worked the jewelry shop at
P@lasz@ow, the custom-tailoring shop, the upholstery plant. No one hit her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) or
threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>). But it was their conviction that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) was a member of a gang that
tormented her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>). If Helen had ever thought of an unlikely and glorious salvation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) would
not have dared dream that Amon would be arrested by his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) own people. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
sanity going now in the interrogation room, when under their law they tried to shackle her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
to Amon. Chilowicz might have been able to help you, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) told them. But Chilowicz is
dead.
They were policemen by trade, and after a time would decide she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) could give them
nothing except a little information about the sumptuous cuisine at the villa Goeth. They
could have asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) scars, but they knew they couldn't get Amon on grounds
of sadism. Investigating sadism in the camp at Sachsenhausen, they'd been forced off the
prem-ises by armed guards. In Buchenwald they had found a material witness, an NCO,
to testify against the Commandant, but the informer had been found dead in his (<font color='blue'><b>informer</b></font>) cell. The
head of that SS investi-gating team ordered that samples of a poison found in the NCO'S
stomach be administered to four Russian prisoners. He (<font color='blue'><b>informer</b></font>) watched them die, and so had his (<font color='blue'><b>informer</b></font>)
proof against the Commandant and the camp doctor. Even though he (<font color='blue'><b>informer</b></font>) got prosecutions for
murder and sadistic practice, it was a strange justice. Above all, it made the camp
personnel close ranks and dispose of living evidence. So the men of Bureau V did not
question Helen about her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) injuries. They stuck to embezzlement, and in the end stopped
troubling her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>). They investigated Mietek Pemper too.
He (<font color='blue'><b>informer</b></font>) was wise enough not to tell them much about Amon, certainly not about his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) crimes
against humans. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) knew little but rumors of Amon's frauds.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) played the neutral and well-mannered
typist of nonclassified material. <div class="bookquote">``The
Herr Commandant would never discuss such matters
with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) pleaded continually. But beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
performance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) must have suffered the same howling
disbelief as Helen Hirsch. If there was one
event most likely to guarantee him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) a chance
of life, it was Amon's arrest. For there
had been no more certain limit to his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
life than this: that when the Russians reached Tarnow, Amon would dictate his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) last letters
and then assassinate the typist. What worried Mietek, therefore, was that they would
release Amon too soon.
But they were not interested solely in the question of
Amon's speculations. The SS judge who
questioned Pemper had been told
by Oberscharf@uhrer Lorenz Landsdorfer that
Hauptsturmf@uhrer Goeth had let his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenz</b></font>)
Jewish stenographer type up the directives
and plans to be followed by the P@lasz@ow
garrison in the case of an assault on the
camp by partisans. Amon, in explaining
to Pemper how the typing of these plans should be set out, had even shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) copies of
similar plans for other concentration camps. The judge was so alarmed by this disclosure
of secret documents to a Jewish prisoner that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) ordered Pemper's arrest.
Pemper spent two miserable weeks in a cell beneath the SS barracks. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was not beaten,
but was questioned regularly by a series of Bureau V investigators and by two SS judges.
He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could read in their eyes the conclusion that the safest thing was to shoot
him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>). One day during questioning about P@lasz@ow's emergency plans, Pemper asked
his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) interrogators, <div class="bookquote">``Why keep me here? A prison is a prison. I have a life sentence
anyhow.''  (<font color='red'><b>interrogators</b></font>)</div>It was an argument calculated to bring a resolution, either release from the cells
or else a bullet. After the session ended, Pemper spent some hours of anxiety until his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) cell
door opened again. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was marched out and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hut in the camp. It was not
the last time, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would be questioned on subjects relating to Commandant
Goeth. It seemed that following his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) arrest, Amon's juniors did not rush to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
references. They were careful. They waited. Bosch, who'd drunk so much of the
Commandant's liquor, told Untersturmf@uhrer John that it was dangerous to try to bribe
these determined investigators from Bureau V. As for Amon's seniors, Scherner was
gone, assigned to hunting partisans, and would in the end be killed in an ambush in the
forests of Niepolomice. Amon was in the hands of men from Oranienburg who'd never
dined at the Goethhaus--or, if they had, had been either shocked or touched by envy.
After her (<font color='blue'><b>partisans</b></font>) release by the SS, Helen Hirsch, now working for the new Commandant,
Hauptsturmf@uhrer B@uscher, received a friendly note from Amon asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) to get
together a parcel of clothes, some romances and detective novels, and some liquor to
comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) cell. It was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) thought, like a letter from a relative. <div class="bookquote">``Would you
kindly gather for me the following,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it said, and ended with <div class="bookquote">``Hoping to see you again
soon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Meanwhile Oskar had been down to the market city of Troppau to see engineer
Sussmuth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d brought along liquor and diamonds, but they weren't needed in this
case. Sussmuth told Oskar that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had already proposed that some small Jewish work
camps be set up in the border towns of Moravia to turn out goods for the Armaments
Inspectorate. Such camps would, of course, be under the central control of either
Auschwitz or Gr@oss-Rosen, for the areas of influence of the big concentration camps
crossed the Polish-Czechoslovak border. But there was more safety for prisoners in little
work camps than could be found in the grand necropolis of Auschwitz itself. Sussmuth
had got nowhere, of course. The Castle at Liberec had trampled on the proposal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had
never had a lever. Oskar-- the support Oskar had from Colonel Lange and the gentlemen
of the Evacuation Board--that could be the lever.
Sussmuth had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) office a list of sites suitable to receive plants evacuated from the war
zone. Near Oskar's hometown of Zwittau, on the edge of a village called Brinnlitz, was a
great textile plant owned by the Viennese brothers Hoffman. They'd been in butter and
cheese in their home city, but had come to the Sudetenland behind the legions -LRB-just as
Oskar had gone to Cracow-RRB- and become textile magnates. An entire annex of their plant
lay idle, used as a storehouse for obsolete spinning machines. A site like that was served
from the rail depot at Zwittau, where Schindler's brother-in-law was in charge of the
freight yard. And a railway loop ran close to the gates. The brothers are profiteers, said
Sussmuth, smiling. They have some local party backing--the County Council and the
District Leader are in their pockets. But you have Colonel Lange behind you.
I will write to Berlin at once,
Sussmuth promised, and recommend the use of the Hoffman annex.
Oskar knew the Germanic village of
Brinnlitz from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) childhood. Its racial character was in its name, since the Czechs would
have called it Brnenec, just as a Czech Zwittau would have become Zvitava. The
Brinnlitz citizens would not fancy a thousand or more Jews in their neighborhood. The
Zwittau people, from whom some of Hoffman's workers were recruited, would not like it
either, this contamination, so late in the war, of their rustic-industrial backwater.
In any case, Oskar drove down to take a quick look at the site. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) did not approach
Hoffman Brothers' front office, since that would give the tougher Hoffman brother, the
one who chaired the company, too much warning. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hoffman</b></font>) was able to wander into the
annex without being challenged. It was an old-fashioned two-story industrial barracks
built around a courtyard. The ground floor was high-ceilinged and full of old machines
and crates of wool. The upper floor must have been intended as offices and for lighter
equipment. Its floor would not stand the weight of the big pressing machines. Downstairs
would do for the new workshops of DEF, as offices and, in one corner, the Herr
Direktor's apartment. Upstairs would be barracks for the prisoners.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hoffman</b></font>) was delighted with the place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hoffman</b></font>) drove
back to Cracow yearning to get started, to spend the
necessary money, to talk to Madritsch again. For
Sussmuth could find a site for Madritsch too
--perhaps even floor space in Brinnlitz.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) got back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) found that an Allied bomber, shot down by a Luftwaffe fighter, had
crashed on the two end barracks in the backyard prison. Its blackened fuselage sat
crookedly across the wreckage of the flattened huts. Only a small squad of prisoners had
been left behind in Emalia to wind up production and maintain the plant. They had seen it
come down, flaming. There had been two men inside, and their bodies had burned. The
Luftwaffe people who came to take them away had told Adam Garde that the bomber
was a Stirling and that the men were Australian. One, who was holding the charred
remnants of an English Bible, must have crashed with it in his (<font color='blue'><b>bomber</b></font>) hand. Two others had
parachuted in the suburbs. One had been found, dead of wounds, still in his (<font color='blue'><b>bomber</b></font>) harness. The
partisans had got to the other one first and were hiding him (<font color='blue'><b>bomber</b></font>) somewhere.
What these Australians had been doing was
dropping supplies to the partisans in the
primeval forest east of Cracow.
If Oskar had wanted some sort of
confirmation, this was it. That men should come all this way from unimaginable little
towns in the Australian Outback to hasten the end in Cracow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) put a call through at
once to the official in charge of rolling stock in the office of Ostbahn President Gerteis
and invited him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) to dinner to talk about DEF'S potential need of flatcars.
A week after Oskar spoke to Sussmuth, the
gentlemen of the Berlin Armaments Board instructed
the Governor of Moravia that Oskar's armaments
company was to be allocated the annex of
Hoffman's spinning mill in Brinnlitz. The
Governor's bureaucrats could do nothing more,
Sussmuth told Oskar by telephone, than slow
the paperwork down. But Hoffman and other Party men
in the Zwittau area were already conferring and passing
resolutions against Oskar's intrusion
into Moravia. The Party Kreisleiter in
Zwittau wrote to Berlin complaining that Jewish prisoners from Poland would be a peril
to the health of Moravian Germans. Spotted fever would very likely appear in the region
for the first time in modern history, and Oskar's small armaments factory, of dubious
value to the war effort, would also attract Allied bombers, with resultant damage to the
important Hoffman mills. The population of Jewish criminals in the proposed Schindler
camp would outweigh the small and decent population of Brinnlitz and be a cancer on the
honest flank of Zwittau.
A protest of that kind didn't have a chance, since it went straight to the office of Erich
Lange in Berlin. Appeals to Troppau were quashed by honest Sussmuth. Nonetheless, the
posters went up on walls in Oskar's hometown:
<div class="bookquote">``KEEP THE JEWISH CRIMINALS OU.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>And Oskar was paying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was paying the
Evacuation Committee in Cracow to help speed
up the permits for the transfer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) machinery. The
Department of the Economy in Cracow had to be
encouraged to provide the clearances of bank
holdings. Currency wasn't favored these days,
so he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) paid in goods--in kilos of tea,
in pairs of leather shoes, in carpets, in
coffee, in canned fish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) afternoons in the little streets off the market square of
Cracow haggling at staggering prices for whatever the bureaucrats desired. Otherwise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
was sure, they would keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) waiting till his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) last Jew had gone to Auschwitz.
It was Sussmuth who told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) that people from
Zwittau were writing to the Armaments
Inspectorate accusing Oskar of
black-marketeering. If they're writing to me, said Sussmuth, you can bet the same letters
are going to the police chief of Moravia, Obersturmf@uhrer Otto Rasch. You should
introduce yourself to Rasch and show him (<font color='blue'><b>Rasch</b></font>) what a charming fellow you are.
Oskar had known Rasch when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was SS
police chief of Katowice. Rasch was,
by happy chance, a friend of the chairman of Ferrum
AG at Sosnowiec, from which Oskar had bought his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
steel. But in rushing down to Brno to head off
informers, Oskar didn't rely on anything as
flimsy as mutual friendships. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) took a
diamond cut in the brilliant style which,
somehow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) introduced into the meeting. When it crossed the table and ended on
Rasch's side of the desk, it secured Oskar's Brno front.
Oskar later estimated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) spent
100,000 RM.--NEARLY $40,000--to grease the transfer to Brinnlitz. Few of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
survivors would ever find the figure unlikely, though there were those who shook their
heads and said, <div class="bookquote">``No, more! It would have to have been more than that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>survivors</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had drawn up what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) called a
preparatory list and delivered it to the
Administration Building. There were more than a thousand names on it--the names of all
the prisoners of the backyard prison camp of Emalia, as well as new names. Helen
Hirsch's name was freshly on the list, and Amon was not there to argue about it. And the
list would expand if Madritsch agreed to go to Moravia with Oskar. So Oskar kept
working on Titsch, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) ally at Julius Madritsch's ear. Those Madritsch prisoners who
were closest to Titsch knew the list was under compilation, that they could have access to
it. Titsch told them without any ambiguity: You must get on it. In all the reams of
P@lasz@ow paperwork, Oskar's dozen pages of names were the only pages with access
to the future.
But Madritsch still could not decide whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) wanted an alliance with Oskar, whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would add his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) 3,000 to the total.
There is again a haziness suitable to a legend about the precise chronology of Oskar's
list. The haziness doesn't attach to the existence of the list--a copy can be seen today in
the archives of the Yad Vashem. There is no uncertainty as we shall see about the names
remembered by Oskar and Titsch at the last minute and attached to the end of the official
paper. The names on the list are definite. But the circumstances encourage legends. The
problem is that the list is remembered with an intensity which, by its very heat, blurs. The
list is an absolute good. The list is life. All around its cramped margins lies the gulf.
Some of those whose names appeared on the list say
that there was a party at Goeth's villa, a
reunion of SS men and entrepreneurs
to celebrate the times they'd had there. Some even believe that Goeth was there, but since
the SS did not release on bail, that is impossible. Others believe that the party was held at
Oskar's own apartment above his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) factory. Oskar had for more than two years given
excellent parties there. One Emalia prisoner remembers the early hours of 1944 when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
was on night watch duty and Oskar had wandered down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) apartment at one
o'clock, escaping the noise upstairs and bringing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) two cakes, two hundred
cigarettes, and a bottle for his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) friend the watchman.
At the P@lasz@ow graduation party, wherever it took place, the guests included Dr.
Blancke, Franz Bosch, and, by some
reports, Oberf@uhrer Julian Scherner,
on vacation from his (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) partisan-hunting. Madritsch was there too, and Titsch. Titsch would
later say that at it Madritsch informed Oskar for the first time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would not be going
to Moravia with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I've done everything I can for the Jews,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madritsch/Julius Madritsch/Julius</b></font>)</div>Madritsch told him (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>). It
was a reasonable claim; he (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) would not be persuaded although he (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) said Titsch had been at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) for days.
Madritsch was a just man. Later he (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) would be honored as such. He (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) simply did not believe
that Moravia would work. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) had, the indications are that he (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) would have attempted it.
What else is known about the party is that an urgency operated there, because the
Schindler list had to be handed in that evening. This is an element in all the versions of
the story survivors tell. The survivors could tell and expand upon it only if they had heard
it in the first place from Oskar, a man with a taste for embellishing a story. But in the
early 1960's, Titsch himself attested to the substantial truth of this one. Perhaps the new
and temporary Commandant of P@lasz@ow, a Hauptsturmf@uhrer B@uscher, had said
to Oskar, <div class="bookquote">``Enough fooling around, Oskar! We have to finalize the paperwork and the
transportation.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Perhaps there was some other form of deadline imposed by the Ostbahn,
by the availability of transport. At the end of Oskar's list, therefore, Titsch now typed in,
above the official signatures, the names of Madritsch prisoners. Almost seventy names
were added, written in by Titsch from his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) own and Oskar's memories. Among them were
those of the Feigenbaum family--the adolescent daughter who suffered from incurable
bone cancer; the teen-age son Lutek with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lutek</b></font>) shaky expertise in repairing sewing
machines. Now they were all transformed, as Titsch scribbled, into skilled munitions
workers. There was singing in the apartment, loud talk and laughter, a fog of cigarette
smoke, and, in a corner, Oskar and Titsch quizzing each other over people's names,
straining for a clue to the spelling of Polish patronyms.
In the end, Oskar had to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) hand on
Titsch's wrist. We're over the limit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
said. They'll balk at the number we already have. Titsch continued to strain for names,
and tomorrow morning would wake damning himself because one had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) too
late. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was at the limit, wrung out by this work. It was blasphemously close to
creating people anew just by thinking of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) did not begrudge doing it. It was what
it said of the world--that was what made the heavy air of Schindler's apartment so hard
for Titsch to breathe.
The list was vulnerable, however, through the personnel clerk, Marcel Goldberg.
B@uscher, the new Commandant, who was there merely
to wind the camp down, himself could not have cared, within
certain numerical limits, who went on the
list. Therefore Goldberg had the power to tinker with
its edges. It was known to prisoners already that
Goldberg would take bribes. The Dresners
knew it. Juda Dresner--uncle of red
Genia, husband of the Mrs. Dresner
who'd once been refused a hiding place in a wall, and father of Janek and of young
Danka--
Juda Dresner knew it. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) paid
Goldberg,''  (<font color='red'><b>the family</b></font>)</div>the family would simply say
to explain how they got on the Schindler list. They never knew what was given. Wulkan
the jeweler presumably got himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>jeweler</b></font>) wife, his (<font color='blue'><b>jeweler</b></font>) son on the list in the same way.
Poldek Pfefferberg was told about the list by an SS NCO named Hans Schreiber.
Schreiber, a young man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>) mid-twenties, had as evil a name as any other SS man in
P@lasz@ow, but Pfefferberg had become something of a mild favorite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>) in that way
that was common to relationships--throughout the system--between individual prisoners
and SS personnel. It had begun one day when Pfefferberg, as a group leader in his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>)
barracks, had had responsibility for window cleaning. Schreiber inspected the glass and
found a smudge, and began browbeating Poldek in the style that was often a prelude to
execution. Pfefferberg lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>) temper and told Schreiber that both of them knew the
windows were perfectly polished and if Schreiber wanted a reason to shoot him (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>) ought
to do it without any more delay.
The outburst had, in a contradictory way,
amused Schreiber, who afterward occasionally used
to stop Pfefferberg and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>) wife
were, and sometimes even gave Poldek an apple
for Mila. In the summer of 1944, Poldek
had appealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>) desperately to extricate
Mila from a trainload of women being sent from
P@lasz@ow to the evil camp at Stutthof on
the Baltic. Mila was already in the lines boarding
the cattle cars when Schreiber came waving a
piece of paper and calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) name. Another time,
a Sunday, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>) turned up drunk at
Pfefferberg's barracks and, in front of
Poldek and a few other prisoners, began
to weep for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">``the dreadful things''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>) had done in P@lasz@ow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>)
intended, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>) said, to expiate them on the Eastern Front. In the end, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>) would.
Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>) told Poldek that Schindler had a list and that Poldek should do everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
could to get on it. Poldek went down to the Administration Building to beg Goldberg to
add his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) name and Mila's to the list. Schindler had in the past year and a half often visited
Poldek in the camp garage and had always promised rescue.
Poldek had, however, become such an
accomplished welder that the garage supervisors,
who needed for their lives' sake to produce
high-standard work, would never let him (<font color='blue'><b>welder</b></font>) go. Now
Goldberg sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) hand on the list--he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) had
already added his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) own name to it--and this old friend of
Oskar's, once a frequent guest in the apartment
in Straszewskiego, expected to have himself
written down for sentiment's sake. <div class="bookquote">``Do you have
any diamonds?''  (<font color='red'><b>Goldberg/Marcel Goldberg</b></font>)</div>Goldberg asked
Pfefferberg.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you serious?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Poldek.
<div class="bookquote">``For this list,''  (<font color='red'><b>Goldberg/Marcel Goldberg</b></font>)</div>said Goldberg, a man of
prodigious and accidental power, <div class="bookquote">``it takes diamonds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>Now that the Viennese music lover Hauptsturmf@uhrer Goeth was in prison, the Rosner
brothers, musicians to the court, were free to work their way onto the list. Dolek
Horowitz also, who had earlier got his (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) wife and children out to Emalia, now persuaded
Goldberg to include him (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) wife, his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) son, his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) young daughter. Horowitz had always
worked in the central warehouse of P@lasz@ow and had managed to put some small
treasure away. Now it was paid to Marcel Goldberg.
Among those included in the list were the Bejski brothers, Uri and Moshe, officially
described as machine fitter and draftsman. Uri had a knowledge of weapons, and Moshe a
gift for forging documents. The circumstances of the list are so clouded that it is not
possible to say whether they were included for these talents or not.
Josef Bau, the ceremonious bridegroom, would at some stage be included, but without his (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>)
knowing it. It suited Goldberg to keep everyone in the dark about the list. Given his (<font color='blue'><b>Bau</b></font>)
nature, it is possible to assume that if Bau made any personal approach to Goldberg it
could only have been on the basis that his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) mother, his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) wife, himself should all be
included. He (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) would not find out until too late that he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) alone would be listed for Brinnlitz.
As for Stern, the Herr Direktor had included him (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) from the beginning. Stern was the only
father confessor Oskar ever had, and Stern's suggestions had a great authority with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>).
Since October 1, no Jewish prisoner had been allowed out of P@lasz@ow either to
march to the cable factory or for any other purpose. At the same time, the trusties in the
Polish prison had begun to put guards on the barracks to stop Jewish prisoners from
trading with the Poles for bread. The price of illegal bread reached a level it would be
hard to express in z@loty. In the past you could have bought a loaf for your second coat,
250 gm. for a clean undershirt. Now--as with Goldberg--it took diamonds.
During the first week of October, Oskar and Bankier visited P@lasz@ow for some
reason and went as usual to see Stern in the Construction Office. Stern's desk was down
the hallway from the vanished Amon's office. It was possible to speak more freely here
than ever before. Stern told Schindler about the inflated price of rye bread.
Oskar turned to Bankier. <div class="bookquote">``Make sure
Weichert gets fifty thousand z@loty,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>murmured Oskar.
Dr. Michael Weichert was chairman of the former Jewish Communal Self-Help, now
renamed Jewish Relief Office. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) office were permitted to operate for cosmetic
reasons and, in part, because of Weichert's powerful connections in the German Red
Cross. Though many Polish Jews within the camps would treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) with understandable
suspicion, and though this suspicion would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) to trial after the war--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) would be
exonerated--Weichert was exactly the man to find 50,000 z@l. worth of bread quickly
and introduce it into P@lasz@ow.
The conversation of Stern and Oskar moved on. The 50,000 z@loty were a mere obiter
dicta of their talk about the unsettled times and about how Amon might be enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
cell in Breslau. Later in the week black-market bread from town was smuggled into
camp hidden beneath cargoes of cloth, coal, or scrap iron. Within a day, the price had
fallen to its accustomed level.
It was a nice case of connivance between Oskar and Stern, and would be followed by
other instances.

<p/>CHAPTER 32
At least one of the Emalia people crossed off by Goldberg to make room for others--for
relatives, Zionists, specialists, or payers--would blame Oskar for it.
In 1963, the Martin Buber Society would receive a pitiable letter from a New Yorker, a
former Emalia prisoner. In Emalia, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said, Oskar had promised deliverance. In return,
the people had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wealthy with their labor. Yet some found themselves off the
edge of the list. This man saw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own omission as a very personal betrayal and--with all
the fury of someone who has been made to travel through the flames to pay for another
man's lie--blamed Oskar for all that had happened afterward: for Gr@oss-Rosen, and for
the frightful cliff at Mauthausen from which prisoners were thrown, and last of all for the
death march with which the war would end. Strangely, the letter, radiant with just anger,
shows most graphically that life on the list was a feasible matter, while life off it was
unutterable. But it seems unjust to condemn Oskar for Goldberg's fiddling with names.
The camp authorities would, in the chaos of those last days, sign any list Goldberg gave
them as long as it did not exceed too drastically the 1,100 prisoners Oskar had been
granted. Oskar himself could not police Goldberg by the hour. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) own day was spent
speaking to bureaucrats, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) evenings in buttering them up.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had, for example, to receive shipment authorizations for his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) Hilo machines and metal
presses from old friends in the office of General Schindler, some of whom delayed the
paperwork, finding small problems which could confound the idea of Oskar's salvage of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) 1,100.
One of these Inspectorate men had raised the problem that Oskar's armament machines
had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) by way of the procurement section of the Berlin Inspectorate, and under
approval from its licensing section, specifically for use in Poland. Neither of these
sections had been notified of the proposed move to Moravia. They would need to be. It
could be a month before they gave their authorization. Oskar did not have a month.
P@lasz@ow would be empty by the end of October;
everyone would be in Gr@oss-Rosen or
Auschwitz. In the end, the problem was
cleared away by the accustomed gifts.
As well as such preoccupations, Oskar was concerned about the SS investigators who had
arrested Amon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) half-expected to be arrested or--which was the same thing--heavily
interrogated about his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) relationship with the former Commandant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was wise to
anticipate it, for one of the explanations Amon had offered for the 80,000 RM. the SS had
found among his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) belongings was <div class="bookquote">``Oskar Schindler gave it to me so I'd go easy on the
Jews.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar therefore had to keep in contact with friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) at Pomorska Street who
might be able to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) the direction Bureau V's investigation of Amon was taking.
Finally, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) camp at Brinnlitz would be under the ultimate supervision of KL
Gr@oss-Rosen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was already dealing with the Commandant of Gr@oss-Rosen,
Sturmbannf@uhrer Hassebroeck. Under Hassebroeck's management, 100,000 would die
in the Gr@oss-Rosen system, but when Oskar conferred with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) on the telephone and
drove across into Lower Silesia to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) seemed the least of all Oskar's worries.
Schindler was used by now to meeting charming killers and noticed that Hassebroeck
even seemed grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) for extending the Gr@oss-Rosen empire into Moravia. For
Hassebroeck did think in terms of empire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) controlled one hundred and three
subcamps. -LRB-brinnlitz would be one hundred and four and--with its more than 1,000
inmates and its sophisticated industry--a major addition.-RRB- Seventy-eight of
Hassebroeck's camps were located in Poland, sixteen in Czechoslovakia, ten in the
Reich. It was much bigger cheese than anything Amon had managed.
With so much sweetening, cajoling, and form-filling to occupy him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) in the week
P@lasz@ow was wound down, Oskar could not have found the time to monitor
Goldberg, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had had the power. In any case, the account the prisoners give of the
camp in its last day and night is one of milling and chaos, Goldberg--Lord of the Lists--
at its center, still holding out for offers.
Dr. Idek Schindel, for example, approached Goldberg to get himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) two young
brothers into Brinnlitz. Goldberg would not give an answer, and Schindel would not find
out until the evening of October 15, when the male prisoners were marshaled for the
cattle cars, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) brothers were not listed for the Schindler camp. They joined
the line of Schindler people anyway. It is a scene from a cautionary engraving of
Judgment Day--the ones without the right mark attempting to creep onto the line of the
justified and being spotted by an angel of retribution, in this case Oberscharf@uhrer
M`uller, who came up to the doctor with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) whip and slapped him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), left cheek, right
cheek, left and right again with the leather butt, while asking amusedly, <div class="bookquote">``Why would you
want to get on that line?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Schindel would be made to stay on with the small
party involved in liquidating P@lasz@ow and would
then travel with a carload of sick women
to Auschwitz. They would be placed in a hut in
some corner of Birkenau and left to die. Yet
most of them, overlooked by camp officials and
exempt from the usual regimen of the place, would
live. Schindel himself would be sent
to Flossenburg and then--with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) brothers--on a
death march. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would survive by a layer of skin,
but the youngest Schindel boy would be shot on the march
on the next-to-last day of the war. That is an
image of the way the Schindler list, without any
malice on Oskar's side, with adequate
malice on Goldberg's, still tantalizes
survivors, and tantalized them in those
desperate October days.
Everyone has a story about the list. Henry
Rosner lined up with the Schindler people, but an NCO
spotted his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) violin and, knowing that Amon would
require music should he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) be released from prison,
sent Rosner back. Rosner then hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) violin
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) coat, against his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) side, tucking the node of the
sound post under his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) armpit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) lined up again and was
let through to the Schindler cars. Rosner had been
one of those to whom Oskar had made promises, and
so had always been on the list. It was the same with the
Jereths: old Mr. Jereth of the box factory
and Mrs. Chaja Jereth, described in the list
inexactly and hopefully as a
Metallarbeiterin--a metalworker. The
Perlmans were also on as old Emalia hands, and the Levartovs as well. In fact, in spite of
Goldberg, Oskar got for the most part the people he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had asked for, though there may have
been some surprises among them. A man as worldly as Oskar could not have been
amazed to find Goldberg himself among the inhabitants of Brinnlitz.
But there were more welcome additions than that. Poldek Pfefferberg, for example,
accidentally overlooked and rejected by Goldberg for lack of diamonds, let it be known
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) wanted to buy vodka--he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) could pay in clothing or bread. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>)'d acquired the
bottle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) got permission to take it down to the orderly building in Jerozolimska where
Schreiber was on duty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>) gave Schreiber the bottle and pleaded with him (<font color='blue'><b>Schreiber</b></font>) to force
Goldberg to include Mila and himself. <div class="bookquote">``Schindler,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``would have written us
down if he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d remembered.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Poldek had no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) was negotiating for his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) life.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Schreiber</b></font>)</div>Schreiber agreed. <div class="bookquote">``The two of you must get on it.''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>It is a human puzzle why men
like Schreiber didn't in such moments ask themselves, If this man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife were
worth saving, why weren't the rest?
The Pfefferbergs would find themselves on the Schindler line when the time came. And
so, to their surprise, would Helen Hirsch and the younger sister whose survival had
always been Helen's own obsession.
The men of the Schindler list entrained at the P@lasz@ow siding on a Sunday, October
15. It would be another full week before the women left. Though the 800 were kept
separate during the loading of the train and were pushed into freight cars kept exclusively
for Schindler personnel, they were coupled to cars containing 1,300 other prisoners all
bound for Gr@oss-Rosen. It seems that some half-expected to have to pass through
Gr@oss-Rosen on their way to Schindler's camp; but many others believed that the
journey would be direct. They were prepared to endure a slow trip to Moravia--they
accepted that they would be made to spend time sitting in the cars at junctions and on
sidings. They might wait half a day at a time for traffic with higher priority to pass. The
first snow had fallen in the last week, and it would be cold. Each prisoner had been issued
only 300 gm. of bread to last the journey, and each car had been provided with a single
water bucket. For their natural functions, the travelers would have to use a corner of the
floor, or if packed too tightly, urinate and defecate where they stood. But in the end,
despite all their griefs they would tumble out at a Schindler establishment.
The 300 women of the list would enter the cars the following Sunday in the same
sanguine state of mind.
Other prisoners noticed that Goldberg traveled as lightly as any of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) must have
had contacts outside P@lasz@ow to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) diamonds for him (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>). Those who still hoped to
influence him (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) on behalf of an uncle, a brother, a sister allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) enough space to sit in
comfort. The others squatted, their knees pushed into their chins. Dolek Horowitz held
six-year-old Richard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) arms. Henry Rosner made a nest of clothing on the floor for
nine-year-old Olek.
It took three days. Sometimes, at sidings, their breath froze on the walls. Air was always
scarce, but when you got a mouthful it was icy and fetid. The train halted at last on the
dusk of a comfortless autumn day. The doors were unlocked, and passengers were
expected to alight as quickly as businessmen with appointments to keep. SS guards ran
among them shouting directions and blaming them for smelling. <div class="bookquote">``Take everything off!''
 (<font color='red'><b>NCO</b></font>)</div>the NCO'S were roaring. <div class="bookquote">``Everything for disinfection!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They piled their clothing and
marched naked into the camp. By six in the evening they stood in naked lines on the
Appellplatz of this bitter destination. Snow stood in the surrounding woods; the surface
of the parade ground was iced. It was not a Schindler camp. It was Gr@oss-Rosen. Those
who had paid Goldberg glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>), threatening murder, while SS men in overcoats
walked along the lines, lashing the buttocks of those who openly shivered.
They kept the men on the Appellplatz all night, for there were no huts available. It was
not until midmorning the next day that they would be put under cover. In speaking of that
seventeen hours of exposure, of ineffable cold dragging down on the heart, survivors do
not mention any deaths.
Perhaps life under the SS, or even at
Emalia, had tempered them for a night like this one. Though it was a milder evening than
those earlier in the week, it was still murderous enough. Some of them, of course, were
too distracted by the possibility of Brinnlitz to drift away with cold.
Later, Oskar would meet prisoners who had survived an even longer exposure to cold and
frostbite. Certainly elderly Mr. Garde, the father of Adam Garde, lived through this night,
as did little Olek Rosner and Richard Horowitz.
Toward eleven o'clock the next morning, they were taken to the showers. Poldek
Pfefferberg, crowded in with the others, considered the nozzle above his (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) head with
suspicion, wondering if water or gas would rain down. It was water; but before it was
turned on, Ukrainian barbers passed among them, shaving their heads, their pubic hair,
their armpits. You stood straight, eyes front, while the Ukrainian worked at you with his (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>)
unhoned razor. <div class="bookquote">``It's too dull,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoners</b></font>)</div>one of the prisoners complained. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div>said the
Ukrainian, and slashed the prisoner's leg to show that the blade still held a cutting edge.
After the showers, they were issued striped prison uniforms and crowded into barracks.
The SS sat them in lines, like galley oarsmen, one man backed up between the legs of the
man behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own opened legs affording support to the man in front. By this
method, 2,000 men were crammed into three huts. German Kapos armed with truncheons
sat on chairs against the wall and watched. Men were wedged so tightly--every inch of
the floor space covered--that to leave their rows for the latrines, even if the Kapos
permitted it, meant walking on heads and shoulders and being cursed for it.
In the middle of one hut was a kitchen where turnip soup was being made and bread
baked. Poldek Pfefferberg, coming back from a visit to the latrines, found the kitchen
under the supervision of a Polish Army NCO he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had known at the beginning of the war.
The NCO gave Poldek some bread and permitted him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) to sleep by the kitchen fire. The
others, however, spent their nights wedged in the human chain.
Each day they were stood at attention in the Appellplatz and remained there in silence for
ten hours. In the evenings, however, after the issue of thin soup, they were allowed to
walk around the hut, to talk to each other. The blast of a whistle at 9 P.m. was the signal
for them to take up their curious positions for the night.
On the second day, an SS officer came
to the Appellplatz looking for the clerk who had
drawn up the Schindler list. It had not been
sent off from P@lasz@ow, it seemed. Shivering in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) coarse prison uniform, Goldberg was led off
to an office and asked to type out the list
from memory. By the end of the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) had not finished the
work and, back in the barracks, was surrounded by a
spate of final pleas for inclusion. Here, in the
bitter dusk, the list still enticed and tormented,
even if all it had done so far for those on it was
bring them to Gr@oss-Rosen. Pemper and others,
moving in on Goldberg, began to pressure him (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>)
to type Dr. Alexander Biberstein's name on the
sheet in the morning. Biberstein was brother of the
Marek Biberstein who had been that first,
optimistic president of the Cracow
Judenrat. Earlier in the week Goldberg
had confused Biberstein, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) was on the list. It was not till the trucks were
loaded that the doctor found out he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was not in the Schindler group. Even in such a place
as Gr@oss-Rosen, Mietek Pemper was sure enough of a future to threaten Goldberg with
postwar reprisals if Biberstein were not added.
Then, on the third day, the 800 men of Schindler's now revised list were separated out;
taken to the delousing station for yet another wash; permitted to sit a few hours,
speculating and chatting like villagers in front of their huts; and marched out once more
to the siding. With a small ration of bread, they climbed up into cattle cars. None of the
guards who loaded them admitted to knowing where they were going. They squatted on
the floorboards in the prescribed manner. They kept fixed in their minds the map of
Central Europe, and made continual judgments about the passage of the sun, gauging
their direction by glimpses of light through small wire ventilators near the roofs of the
cars. Olek Rosner was lifted to the ventilator in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) car and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) could see forests
and mountains. The navigation experts claimed the train was traveling generally
southeast. It all indicated a Czech destination, but no one wanted to say so.
This journey of a hundred miles took nearly
two days; when the doors opened, it was early
morning on the second day. They were at the
Zwittau depot. They dismounted and were marched through
a town not yet awake, a town frozen in the
late Thirties. Even the graffiti on the
walls--<div class="bookquote">``KEEP THE JEWS OUT OF
BRINNLITZ'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--LOOKED strangely prewar to them. They had been living in a world
where their very breath was begrudged. It seemed almost endearingly naive for the
people of Zwittau to begrudge them a mere location. Three or four miles out into the
hills, following a rail siding, they came to the industrial hamlet of Brinnlitz, and saw
ahead in thin morning light the solid bulk of the Hoffman annex transformed into
Arbeitslager -LRB-labor Camp-RRB-
Brinnlitz, with watchtowers, a wire fence encircling it, a guard barracks inside the wire,
and beyond that the gate to the factory and the prisoners' dormitories.
As they marched in through the outer gate, Oskar appeared from the factory courtyard,
wearing a Tyrolean hat.

<p/>CHAPTER 33
This camp, like Emalia, had been equipped at Oskar's expense. According to the
bureaucratic theory, all factory camps were built at the owner's cost. It was thought that
any industrialist got sufficient incentive from the cheap prison labor to justify a small
expenditure on wire and lumber. In fact, Germany's darling industrialists, such as Krupp
and Farben, built their camps with materials donated from SS enterprises andwitha
wealth of labor lent to them. Oskar was no darling and got nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had been able to
pry some wagonloads of SS cement out of Bosch at what Bosch would have considered a
discount black-market price. From the same source he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) got two to three tons of gasoline
and fuel oil for use in the production and delivery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) goods. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) had brought some of
the camp fencing wire from Emalia.
But around the bare premises of the Hoffman annex, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hoffman</b></font>) was required to provide hightension
fences, latrines, a guard barracks for 100 SS personnel, attached SS offices, a
sickroom, and kitchens. Adding to the expense, Sturmbannf@uhrer Hassebroeck had
already been down from Gr@oss-Rosen for an inspection and gone away with a supply
of cognac and porcelainware, and what Oskar described as <div class="bookquote">``tea by the kilogram.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Hassebroeck had also taken away inspection fees and compulsory Winter Aid
contributions levied by Section D, and no receipt had been given. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) car had a
considerable capacity for these things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar would later declare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had no doubt in
October 1944 that Hassebroeck was already doctoring the Brinnlitz books.
Inspectors sent directly by Oranienburg had also to be satisfied. As for the goods and
equipment of DEF, much of it still in transit, it would require 250 freight cars before it
had all arrived. It was astounding, said Oskar, how in a crumbling state, Ostbahn officials
could, if properly encouraged, find such a number of rail cars.
And the unique aspect of all this, of Oskar himself, jaunty in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) mountain hat, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
emerged from that frosty courtyard, is that unlike Krupp and Farben and all the other
entrepreneurs who kept Jewish slaves, he (<font color='blue'><b>Krupp</b></font>) had no serious industrial intention at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Krupp</b></font>) had
no hopes of production; there were no sales graphs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Krupp</b></font>) head. Though four years ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Krupp</b></font>)
had come to Cracow to get rich, he (<font color='blue'><b>Krupp</b></font>) now had no manufacturing ambitions left.
It was a hectic industrial situation there in Brinnlitz. Many of the presses, drills, and
lathes had not yet arrived, and new cement floors would have to be poured to take their
weight. The annex was still full of Hoffman's old machinery. Even so, for these 800
supposed munitions workers who had just moved through the gate, Oskar was paying
7.50 RM. each day per skilled worker, 6 RM. per laborer. This would amount to nearly
$14,000 U.s. each week for male labor; when the women arrived, the bill would top
$18,000. Oskar was therefore committing a grand business folly, but celebrated it in a
Tyrolean hat.
Some of Oskar's attachments had shifted too. Mrs. Emilie Schindler had come from
Zwittau to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) downstairs apartment. Brinnlitz, unlike Cracow, was too
close to home to permit her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) to excuse their separation. For a Catholic like her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>), it was now
a matter of either formalizing the rift or living together again. There seemed to be at least
a tolerance between them, a thorough mutual respect. At first sight she (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) might have looked
like a marital cipher, an abused wife who did not know how to get out. Some of the men
wondered at first what she (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) would think when she (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) found the sort of factory Oskar kept, the
sort of camp. They did not know yet that Emilie would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) own discrete
contribution, that it would be based not on conjugal obedience but on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) own ideas.
Ingrid had come with Oskar to Brinnlitz to work in the new plant, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>) had taken
lodgings outside the camp and was there only for office hours. There was a definite
cooling in that relationship, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>) would never live with Oskar again. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>) would
show no animosity, and throughout the coming months Oskar would frequently visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>)
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>) apartment. The racy Klonowska, that chic Polish patriot, stayed behind in Cracow,
but again there was no apparent bitterness. Oskar would have contact with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>) during
visits to Cracow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>) would again help him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) when the SS caused trouble. The truth
was that though his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) attachments to Klonowska and Ingrid were winding down in the most
fortunate way, without any bitterness, it would have been a mistake to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was
turning conjugal.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) told the men, that day of their arrival, that the women could be confidently expected.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) believed they would arrive after scarcely more delay than there had been with the
men. The women's journey would, however, be different. After a short trip from
P@lasz@ow, their locomotive backed them, with some hundreds of other P@lasz@ow
women, through the arched gatehouse of Auschwitz-Birkenau. When the car doors
opened, they found themselves in that immense concourse bisecting the camp, and
practiced SS men and women, speaking calmly, began to grade them. The sorting of the
people went on with a terrifying detachment. When a woman was slow in moving, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was hit with a truncheon, but the blow had no personal edge to it. It was all a matter of
getting the numbers through. For the SS sections at the railside of Birkenau, it was all
dutiful tedium. They had already heard every plea, every story. They knew every dodge
anyone was ever likely to pull.
Under the floodlights, the women numbly asked each other what it meant. But even in
their daze, their shoes already filling with the mud that was Birkenau's element, they
were aware of SS women pointing to them, and telling uniformed doctors who showed
any interest, <div class="bookquote">``Schindlergruppe!''  (<font color='red'><b>doctors</b></font>)</div>And the spruce young physicians would turn away and
leave them alone for a time.
Feet sticking in the mud, they were marched to the delousing plant and stripped by order
of tough young SS women with truncheons in their hands. Mila Pfefferberg was troubled
by rumors of the type most prisoners of the Reich had by now heard--that some shower
nozzles gave out a killing gas.
These, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) was delighted to find, gave mere icy water.
After their wash, some of them expected to be tattooed. They knew as much as that about
Auschwitz. The SS tattooed your arm if they wanted to use you. If they intended to feed
you into the machine, however, they did not bother. The same train that had brought the
women of the list had brought also some 2,000 others who, not being Schindlerfrauen,
were put through the normal selections. Rebecca Bau, excluded from the Schindler list,
had passed and been given a number, and Josef Bau's robust mother had also won a
tattoo in that preposterous Birkenau lottery. Another P@lasz@ow girl, fifteen years old,
had looked at the tattoo she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d been given and been delighted that it had two fives, a three,
and two sevens--numbers enshrined in the Tashlag, or Jewish calendar. With a tattoo,
you could leave Birkenau and go to one of the Auschwitz labor camps, where there was
at least a chance.
But the Schindler women, left untattooed, were told to dress again and taken to a
windowless hut in the women's camp. There, in the center of the floor, stood a sheet-iron
stove housed in bricks. It was the only comfort. There were no bunks. The
Schindlerfrauen were to sleep two or three to a thin straw pallet. The clay floor was
damp, and water would rise from it like a tide and drench the pallets, the ragged blankets.
It was a death house at the heart of Birkenau. They lay there and dozed, frozen and
uneasy in that enormous acreage of mud.
It confounded their imaginings of an intimate
location, a village in Moravia. This was a
great, if ephemeral, city. On a given day more
than a quarter of a million Poles,
Gypsies, and Jews kept brief residence
here. There were thousands more over in Auschwitz I, the first but smaller camp where
Commandant Rudolf H@oss lived. And in the great industrial area named Auschwitz III,
some tens of thousands worked while they could. The Schindler women had not been
precisely informed of the statistics of Birkenau or of the Auschwitz duchy in itself. They
could see, though, beyond birch trees at the western end of the enormous settlement,
constant smoke rising from the four crematoria and the numerous pyres. They believed
they were adrift now, and that the tide would take them down there. But not with all the
capacity for making and believing rumors that characterizes a life in prison would they
have guessed how many people could be gassed there on a day when the system worked
well. The number was--according to H@oss--nine thousand. The women were equally
unaware that they had arrived in Auschwitz at a time when the progress of the war and
certain secret negotiations between Himmler and the Swedish Count Folke Bernadotte
were imposing a new direction on it. The secret of the extermination centers had not been
kept, for the Russians had excavated the Lublin camp and found the furnaces containing
human bones and more than five hundred drums of Zyklon B.
News of this was published throughout the world, and
Himmler, who wanted to be treated seriously as
obvious postwar successor to the F@uhrer, was
willing to make promises to the Allies that the
gassing of Jews would stop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Himmler</b></font>) did not, however,
issue an order on the matter until some time in
October--the date is not certain. One copy
went to General Pohl in Oranienburg; the
other, to Kaltenbrunner, Chief of Reich
Security. Both of them ignored the
directive, and so did Adolf Eichmann.
Jews from P@lasz@ow, Theresienstadt, and Italy continued to be gassed up to the
middle of November. The last selection for the gas chambers is believed, however, to
have been made on October 30.
For the first eight days of their stay in
Auschwitz, the Schindler women were in enormous danger of death by gassing. And
even after that, as the last victims of the chambers continued to file throughout November
toward the western end of Birkenau, and as the ovens and pyres worked on their backlog
of corpses, they would not be aware of any change in the essential nature of the camp. All
their anxieties would in any case be well founded, for most of those left after the gassing
ceased would be shot --as happened to all the crematorium workers--or allowed to die of
disease.
In any case, the Schindler women went through
frequent mass medical inspections in both
October and November. Some of them had been
separated out in the first days and sent off to the huts
reserved for the terminally ill. The doctors of
Auschwitz--Josef Mengele,
Fritz Klein, Doctors Konig and Thilo
--not only worked on the Birkenau platform but roamed the camp, turning up at roll calls,
invading the showers, asking with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``How old are you, Mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Doctors</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Clara
Sternberg found herself put aside in a hut for older women. Sixty-year-old Mrs. Lola
Krumholz was also cut out of the Schindlergruppe and put into a barracks for the aged
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lola</b></font>) was meant to die at no expense to the administration. Mrs. Horowitz,
believing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) fragile daughter of eleven years, Niusia, could not survive a
<div class="bookquote">``bathhouse''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter Niusia</b></font>)</div>inspection, hustled her (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) into an empty sauna boiler. One of the SS girls who'd
been appointed to the Schindler women--the pretty one, the blonde--saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) do it but
did not give her (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) was a puncher, that one, short-tempered, and later she (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) would
ask Mrs. Horowitz for a bribe and get a brooch which Regina had somehow concealed
till then. Regina handed it over philosophically. There was another, heavier, gentler one
who made lesbian advances and may have required a more personal payoff. Sometimes
at roll call, one or more of the doctors would appear in front of the barracks. Seeing the
medical gentlemen, women rubbed clay into their cheeks to induce a little bogus color.
At one such inspection, Regina found stones for her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) daughter, Niusia, to stand on, and
silver-haired young Mengele came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) a soft-voiced question concerning
her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) daughter's age and punched her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) for lying. Women felled like this at inspection were
meant to be picked up by the guards while still semiconscious, dragged to the electrified
fence at the edge of the women's camp, and thrown onto it. They had Regina halfway
there when she (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) revived and begged them not to fry her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) alive, to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) line.
They released her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>), and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) crept back into the ranks, there was her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) bird-boned,
speechless daughter still, frozen to the pile of stone. These inspections could occur at any
hour. The Schindler women were called out one night to stand in the mud while their
barracks was searched. Mrs.
Dresner, who had once been saved by a vanished
OD boy, came out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) tall teen-age
daughter, Danka. They stood there in that
eccentric mire of Auschwitz which, like the fabled
mud of Flanders, would not freeze when everything
else had frozen--the roads, the
rooftops, the human traveler.
Both Danka and Mrs. Dresner had left
P@lasz@ow in the summer clothing that was all they had left. Danka wore a blouse, a
light jacket, a maroon skirt. Since it had begun snowing earlier in the evening, Mrs.
Dresner had suggested that Danka tear a strip off her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) blanket and wear it beneath the
skirt. Now, in the course of the barracks inspection, the SS discovered the ripped blanket.
The officer who stood before the Schindler women called out the barracks Alteste--a
Dutch woman whom, until yesterday, none of them had known--and said that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was to
be shot, together with any other prisoner found with a blanket strip under her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress.
Mrs. Dresner began whispering to Danka.
<div class="bookquote">``Take it off and I'll slip it back into the
barracks.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was a credible idea. The
barracks stood at ground level and no step led up to them. A woman in the rear line might
slip backward through the door. As Danka had obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother once before in the
matter of the wall cavity in Dabrowski Street, Cracow, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now, slipping
from beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress that strip of Europe's poorest blanket. In fact, while Mrs. Dresner
was in the hut, the SS officer passed by and idly extracted a woman of Mrs. Dresner's
age--it was probably Mrs. Sternberg--and had her (<font color='blue'><b>Sternberg</b></font>) taken away to some worse part of the
camp, some place where there was no Moravian illusion.
Perhaps the other women in line did not let themselves understand what this simple act of
weeding out meant. It was in fact a statement that no reserved group of so-called
<div class="bookquote">``industrial prisoners''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was safe in Auschwitz. No cry of <div class="bookquote">``Schindlerfrauen!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>would keep
them immune for long. There had been other groups of <div class="bookquote">``industrial prisoners''  (<font color='red'><b>groups</b></font>)</div>who had
vanished in Auschwitz. General Pohl's Section W had sent some trainloads of skilled
Jewish workers from Berlin the year before. I. G. Farben had needed labor and was told
by Section W to select its workers from these transports. In fact, Section W had
suggested to Commandant H@oss that the trains should be unloaded in the I.
G. Farben works, not near the crematoria in
Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of 1,750
prisoners, all male, in the first
train, 1,000 were immediately gassed. Of 4,000 in the next four trainloads, 2,500 went at
once to the <div class="bookquote">``bathhouses.''  (<font color='red'><b>I. G. Farben/Farben</b></font>)</div>If the Auschwitz administration would not stay its hand for I.
G. Farben and Department W, it was not going to be finicky about the women of some
obscure German potmaker.
In barracks like those of the Schindler women, it was like living outdoors. The windows
had no glass and served only to put an edge on the blasts of cold air out of Russia. Most
of the girls had dysentery. Crippled with cramp, they limped in their clogs to the steel
waste drum out in the mud. The woman who tended it did so for an extra bowl of soup.
Mila Pfefferberg staggered out one evening, seized with dysentery, and the woman on
duty--not a bad woman, a woman Mila had known as a girl--insisted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) could not
use the drum but had to wait for the next girl out and then empty it with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) help. Mila
argued but could not shake the woman. Beneath the hungry stars this tending of the drum
had become something like a profession, and there were rules. With the drum as pretext,
the woman had come to believe that order, hygiene, sanity were possible.
The next girl out arrived at Mila's side, gasping and bent and desperate. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) too was
young and, in peaceful days in @l@od@z, had known the woman on the can as a
respectable married woman. So the two girls were obedient and lugged the thing 300
meters through the mud. The girl who shared the burden asked Mila, <div class="bookquote">``Where's Schindler
now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mila/Mila Pfefferberg</b></font>)</div>Not everyone in the barracks asked that question, or asked it in that fierce, ironic way.
There was an Emalia girl named Lusia, a widow of twenty-two, who kept saying, <div class="bookquote">``You'll
see, it will all come out. We'll end up somewhere warm with Schindler's soup in us.''  (<font color='red'><b>a widow</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
did not know herself why she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kept repeating such statements. In Emalia she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had never
been the type to make projections. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d worked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shift, drunk her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) soup, and slept. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had never predicted grandiose events. Sufficient to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) day had always been the survival
thereof. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was ill and there was no reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be prophetic. The cold and
hunger were wasting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) too bore the vast obsessions of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hunger. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
amazed herself by repeating Oskar's promises.
Later in their stay in Auschwitz, when they had been moved to a hut closer to the
crematoria and did not know if they were to go to the showers or the chambers, Lusia
continued pushing the glad message. Even so, the tide of the camp having washed them
to this geographic limit of the earth, this pole, this pit, despair wasn't quite the fashion for
the Schindlerfrauen. You would still find women huddled in recipe talk and dreams of
prewar kitchens.
In Brinnlitz when the men arrived, there was only the shell. There were no bunks yet;
straw was strewn in the dormitories upstairs. But it was warm, with steam heat from the
boilers. There were no cooks that first day. Bags of turnips lay around what would be the
cookhouse, and men devoured them raw. Later, soup was brewed and bread baked, and
the engineer Finder began the allocating of jobs. But from the start, unless there were SS
men looking on, it was all slow. It is mysterious how a body of prisoners could sense that
the Herr Direktor was no longer a party to any war effort. The pace of work grew very
canny in Brinnlitz. Since Oskar was detached from the question of production, slow work
became the prisoners' vengeance, their declaration.
It was a heady thing to withhold your labor. Everywhere else in Europe, the slaves
worked to the limit of their 600 calories per day, hoping to impress some foreman and
delay the transfer to the death camp. But here in Brinnlitz was the intoxicating freedom to
use the shovel at half-pace and still survive.
None of this unconscious policy-making was evident in the first days. There were still too
many prisoners anxious for their women. Dolek Horowitz had a wife and daughter in
Auschwitz. The Rosner brothers had their wives. Pfefferberg knew the shock which
something as vast, as appalling as Auschwitz would have on Mila. Jacob Sternberg and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) teen-age son were concerned about Mrs. Clara Sternberg. Pfefferberg remembers the
men clustering around Schindler on the factory floor and asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) again where the
women were.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm getting them out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Schindler rumbled.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) did not go into explanations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) did not
publicly surmise that the SS in Auschwitz
might need to be bribed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) did not say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
had sent the list of women to Colonel
Erich Lange, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lange</b></font>) and Lange both
intended to get them to Brinnlitz according to the list.
Nothing of that. Simply <div class="bookquote">``I'm getting them out.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>The SS garrison who moved into
Brinnlitz in those days gave Oskar some cause to hope. They were middle-aged
reservists called up to allow younger SS men a place in the front line. There were not so
many lunatics as at P@lasz@ow, and Oskar would always keep them gentle with the
specialties of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) kitchen--plain food, but plenty. In a visit to their barracks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
usual speech about the unique skills of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) prisoners, the importance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) manufacturing
activities. Antitank shells, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said, and casings for a projectile still on the secret list. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
asked that there be no intrusion by the garrison into the factory itself, for that would
disturb the workers.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could see it in their eyes. It suited them, this quiet town. They could imagine
themselves lasting out the cataclysm here. They did not want to rampage round the
workshops like a Goeth or a Hujar. They didn't want the Herr Direktor to complain about
them.
Their commanding officer, however, had not yet arrived. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) way from his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
previous post, the labor camp at Budzyn, which had, until the recent Russian advances,
manufactured Heinkel bomber parts. He (<font color='blue'><b>bomber</b></font>) would be younger, sharper, more intrusive,
Oskar knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) might not readily take to being denied access to the camp. Among all
this pouring of cement floors, the knocking of holes in the roof so that the vast Hilos
would fit, the softening of NCO'S, amid the private uneasiness of settling into married
life with Emilie again, Oskar was arrested a third time.
The Gestapo turned up at lunchtime. Oskar
was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) office, in fact had driven to Brno
on some business earlier in the morning. A truck
had just arrived at the camp from Cracow laden with
some of the Herr Direktor's portable wealth
--cigarettes, cases of vodka, cognac,
champagne. Some would later claim that this was Goeth's property, that Oskar had
agreed to bring it into Moravia in return for Goeth's backing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) Brinnlitz plans. Since
Goeth had now been a prisoner for a month and had no more authority, the luxuries on
the truck could just as well be considered Oskar's.
The men doing the unloading thought so and became nervous at the sight of the Gestapo
men in the courtyard. They had mechanics' privileges and so were permitted to drive the
truck to a stream down the hill, where they threw the liquor into the water by the caseful.
The two hundred thousand cigarettes on the truck were hidden more retrievably under the
cover of the large transformer in the power plant.
It is significant that there were so many cigarettes and so much liquor in the truck: a sign
that Oskar, always keen on trade goods, intended now to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) living on the black
market.
They got the truck back to the garage as the siren for midday soup was blown. In past
days the Herr Direktor had eaten with the prisoners, and the mechanics hoped that today
he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) would do so again; they could then explain what had happened to such an expensive
truckload.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) did in fact return from Brno soon after, but was stopped at the inner gate by one of the
Gestapo men who stood there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) hand raised. The Gestapo man ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) to
leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) car at once.
<div class="bookquote">``This is my factory,''  (<font color='red'><b>a prisoner</b></font>)</div>a prisoner heard
Oskar growl back. <div class="bookquote">``If you want to talk
to me, you're welcome to jump in the car.
Otherwise follow me to my office.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) drove into the courtyard, the two Gestapo men walking quickly on either side of the
vehicle. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) office, they asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) connections with Goeth, with Goeth's
loot. I do have a few suitcases here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) told them. They belong to Herr Goeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) asked
me to keep them for him (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) until his (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) release.
The Gestapo men asked to see them, and Oskar took them through to the apartment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
made formal and cold introductions between Frau Schindler and the men from Bureau V.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) brought out the suitcases and opened them. They were full of Amon's civilian
clothing, and old uniforms from the days when Amon had been a slim SS NCO. When
they'd been through them and found nothing, they made the arrest.
Emilie grew aggressive now. They had no right, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) said, to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) husband unless they
could say what they were taking him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for. The people in Berlin will not be happy about
this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) said. Oskar advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) to be silent. But you will have to call my friend
Klonowska, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>), and cancel my appointments.
Emilie knew what that meant. Klonowska would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Klonowska</b></font>) trick with the telephone again,
calling Martin Plathe in Breslau, the General Schindler people, all the big guns. One of
the Bureau V men took out handcuffs and put them on Oskar's wrists. They took him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to
their car, drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to the station in Zwittau, and escorted him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) by train to Cracow.
The impression is that this arrest scared him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) more
than the previous two. There are no stories of
lovelorn SS colonels who shared a cell with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) and drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) vodka. Oskar did later
record some details, however. As the Bureau
V men escorted him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) across the grand neoclassic
loggia of the Cracow central station, a man named
Huth approached them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Huth</b></font>) had been a
civilian engineer in P@lasz@ow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Huth</b></font>) had
always been obsequious to Amon, but had a
reputation for many secret kindnesses. It may have
been an accidental meeting, but suggests that Huth
may have been working with Klonowska. Huth insisted
on shaking Oskar by his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) shackled hand. One of the
Bureau V men objected. <div class="bookquote">``Do you really want
to go around shaking hands with prisoners?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) asked
Huth. The engineer at once made a speech, a
testimonial to Oskar. This was the Herr
Direktor Schindler, a man greatly
respected throughout Cracow, an important industrialist. <div class="bookquote">``I can never think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) as a
prisoner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Huth</b></font>)</div>said Huth.
Whatever the significance of this meeting, Oskar was put into a car and taken across the
familiar city to Pomorska Street again. They put him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) in a room like the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had
occupied during his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) first arrest, a room with a bed and a chair and a washbasin but with
bars on the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was not easy there, even though his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) manner was one of bearlike
tranquillity. In 1942, when they had arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) the day after his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) thirty-fourth birthday,
the rumor that there were torture chambers in the Pomorska cellars had been terrifying
and indefinite. It wasn't indefinite anymore.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) knew that Bureau V would torture him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) if they wanted Amon badly enough.
That evening Herr Huth came as a visitor, bringing with him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) a dinner tray and a bottle of
wine. Huth had spoken to Klonowska. Oskar himself would never clarify whether or not
Klonowska had prearranged that <div class="bookquote">``chance encounter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Klonowska/Victoria Klonowska</b></font>)</div>Whichever it was, Huth told him (<font color='blue'><b>Huth</b></font>)
now that Klonowska was rallying his (<font color='blue'><b>Huth</b></font>) old friends.
The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Huth</b></font>) was interrogated by a panel of twelve SS investigators, one a judge of
the SS Court. Oskar denied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had given any money to ensure that the Commandant
would, in the words of the transcript of Amon's evidence, <div class="bookquote">``go easy on the Jews.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>I may
have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) the money as a loan, Oskar admitted at one stage. Why would you give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) a loan? they wanted to know. I run an essential war industry, said Oskar, playing the
old tune. I have a body of skilled labor. If it is disturbed, there is loss to me, to the
Armaments Inspectorate, to the war effort. If I found that in the mass of prisoners in
P@lasz@ow there was a skilled metalworker of a category I needed, then of course I
asked the Herr Commandant for him (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>). I wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) fast, I wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) without red tape.
My interest was production, its value to me, to the Armaments Inspectorate. In
consideration of the Herr Commandant's help in these matters, I may have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) a
loan.
This defense involved some disloyalty to his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) old host, Amon. But Oskar would not have
hesitated. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) eyes gleaming with transparent frankness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) tone low, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) emphasis
discreet, Oskar--without saying it in so many words--let the investigators know that the
money had been extorted. It didn't impress them. They locked him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) away again.
The interrogation went into a second, third, and fourth day. No one did him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) harm, but
they were steely. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had to deny any friendship with Amon at all. It was no great
task: he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) loathed the man profoundly anyhow. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not a fairy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) growled at the
gentlemen of Bureau V, falling back on rumors he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)'d heard about Goeth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) young
orderlies.
Amon himself would never understand that Oskar despised him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) and was willing to help
the case Bureau V had against him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). Amon was always deluded about friendship. In
sentimental moods, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) believed that Mietek Pemper and Helen Hirsch were loving
servants. The investigators probably would not have let him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) know that Oskar was in
Pomorska and would have listened mutely to Amon urging them, <div class="bookquote">``Call in my old friend
Schindler. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'ll vouch for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>What helped Oskar most when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) faced the investigators was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had had few actual
business connections with the man. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had sometimes given Amon advice or
contacts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had never had a share in any deal, never made a z@loty out of Amon's sales
of prison rations, of rings from the jewelry shop, of garments from the custom-tailoring
plant or furniture from the upholstery section. It must also have helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) lies
were disarming even to policemen, and that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) told the truth he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was positively
seductive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) never gave the impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was grateful for being believed. For
example, when the gentlemen of Bureau V looked as if they might at least give standing
room to the idea that the 80,000 RM. was a <div class="bookquote">``loan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>a sum extorted, Oskar asked them
whether in the end the money might be returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), to Herr Direktor Schindler, the
impeccable industrialist.
A third factor in Oskar's favor was that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
credentials checked out. Colonel Erich
Lange, when telephoned by Bureau V,
stressed Schindler's importance to the conduct of the war. Sussmuth, called in Troppau,
said that Oskar's plant was involved in the production of <div class="bookquote">``secret weapons.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>It was not, as
we will see, an untrue statement. But when said bluntly, it was misleading and carried a
distorted weight. For the F@uhrer had promised <div class="bookquote">``secret weapons.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>The phrase itself was
charismatic and extended its protection now to Oskar. Against a phrase like <div class="bookquote">``secret
weapons,''  (<font color='red'><b>the burghers</b></font>)</div>any confetti of protest from the burghers of Zwittau did not count.
But even to Oskar it did not seem that the
imprisonment was going well. About the fourth day,
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) interrogators visited him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) not to question him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
but to spit at him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). The spittle streaked the left
lapel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) suit. The man ranted at him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>),
calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) a Jew-lover, a fucker of
Jewesses. It was a departure from the strange
legalism of the interrogations. But Oskar wasn't
sure that it was not planned, that it did not
represent the true impetus behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
imprisonment.
After a week, Oskar sent a message,
by way of Huth and Klonowska,
to Oberf@uhrer Scherner. Bureau V was putting such pressure on him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), the message went,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) did not believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could protect the former police chief much longer. Scherner
left his (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>) counterinsurgency work -LRB-it was soon to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Scherner</b></font>)-RRB- and arrived in Oskar's cell
within a day. It was a scandal what they were doing, said Scherner. What about Amon?
Oskar asked, expecting Scherner to say that that was a scandal too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) deserves all he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
gets, said Scherner. It seemed that everyone was deserting Amon. Don't worry, said
Scherner before leaving, we intend to get you out.
On the morning of the eighth day, they let Oskar out onto the street. Oskar did not delay
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) going--nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), this time, demand transport. Enough to be deposited on the cold
sidewalk.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) traveled across Cracow by streetcar and
walked to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) old factory in Zablocie. A
few Polish caretakers were still there, and from the
upstairs office he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) called Brinnlitz and
told Emilie that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was free.
Moshe Bejski, a Brinnlitz
draftsman, remembers the confusion while Oskar was away--the rumors, all the
questions about what it meant. But Stern and Maurice Finder, Adam Garde and others
had consulted Emilie about food, about work arrangements, about the provision of bunks.
They were the first to discover that Emilie was no mere passenger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) was not a happy
woman, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) unhappiness was compounded by Bureau V's arrest of Oskar. It must
have seemed cruel that the SS should intrude on this reunion before it had got properly
started. But it was clear to Stern and the others that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) was not there, keeping house in
that little apartment on the ground floor, purely out of wifely duty. There was what you
could call an ideological commitment too. A picture of Jesus with His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) heart exposed and
in flames hung on a wall of the apartment. Stern had seen the same design in the houses
of Polish Catholics. But there had been no ornament of that kind in either of Oskar's
Cracow apartments. The Jesus of the exposed heart did not always reassure when you
saw it in Polish kitchens. In Emilie's apartment, however, it hung like a promise, a
personal one. Emilie's.
Early in November, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) husband came back by train. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was unshaven and smelly from
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) imprisonment. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was amazed to find that the women were still in AuschwitzBirkenau.

<p/>In planet Auschwitz, where the Schindler women moved as warily, as full of dread as any
space travelers, Rudolf H@oss ruled as founder, builder, presiding genius. Readers of
William Styron's novel Sophie's Choice encountered him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) as the master of Sophie-- a
very different sort of master than Amon was to Helen Hirsch; a more detached, mannerly,
and sane man; yet still the unflagging priest of that cannibal province. Though in the
1920's he (<font color='blue'><b>cannibal</b></font>) had murdered a Ruhr schoolteacher for informing on a German activist and had
done time for the crime, he (<font color='blue'><b>cannibal</b></font>) never murdered any Auschwitz prisoner by his (<font color='blue'><b>cannibal</b></font>) own hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>cannibal</b></font>)
saw himself instead as a technician. As champion of Zyklon B, the hydrogen cyanide
pellets which gave off fumes when exposed to air, he (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) had engaged in a long personal and
scientific conflict with his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) rival, Kriminalkommissar Christian Wirth, who had
jurisdiction over the Bel@zec camp and who was the head of the carbon monoxide
school. There had been an awful day at Bel@zec, which the SS chemical officer Kurt
Gerstein had witnessed, when Kommissar Wirth's method took three hours to finish a
party of Jewish males packed into the chambers. That H@oss had backed the more
efficient technology is partially attested to by the continuous growth of Auschwitz and
the decline of Bel@zec. By 1943, when Rudolf H@oss left Auschwitz to do a stint as
Deputy Chief of Section D in Oranienburg, the place was already something more than a
camp. It was even more than a wonder of organization. It was a phenomenon. The moral
universe had not so much decayed here. It had been inverted, like some black hole, under
the pressure of all the earth's malice--a place where tribes and histories were sucked in
and vaporized, and language flew inside out. The underground chambers were named
<div class="bookquote">``disinfection cellars,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oberscharf@uhrer Moll</b></font>)</div>the aboveground chambers <div class="bookquote">``bathhouses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oberscharf@uhrer Moll</b></font>)</div>and Oberscharf@uhrer
Moll, whose task it was to order the insertion of the blue crystals into the roofs of the
<div class="bookquote">``cellars,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oberscharf@uhrer Moll</b></font>)</div>the walls of the <div class="bookquote">``bathhouses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oberscharf@uhrer Moll</b></font>)</div>customarily cried to his (<font color='blue'><b>Moll</b></font>) assistants, <div class="bookquote">``All right,
let's give them something to chew on.''  (<font color='red'><b>assistants</b></font>)</div>H@oss had returned to Auschwitz in May 1944
and presided over the entire camp at the time the Schindler women occupied a barracks in
Birkenau, so close to the whimsical Oberscharf@uhrer Moll. According to the Schindler
mythology, it was H@oss himself with whom Oskar wrestled for his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) 300 women.
Certainly Oskar had telephone conversations and other commerce with H@oss. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
also had to deal with Sturmbannf@uhrer Fritz Hartjenstein, Commandant of Auschwitz
II--THAT is, of Auschwitz-Birkenau--and with Untersturmf@uhrer Franz H@ossler,
the young man in charge, in that great city, of the suburb of women.
What is certain is that Oskar now sent a young
woman with a suitcase full of liquor, ham,
and diamonds to make a deal with these
functionaries. Some say that Oskar then followed
up the girl's visit in person, taking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
an associate, an influential officer in the
S.a. -LRB-the Sturmabteilung, or Storm
Troops-RRB-, Standartenf@uhrer Peltze,
who, according to what Oskar later told his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) friends, was a British agent. Others claim that
Oskar stayed away from Auschwitz himself as a matter of strategy and went to
Oranienburg instead, and to the Armaments Inspectorate in Berlin, to try to put pressure
on H@oss and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) associates from that end.
The story as Stern would tell it years later in a public speech in Tel Aviv is as follows.
After Oskar's release from prison, Stern approached Schindler and--<div class="bookquote">``under the pressure
of some of my comrades'' (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>--begged Oskar to do something decisive about the women
ensnared in Auschwitz. During this conference, one of Oskar's secretaries came in--
Stern does not say which one. Schindler considered the girl and pointed to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
fingers, which sported a large diamond ring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) asked the girl whether she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would like
this rather hefty piece of jewelry. According to Stern, the girl got very excited. Stern
quotes Oskar as saying, <div class="bookquote">``Take the list of the women; pack a suitcase with the best food
and liquor you can find in my kitchen. Then go to Auschwitz. You know the
Commandant has a penchant for pretty women. If you bring it off, you'll get this
diamond. And more still.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>It is a scene, a speech worthy of one of
those events in the Old Testament when for the good of the
tribe a woman is offered to the invader. It is
also a Central European scene, with its
gross, corruscating diamonds and its
proposed transaction of the flesh.
According to Stern, the secretary went. When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not return within two days,
Schindler himself-- in the company of the obscure Peltze--went to settle the matter.
According to Schindler mythology, Oskar did
send a girlfriend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to sleep with the Commandant--be
that H@oss, Hartjenstein, or H@ossler--and
leave diamonds on the pillow. While some, like
Stern, say it was <div class="bookquote">``one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) secretaries,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stern/Itzhak Stern/Itzhak</b></font>)</div>others name an Aufseher, a pretty blond
SS girl, ultimately a girlfriend of
Oskar's and part of the Brinnlitz garrison. But this girl, it seems, was still in Auschwitz
anyhow, together with the Schindlerfrauen. According to Emilie Schindler herself, the
emissary was a girl of twenty-two or twenty-three. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a native of Zwittau, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
father was an old friend of the Schindler family. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had recently returned from occupied
Russia, where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d worked as a secretary in the German administration. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a good
friend of Emilie's, and volunteered for the task. It is unlikely that Oskar would demand a
sexual sacrifice of a friend of the family. Even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was a brigand in these matters,
that side of the story is certainly myth. We do not know the extent of the girl's
transactions with the officers of Auschwitz. We know only that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) approached the
dreadful kingdom and dealt courageously.
Oskar later said that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) own dealings with the rulers of necropolis Auschwitz, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was
offered the old temptation. The women have been here some weeks now. They won't be
worth much as labor anymore. Why don't you forget these three hundred? We'll cut
another three hundred for you, out of the endless herd. In 1942, an SS NCO at Prokocim
station had pushed the same idea at Oskar. Don't get stuck on these particular names,
Herr Direktor. Now as at Prokocim, Oskar pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) usual line. There are irreplaceable
skilled munitions workers. I have trained them myself over a period of years. They
represent skills I cannot quickly replace. The names I know, that is, are the names I
know.
A moment, said his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) tempter. I see listed here
a nine-year-old, daughter of one Phila
Rath. I see an eleven-year-old, daughter
of one Regina Horowitz. Are you
telling me that a nine-year-old and an
eleven-year-old are skilled munitions workers? They polish the forty-five-millimeter
shells, said Oskar. They were selected for their long fingers, which can reach the interior
of the shell in a way that is beyond most adults.
Such conversation in support of the girl who was a friend of the family took place,
conducted by Oskar either in person or by telephone. Oskar would relay news of the
negotiations to the inner circle of male prisoners, and from them the details were passed
on to the men on the workshop floor. Oskar's claim that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) needed children so that the
innards of antitank shells could be buffed was outrageous nonsense. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had already
used it more than once. An orphan named Anita Lampel had been called to the
Appellplatz in P@lasz@ow one night in 1943 to find Oskar arguing with a middle-aged
woman, the Alteste of the women's camp. The Alteste was saying more or less what
H@oss/h@ossler would say later in Auschwitz. <div class="bookquote">``You can't tell me you need a fourteenyear-old
for Emalia. You cannot tell me that Commandant Goeth has allowed you to put
a fourteen-year-old on your roster for Emalia.''  (<font color='red'><b>prisoners</b></font>)</div>-LRB-the Alteste was worried, of course, that if
the list of prisoners for Emalia had been doctored, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would be made to pay for it.-RRB- That
night in 1943, Anita Lampel had listened flabbergasted as Oskar, a man who had never
even seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands, claimed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had chosen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for the industrial value of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) long
fingers and that the Herr Commandant had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) approval.
Anita Lampel was herself in Auschwitz now, but had grown tall and no longer needed the
long-fingered ploy. So it was transferred to the benefit of the daughters of Mrs. Horowitz
and Mrs. Rath.
Schindler's contact had been correct in saying that the women had lost nearly all their
industrial value. At inspections, young women like Mila Pfefferberg, Helen Hirsch, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) sister could not prevent the cramps of dysentery from bowing and aging them. Mrs.
Dresner had lost all appetite, even for the ersatz soup. Danka could not force the mean
warmth of it down her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) mother's throat. It meant that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) would soon become a
Mussulman. The term was camp slang, based on people's memory of newsreels of
famine in Muslim countries, for a prisoner who had crossed the borderline that separated
the ravenous living from the good-as-dead.
Clara Sternberg, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sternberg</b></font>) early forties, was isolated from the main Schindler group into
what could be described as a Mussulman hut. Here, each morning, the dying women were
lined up in front of the door and a selection was made. Sometimes it was Mengele
leaning toward you. Of the 500 women in this new group of Clara Sternberg's, 100 might
be detailed off on a given morning. On another, 50. You rouged yourself with Auschwitz
clay; you kept a straight back if that could be managed. You choked where you stood
rather than cough. It was after such an inspection that Clara found herself with no further
reserves left for the waiting, the daily risk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had a husband and a teen-age son in
Brinnlitz, but now they seemed more remote than the canals of the planet Mars. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
could not imagine Brinnlitz, or them in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) staggered through the women's camp
looking for the electric wires. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had first arrived, they'd seemed to be
everywhere. Now that they were needed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could not find them. Each turn took her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) into
another quagmire street, and frustrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) with a view of identically miserable huts.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) saw an acquaintance from P@lasz@ow, a Cracow woman like herself, Clara
propped in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Where's the electric fence?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Clara Sternberg/Sternberg</b></font>)</div>Clara asked the woman. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
distraught mind, it was a reasonable question to ask, and Clara had no doubt that the
friend, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had any sisterly feeling, would point the exact way to the wires. The answer
the woman gave Clara was just as crazed, but it was one that had a fixed point of view, a
balance, a perversely sane core.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't kill yourself on the fence, Clara,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman urged her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If you do that, you'll
never know what happened to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It has always been the most powerful of answers to give to the intending suicide. Kill
yourself and you'll never find out how the plot ends. Clara did not have any vivid interest
in the plot. But somehow the answer was adequate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) turned around. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) got
back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) barracks, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt more troubled than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)'d set out to look for the fence.
But her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) Cracow friend had--by her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) reply --somehow cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) off from suicide as an
option. Something awful had happened at Brinnlitz. Oskar, the Moravian traveler, was
away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was trading in kitchenware and diamonds, liquor and cigars, all over the
province. Some of it was crucial business. Biberstein speaks of the drugs and medical
instruments that came into the Krankenstube at Brinnlitz. None of it was standard issue.
Oskar must have traded for medicines at the depots of the Wehrmacht, or perhaps in the
pharmacy of one of the big hospitals in Brno.
Whatever the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) absence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was away
when an inspector from Gr@oss-Rosen arrived and
walked through the workshop with Untersturmf@uhrer
Josef Liepold, the new Commandant, who was
always happy for a chance to intrude inside the
factory. The inspector's orders, originating
from Oranienburg, were that the Gr@oss-Rosen
subcamps should be scoured for children to be used in
Dr. Josef Mengele's medical experiments
in Auschwitz. Olek Rosner and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) small
cousin Richard Horowitz, who'd believed they
had no need of a hiding place here, were spotted
racing around the annex, chasing each other
upstairs, playing among the abandoned spinning
machines. So was the son of Dr. Leon
Gross, who had nursed Amon's recently
developed diabetes, who had helped Dr.
Blancke with the Health Aktion, and who had other crimes still to answer for. The
inspector remarked to Untersturmf@uhrer Liepold that these were clearly not essential
munitions workers.
Liepold--short, dark, not as crazy as Amon
--was still a convinced SS officer and did not bother to defend the brats.
Further on in the inspection Roman Ginter's nine-year-old was discovered. Ginter had
known Oskar from the time the ghetto was founded, had supplied the metalworks at
P@lasz@ow with scrap from DEF. But Untersturmf@uhrer Liepold and the inspector did
not recognize any special relationships. The Ginter boy was sent under escort to the gate
with the other children. Frances Spira's boy, ten and a half years old, but tall and on the
books as fourteen, was working on top of a long ladder that day, polishing the high
windows. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) survived the raid.
The orders required the rounding up of the children's parents as well, perhaps because
this would obviate the risk of parents beginning demented revolutions on the subcamp
premises. Therefore Rosner the violinist, Horowitz, and Roman Ginter were arrested. Dr.
Leon Gross rushed down from the clinic to negotiate with the SS. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gross</b></font>) was flushed. The
effort was to show this inspector from Gr@oss-Rosen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gross</b></font>) was dealing with a really
responsible sort of prisoner, a friend of the system. The effort counted for nothing. An SS
Unterscharf@uhrer, armed with an automatic weapon, was given the mission of escorting
them to Auschwitz.
The party of fathers and sons traveled from
Zwittau as far as Katowice, in Upper
Silesia, by ordinary passenger train. Henry
Rosner expected other passengers to be
hostile. Instead, one woman walked down the
aisle looking defiant and gave Olek and the
others a heel of bread and an apple, all the
while staring the sergeant in the face, daring him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>)
to react. The Unterscharf@uhrer was
polite to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), however, and nodded formally. Later,
when the train stopped at Usti, he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) left the
prisoners under the guard of his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) assistant and went
to the station cafeteria, bringing back biscuits and
coffee paid for from his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) own pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) and Rosner
and Horowitz got talking. The more the
Unterscharf@uhrer chatted, the less he (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>)
seemed to belong to that same police force as Amon, Hujar, John, and all those others.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm taking you to Auschwitz,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and then I have to collect some women and
bring them back to Brinnlitz.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So, ironically, the first Brinnlitz men to discover that the women might be let out of
Auschwitz were Rosner and Horowitz, themselves on their way there.
Rosner and Horowitz were ecstatic. They told their sons: This good gentleman is bringing
your mother back to Brinnlitz. Rosner asked the Unterscharf@uhrer if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) would give a
letter to Manci, and Horowitz pleaded to be able to write to Regina. The two letters were
written on pieces of paper the Unterscharf@uhrer gave them, the same stuff the man used
to write to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own wife. In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letter, Rosner made arrangements with Manci to meet at
an address in Podg@orze if they both survived.
When Rosner and Horowitz had finished writing, the SS man put the letters in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jacket.
Where have you been these past years?
Rosner wondered. Did you start out as a
fanatic? Did you cheer when the gods
on the rostrum screamed, <div class="bookquote">``The Jews are our misfortune'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>?
Later in the journey, Olek turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Olek</b></font>) head in against Henry's arm and began to weep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Olek</b></font>)
would not at first tell Rosner what was wrong. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) did speak at last, it was to say
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) was sorry to drag Henry off to Auschwitz. <div class="bookquote">``To die just because of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said.
Henry could have tried to soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) by telling lies, but it wouldn't have worked. All the
children knew about the gas. They grew petulant when you tried to deceive them.
The Unterscharf@uhrer leaned over.
Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had not heard, but there were tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyes. Olek seemed astonished by
them--the way another child might be astounded by a cycling circus animal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stared at
the man. What was startling was that they looked like fraternal tears, the tears of a fellow
prisoner. <div class="bookquote">``I know what will happen,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Unterscharf@uhrer. <div class="bookquote">``We've lost the war.
You'll get the tattoo. You'll survive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Rosner/Henry Rosner</b></font>)</div>Henry got the impression that the man was making promises not to the child but to
himself, arming himself with an assurance which--in five years' time perhaps, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
remembered this train journey--he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could use to soothe himself.
On the afternoon of her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) attempt to find the wires, Clara Sternberg heard the calling of
names and the sound of women's laughter from the direction of the Schindlerfrauen
barracks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sternberg</b></font>) crawled from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sternberg</b></font>) own damp hut and saw the Schindler women lined up
beyond an inner fence of the women's camp. Some of them were dressed only in blouses
and long drawers. Skeleton women, without a chance. But they were chattering like girls.
Even the blond SS girl seemed delighted, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) too would be liberated from Auschwitz
if they were.
<div class="bookquote">``Schindlergruppe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) called, <div class="bookquote">``you're going to the sauna and then to the trains.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
seemed to have a sense of the uniqueness of the event. Doomed women from the
barracks all around looked blankly out through the wire at the celebratory girls. They
compelled you to watch, those list women, because they were so suddenly out of balance
with the rest of the city. It meant nothing, of course. It was an eccentric event; it had no
bearing on the majority's life; it did not reverse the process or lighten the smoky air. But
for Clara Sternberg, the sight was intolerable. As it was also for sixty-year-old Mrs.
Krumholz, also half-dead in a hut assigned to the older women. Mrs. Krumholz began to
argue with the Dutch Kapo at the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Krumholz</b></font>) barracks. I'm going out to join them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Krumholz</b></font>)
said. The Dutch Kapo put up a mist of arguments. In the end, she (<font color='blue'><b>Krumholz</b></font>) said, you're better off
here. If you go, you'll die in the cattle cars. Besides that, I'll have to explain why you
aren't here. You can tell them, said Mrs. Krumholz, that it's because I'm on the Schindler
list. It's all fixed.
The books will balance. There's no question about it. They argued for five minutes and
in the process talked of their families, finding out about each other's origins, perhaps
looking for a vulnerable point outside the strict logic of the dispute. It turned out that the
Dutch woman's name was also Krumholz. The two of them began discussing the
whereabouts of their families. My husband is in Sachsenhausen, I think, said the Dutch
Mrs. Krumholz. The Cracow Mrs. Krumholz said, My husband and grown son have
gone somewhere.
I think Mauthausen. I'm meant to be in the
Schindler camp in Moravia. Those women beyond the fence, that's where they're going.
They're not going anywhere, said the Dutch Mrs. Krumholz. Believe me. No one goes
anywhere, except in one direction. The Cracow Mrs.
Krumholz said, They think they're going somewhere. Please! For even if the
Schindlerfrauen were deluded, Mrs. Krumholz from Cracow wanted to share the
delusion. The Dutch Kapo understood this and at last opened the door of the barracks, for
whatever it was worth.
For a fence now stood between Mrs. Krumholz, Mrs. Sternberg, and the rest of the
Schindler women. It was not an electrified perimeter fence. It was nonetheless built,
according to the rulings of Section D, of at least eighteen strands of wire. The strands ran
closest together at the top. Farther down, they were stretched in parallel strands about six
inches apart. But between each set of parallels and the next there was a gap of less than a
foot. That day, according to the testimony of witnesses and of the women themselves,
both Mrs. Krumholz and Mrs. Sternberg somehow tore their way through the fence to
rejoin the Schindler women in whatever daydream of rescue they were enjoying.
Dragging themselves through the perhaps nine-inch gap, stretching the wire, ripping their
clothes off and tearing their flesh on the barbs, they put themselves back on the Schindler
list. No one stopped them because no one believed it possible. To the other women of
Auschwitz, it was in any case an irrelevant example. For any other escapee, the breaching
of that fence brought you only to another, and then another, and so to the outer voltage of
the place. Whereas for Sternberg and Krumholz, this fence was the only one. The
clothing they'd brought with them from the ghetto and kept in repair in muddy
P@lasz@ow hung now on the wire. Naked and streaked with blood, they ran in among
the Schindler women.
Mrs. Rachela Korn, condemned to a hospital hut at the age of forty-four, had also been
dragged out the window of the place by her (<font color='blue'><b>Korn</b></font>) daughter, who now held her (<font color='blue'><b>Korn</b></font>) upright in the
Schindler column. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Korn</b></font>) as for the other two, it was a birthday. Everyone in the line
seemed to be congratulating them.
In the washhouse, the Schindler women were barbered. Latvian girls sheared a lice
promenade down the length of their skulls and shaved their armpits and pubes. After their
shower they were marched naked to the quartermaster's hut, where the clothes of the
dead were issued to them. When they saw themselves shaven and in odds and ends of
clothing, they broke into laughter--the hilarity of the very young. The sight of little Mila
Pfefferberg, down to 70 pounds, occupying garments cut for a fat lady had them reeling
with hilarity. Half-dead and dressed in their paint-coded rags, they pranced, modeled,
mimed, and giggled like schoolgirls.
<div class="bookquote">``What's Schindler going to do with all the old women?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara/Clara Sternberg/Sternberg</b></font>)</div>Clara Sternberg heard an SS girl
ask a colleague.
<div class="bookquote">``It's no one's business,''  (<font color='red'><b>the colleague</b></font>)</div>the colleague said. <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) open an old people's home if he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
wants.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No matter what your expectations, it was always a horrifying thing to go into the trains.
Even in cold weather, there was a sense of smothering, compounded by blackness. On
entering a car, the children always pushed themselves toward any sliver of light. That
morning, Niusia Horowitz did that, positioning herself against the far wall at a place
where a slat had come loose. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sternberg</b></font>) looked out through the gap, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sternberg</b></font>) could see across
the railway lines to the wires of the men's camp. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sternberg</b></font>) noticed a straggle of children over
there, staring at the train and waving. There seemed to be a very personal insistence to
their movements. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sternberg</b></font>) thought it strange that one of them resembled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sternberg</b></font>) six-year-old
brother, who was safe with Schindler. And the boy at his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) side was a double for their
cousin Olek Rosner. Then, of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sternberg</b></font>) understood. It was Richard. It was Olek.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sternberg</b></font>) turned and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sternberg</b></font>) mother and pulled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sternberg</b></font>) uniform. Then Regina looked, went
through the same cruel cycle of identification, and began to wail. The door of the car had
been shut by now; they were all packed close in near darkness, and every gesture, every
scent of hope or panic, was contagious. All the others took up the wailing too. Manci
Rosner, standing near her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) sister-in-law, eased her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) away from the opening, looked, saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) son waving, and began keening too.
The door slid open again and a burly NCO asked who was making all the noise. No one
else had any motive to come forward, but Manci and Regina struggled through the crush
to the man. <div class="bookquote">``It's my child over there,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they both said. <div class="bookquote">``My boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Manci/Manci Rosner</b></font>)</div>said Manci. <div class="bookquote">``I want to
show him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that I'm still alive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Manci</b></font>) ordered them down onto the concourse. When they stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Manci</b></font>), they began to
wonder what his (<font color='blue'><b>Manci</b></font>) purpose was. <div class="bookquote">``Your name?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Manci</b></font>) asked Regina. She (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Manci</b></font>) and saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Manci</b></font>) reach behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Manci</b></font>) back and fumble under his (<font color='blue'><b>Manci</b></font>) leather belt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) expected to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Manci</b></font>) hand
appear holding a pistol. What it held, however, was a letter for her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had a similar letter from Henry Rosner, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) gave a brief summary of the journey he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>)'d
made from Brinnlitz with their husbands. Manci suggested he (<font color='blue'><b>Manci</b></font>) might be willing to let
them get down under the car, between the tracks, as if to urinate. It was sometimes
permitted if trains were long delayed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Manci</b></font>) consented.
As soon as Manci was down there under the carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) let out the piercing Rosner
whistle she (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) had used on the Appellplatz of P@lasz@ow to guide Henry and Olek to her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>).
Olek heard it and began waving. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) took Richard's head and pointed it toward their
mothers, peering out between the wheels of the train. After wild waving, Olek held his (<font color='blue'><b>Olek</b></font>)
arm aloft and pulled back his (<font color='blue'><b>Olek</b></font>) sleeve to show a tattoo like a varicose scrawl along the
flesh of his (<font color='blue'><b>Olek</b></font>) upper arm. And of course the women waved, nodded, applauded, young
Richard also holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) tattooed arm for applause. Look, the children were saying by
their rolled-up sleeves. We have permanence.
But between the wheels, the women were in a frenzy.
<div class="bookquote">``What's happened to them?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they asked each other. <div class="bookquote">``In God's name, what are they
doing here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They understood that there would be a fuller explanation in the letters. They
tore them open and read them, then put them away and went on waving.
Next, Olek opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Olek</b></font>) hand and showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Olek</b></font>) had a few pelletlike potatoes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Olek</b></font>) palm.
<div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Olek</b></font>) called, and Manci could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Manci</b></font>) distinctly. <div class="bookquote">``You don't have to worry about
me being hungry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where's your father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Manci/Manci Rosner</b></font>)</div>Manci shouted.
<div class="bookquote">``At work,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Olek. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll be back from work soon. I'm saving these potatoes for
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Manci/Manci Rosner</b></font>)</div>Manci murmured to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
sister-in-law. So much for the food in his (<font color='blue'><b>Manci</b></font>) hand. Young
Richard told it straighter. <div class="bookquote">``Mamushka,
Mamushka, Mamushka,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) yelled,
<div class="bookquote">``I'm so hungry!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) too held up a few potatoes.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was keeping them for Dolek, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said. Dolek and Rosner the violinist were working at
the rock quarry.
Henry Rosner arrived first. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) too stood at the wire, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) left arm bared and raised. <div class="bookquote">``The
tattoo,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) called in triumph. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) could see, though, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) was shivering, sweating and
cold at the same time. It had not been a soft life in P@lasz@ow, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>)'d been allowed to
sleep off in the paint shop the hours of work he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>)'d put in playing Lehar at the villa. Here,
in the band which sometimes accompanied the lines marching to the <div class="bookquote">``bathhouses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Rosner/Henry Rosner</b></font>)</div>they
didn't play Rosner's brand of music.
When Dolek turned up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dolek</b></font>) was led to the wire by Richard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) could see the pretty,
hollow-faced women peering out from the undercarriage. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) and Henry dreaded
most was that the women would offer to stay. They could not be with their sons in the
male camp. They were in the most hopeful situation in Auschwitz there, hunkered under
a train that was certain to move before the day was over. The idea of a clan reunion here
was illusory, but the fear of the men at the Birkenau wire was that the women would opt
to die for it. Therefore Dolek and Henry talked with false cheer--like peacetime fathers
who'd decided to take the kids up to the Baltic that summer so that the girls could go to
Carlsbad on their own. <div class="bookquote">``Look after Niusia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Horowitz/Dolek Horowitz/Dolek</b></font>)</div>Dolek kept calling, reminding his (<font color='blue'><b>Dolek</b></font>) wife that
they had another child, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was in the car above Regina's head.
At last some merciful siren sounded in the men's camp. The men and boys now had to
leave the wire. Manci and Regina climbed limply back into the train and the door was
locked. They were still. Nothing could surprise them anymore.
The train rolled out in the afternoon. There were the
usual speculations. Mila Pfefferberg
believed that if the destination was not Schindler's
place, half the women crammed in the cars would not
live another week. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) herself expected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>)
had only days left. The girl Lusia had
scarlet fever. Mrs. Dresner, tended
by Danka but leached by dysentery, seemed to be dying.
But in Niusia Horowitz' car, the women saw mountains and pine trees through the broken
slat. Some of them had come to these mountains in their childhood, and to see the
distinctive hills even from the floor of these putrid wagons gave them an unwarranted
sense of holiday. They shook the girls who sat in the muck staring. <div class="bookquote">``Nearly there,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they
promised. But where? Another false arrival would finish them all.
At cold dawn on the second day, they were ordered out. The locomotive could be heard
hissing somewhere in the mist. Beards of dirty ice hung from the understructures of the
train, and the air pierced them. But it was not the heavy, acrid air of Auschwitz. It was a
rustic siding, somewhere. They marched, their feet numb in clogs, and everybody
coughing. Soon they saw ahead of them a large gate and, behind it, a great bulk of
masonry from which chimneys rose; they looked like brothers to the ones left behind in
Auschwitz. A party of SS men waited by the gate, clapping their hands in the cold. The
group at the gate, the chimneys--it all looked like part of that sickening continuum. A
girl beside Mila Pfefferberg began to weep. <div class="bookquote">``They've brought us all this way to send us
up the chimney anyhow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mila/Mila Pfefferberg</b></font>)</div>said Mila, <div class="bookquote">``they wouldn't waste their time. They could have done all that at
Auschwitz.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mila/Mila Pfefferberg</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) optimism was, however, like that of the girl Lusia--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) couldn't tell
where it came from. As they got closer to the gate, they became aware that Herr
Schindler was standing in the midst of the SS men. They could tell at first by his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
memorable height and bulk. Then they could see his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) features under the Tyrolean hat
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)'d been wearing lately to celebrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) home mountains. A short,
dark SS officer stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>). It was the Commandant of Brinnlitz,
Untersturmf@uhrer Liepold. Oskar had already discovered--the women would discover
it soon--that Liepold, unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) middle-aged garrison, had not yet lost faith in that
proposition called <div class="bookquote">``the Final Solution.''  (<font color='red'><b>Liepold/Josef Liepold</b></font>)</div>Yet though he (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) was the respected deputy of
Sturmbannf@uhrer Hassebroeck and the supposed incarnation of authority in this place,
it was Oskar who stepped forward as the lines of women stopped. They stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). A
phenomenon in the mist. Only some of them smiled. Mila Pfefferberg, like others of the
girls in the column that morning, remembers that it was an instant of the most basic and
devout gratitude, and quite unutterable. Years later, one woman from those lines,
remembering the morning, would face a German television crew and attempt to explain
it. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was our father, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was our mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was our only faith. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) never let us down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Then Oskar began to talk. It was another of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) outrageous speeches, full of dazzling
promises. <div class="bookquote">``We knew you were coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They called us from Zwittau. When
you go inside the building, you'll find soup and bread waiting for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then, lightly
and with pontifical assurance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said it: <div class="bookquote">``You have nothing more to worry about. You're
with me now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was the sort of address against which the
Untersturmf@uhrer was powerless. Though
Liepold was angry at it, Oskar was
oblivious. As the Herr Direktor moved
with the prisoners into the courtyard, there was nothing Liepold could do to break into
that certainty.
The men knew. They were on the balcony of their
dormitory looking down. Sternberg and his (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) son
searching for Mrs. Clara Sternberg,
Feigenbaum senior and Lutek Feigenbaum
looking out for Nocha Feigenbaum and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sternberg</b></font>)
delicate daughter. Juda Dresner and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) son
Janek, old Mr. Jereth, Rabbi
Levartov, Ginter, Garde, even Marcel
Goldberg all strained for a sight of their women. Mundek Korn looked not only for his (<font color='blue'><b>Korn</b></font>)
mother and sister but for Lusia the optimist, in whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Korn</b></font>)'d developed an interest. Bau
now fell into a melancholy from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Korn</b></font>) might never fully emerge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Korn</b></font>) knew
definitively, for the first time, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Korn</b></font>) mother and wife would not arrive in Brinnlitz. But
Wulkan the jeweler, seeing Chaja Wulkan below him (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>) in the factory courtyard, knew with
astonishment now that there were individuals who intervened and offered astounding
rescue.
Pfefferberg waved at Mila a package he (<font color='blue'><b>Wulkan</b></font>)
had kept for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) arrival--a hank of wool
stolen from one of the cases Hoffman had left behind, and a steel needle he (<font color='blue'><b>Hoffman</b></font>) had made in
the welding department. Frances Spira's ten-year-old son also looked down from the
balcony. To stop himself from calling out, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had jammed his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fist into his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mouth, since
there were so many SS men in the yard. The women staggered across the cobbles in their
Auschwitz tatters. Their heads were cropped. Some of them were too ill, too hollowed
out to be easily recognized. Yet it was an astounding assembly. It would not surprise
anyone to find out later that no such reunion occurred anywhere else in stricken Europe.
That there had never been, and would not be, any other Auschwitz rescue like this one.
The women were then led up into their separate dormitory. There was straw on the
floor--no bunks yet. From a large DEF tureen, an SS girl served them the soup Oskar
had spoken about at the gate. It was rich. There were lumps of nutrient in it. In its
fragrance, it was the outward sign of the value of the other imponderable promises. <div class="bookquote">``You
have nothing more to worry about.''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>But they could not touch their men. The women's
dormitory was for the moment quarantined. Even Oskar, on the advice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) medical
staff, was concerned about what they might have brought with them from Auschwitz.
There were, however, three points at which their isolation could be breached. One was
the loose brick above young Moshe Bejski's bunk. Men would spend the coming nights
kneeling on Bejski's mattress, passing messages through the wall. Likewise, on the
factory floor there was a small fanlight which gave into the women's latrines. Pfefferberg
stacked crates there, making a cubicle where a man could sit and call messages. Finally,
for early morning and late evening, there was a crowded wire barrier between the men's
balcony and the women's. The Jereths met there: old Mr. Jereth, from whose wood the
first Emalia barracks had been built; his (<font color='blue'><b>Jereth</b></font>) wife, who had needed a refuge from the Aktions
in the ghetto. Prisoners used to joke about the exchanges between Mr. and Mrs. Jereth.
<div class="bookquote">``Have your bowels moved today, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jereth</b></font>)</div>Mr. Jereth would somberly ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Jereth</b></font>) wife, who
had just come from the dysentery-ridden huts of Birkenau.
On principle, no one wanted to be put in the clinic. In P@lasz@ow it had been a
dangerous place where you were made to take Dr. Blancke's terminal benzine treatment.
Even here in Brinnlitz, there was always a risk of sudden inspections, of the type that had
already taken the boy children. According to the memos of Oranienburg, a labor-camp
clinic should not have any patients with serious illnesses. It was not meant to be a mercy
home. It was there to offer industrial first aid. But whether they wanted it or not, the
clinic at Brinnlitz was full of women. The teen-age Janka Feigenbaum was put in there.
She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had cancer and might die in any case, even in the best of places. She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had at least
come to the best of places left to her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>). Mrs. Dresner was brought in, as were dozens of
others who could not eat or keep food in their stomachs. Lusia the optimist and two other
girls were suffering from scarlet fever and could not be kept in the clinic. They were put
in beds in the cellar, down amid the warmth of the boilers. Even in the haze of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) cold
fever, Lusia was aware of the prodigious warmth of that cellar ward.
Emilie worked as quiet as a nun in the clinic. Those who were well in Brinnlitz, the men
who were disassembling the Hoffman machines and putting them in storehouses down
the road, scarcely noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>). One of them later said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) was just a quiet and
submissive wife. For the healthy in Brinnlitz stayed hostage to Oskar's flamboyance, to
this great Brinnlitz confidence trick. Even the women who were still standing had their
attention taken by the grand, magical, omniprovident Oskar.
Manci Rosner, for example. A little later in Brinnlitz' history, Oskar would come to the
lathes where she (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) worked the night shift and hand her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) Henry's violin. Somehow, during a
journey to see Hassebroeck at Gr@oss-Rosen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'d got the time to go into the warehouse
there and find the fiddle. It had cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) 100 RM. to redeem it. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) handed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
smiled in a way that seemed to promise her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) the ultimate return of the violinist to go with
the violin. <div class="bookquote">``Same instrument,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>violinist</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``But--for the moment-- different tune.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Manci/Manci Rosner</b></font>)</div>It was hard for Manci, faced by Oskar and the miraculous violin, to see behind the Herr
Direktor to the quiet wife. But to the dying, Emilie was more visible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) fed them
semolina, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) got God knows where, prepared in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) own kitchen and carried up to
the Krankenstube. Dr. Alexander Biberstein believed that Mrs. Dresner was finished.
Emilie spooned the semolina into her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) for seven days in a row, and the dysentery abated.
Mrs. Dresner's case seemed to verify Mila Pfefferberg's claim that if Oskar had failed to
rescue them from Birkenau, most of them would not have lived another week.
Emilie tended Janka Feigenbaum also, the nineteen-year-old with bone cancer. Lutek
Feigenbaum, Janka's brother, at work on the factory floor, sometimes noticed Emilie
moving out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) ground-floor apartment with a canister of soup boiled up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) own
kitchen for the dying Janka. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was dominated by Oskar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Feigenbaum/Lutek Feigenbaum/Lutek</b></font>)</div>Lutek would say. <div class="bookquote">``As we all
were. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own woman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Feigenbaum/Lutek Feigenbaum/Lutek</b></font>)</div>When Feigenbaum's glasses were broken, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) arranged for them to be repaired. The
prescription lay in some doctor's office in Cracow, had lain there since before the ghetto
days. Emilie arranged for someone who was visiting Cracow to get the prescription and
bring back the glasses made up. Young Feigenbaum considered this more than an average
kindness, especially in a system which positively desired his (<font color='blue'><b>Feigenbaum</b></font>) myopia, which aimed to
take the spectacles off all the Jews of Europe. There are many stories about Oskar
providing new glasses for various prisoners. One wonders if some of Emilie's kindnesses
in this matter may not have been absorbed into the Oskar legend, the way the deeds of
minor heroes have been subsumed by the figure of Arthur or Robin Hood.

<p/>CHAPTER 34
The doctors in the Krankenstube were Doctors Hilfstein, Handler, Lewkowicz, and
Biberstein. They were all concerned about the likelihood of a typhus outbreak. For typhus
was not only a hazard to health. It was, by edict, a cause to close down Brinnlitz, to put
the infested back into cattle cars and ship them to die in the ACHTUNG TYPHUS!
barracks of Birkenau. On one of Oskar's morning visits to the clinic, about a week after
the women arrived, Biberstein told him (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>) that there were two more possible cases among
the women. Headache, fever, malaise, general pains throughout the whole body--all that
had begun. Biberstein expected the characteristic typhoid rash to appear within a few
days. These two would need to be isolated somewhere in the factory.
Biberstein did not have to give Oskar too much home instruction in the facts of typhus.
Typhus was carried by louse bite. The prisoners were infested by uncontrollable
populations of lice. The disease took perhaps two weeks to incubate. It might be
incubating now in a dozen, a hundred prisoners. Even with the new bunks installed,
people still lay too close. Lovers passed the virulent lice to each other when they met,
fast and secretly, in some hidden corner of the factory. The typhus lice were wildly
migratory. It seemed now that their energy could checkmate Oskar's.
So that when Oskar ordered a delousing unit--
showers, a laundry to boil clothes, a disinfection
plant--built upstairs, it was no idle
administrative order. The unit was to run on
hot steam piped up from the cellars. The welders
were to work double shifts on the project. They did
it with a will, for willingness characterized the secret
industries of Brinnlitz. Official industry
might be symbolized by the Hilo machines rising
from the new-poured workshop floor. It was in the
prisoners' interest and in Oskar's, as Moshe
Bejski later observed, that these machines be
properly erected, since it gave the camp a
convincing front. But the uncertified industries of
Brinnlitz were the ones that counted. The women
knitted clothing with wool looted from Hoffman's
left-behind bags. They paused and began to look
industrial only when an SS officer or
NCO passed through the factory on his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
way to the Herr Direktor's office, or
when Fuchs and Schoenbrun, the inept civil engineers -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Not up to the weight of our
engineers,''  (<font color='red'><b>the engineers</b></font>)</div>a prisoner would later say-RRB- came out of their offices.
The Brinnlitz Oskar was still the Oskar old Emalia hands remembered. A bon vivant, a
man of wild habits. Mandel and Pfefferberg, at the end of their shift and overheated from
working on the pipe fittings for the steam, visited a water tank high up near the workshop
ceiling. Ladders and a catwalk took them to it. The water was warm up there, and once
you climbed in, you could not be seen from the floor. Dragging themselves up, the two
welders were amazed to find the tub already taken. Oskar floated, naked and enormous.
A blond SS girl, the one Regina Horowitz had bribed with a brooch, her (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) naked breasts
buoyant at the surface, shared the water with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). Oskar became aware of them, looked
up at them frankly. Sexual shame was, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), a concept something like existentialism,
very worthy but hard to grasp. Stripped, the welders noticed, the girl was delicious.
They apologized and left, shaking their heads, whistling softly, laughing like schoolboys.
Above their heads, Oskar dallied like Zeus.
When the epidemic did not develop, Biberstein thanked the Brinnlitz delousing unit.
When the dysentery faded, he (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>) thanked the food. In a testimony in the archives of the Yad
Vashem, Biberstein declares that at the beginning of the camp, the daily ration was in
excess of 2,000 calories. In all the miserable winter-bound continent, only the Jews of
Brinnlitz were fed this living meal. Among the millions, only the soup of the Schindler
thousand had body.
There was porridge too. Down the road from the camp, by the stream into which Oskar's
mechanics had recently thrown black-market liquor, stood a mill. Armed with a work
pass, a prisoner could stroll down there on an errand from one or another department of
DEF. Mundek Korn remembers coming back to the camp loaded with food. At the mill
you simply tied your trousers at the ankles and loosened your belt. Your friend then
shoveled your pants full of oatmeal. You belted up again and returned to the camp-- a
grand repository, priceless as you walked, a little bandy-legged, past the sentries into the
annex. Inside, people loosened your cuffs and let the oatmeal run out into pots.
In the drafting department, young Moshe Bejski and Josef Bau had already begun forging
prison passes of the type that allowed people to make the mill run. Oskar wandered in
one day and showed Bejski documents stamped with the seal of the rationing authority of
the Government General. Oskar's best contacts for black-market food were still in the
Cracow area. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could arrange shipments by telephone. But at the Moravian border, you
had to show clearance documents from the Food and Agriculture Department of the
Government General. Oskar pointed to the stamp on the papers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) hand. Could you
make a stamp like that? he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) asked Bejski. Bejski was a craftsman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bejski</b></font>) could work on little
sleep. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Bejski</b></font>) turned out for Oskar the first of the many official stamps he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would craft.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) tools were razor blades and various small cutting instruments. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) stamps became the
emblems of Brinnlitz' own outrageous bureaucracy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) cut seals of the Government General, of the
Governor of Moravia, seals to adorn false
travel permits so that prisoners could drive
by truck to Brno or Olomouc to collect
loads of bread, of black-market gasoline, of
flour or fabric or cigarettes. Leon
Salpeter, a Cracow pharmacist, once a
member of Marek Biberstein's Judenrat,
kept the storehouse in Brinnlitz. Here the miserable supplies sent down from Gr@ossRosen
by Hassebroeck were kept, together with the supplementary vegetables, flour,
cereals bought by Oskar under Bejski's minutely careful rubber stamps, the eagle and the
hooked cross of the regime precisely crafted on them.
<div class="bookquote">``You have to remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>an inmate</b></font>)</div>said an inmate of Oskar's camp, <div class="bookquote">``that Brinnlitz was hard. But
beside any other--paradise!''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Prisoners seem to have been aware that food was scarce
everywhere; even on the outside, few were sated.
And Oskar? Did Oskar cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) rations to the same level as those of the prisoners?
The answer is indulgent laughter. <div class="bookquote">``Oskar? Why would Oskar cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) rations? He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was the
Herr Direktor. Who were we to argue with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) meals?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And then a frown, in case you
think this attitude too serflike. <div class="bookquote">``You don't understand. We were grateful to be there.
There was nowhere else to be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>As in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) early marriage, Oskar was still temperamentally an absentee, was away from
Brinnlitz for stretches of time. Sometimes Stern, purveyor of the day's requests, would
wait up all night for him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). In Oskar's apartment Itzhak and Emilie were the keepers of
vigils.
The scholarly accountant would always put the most
loyal interpretation on Oskar's wanderings around
Moravia. In a speech years after, Stern would
say, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) rode day and night, not only
to purchase food for the Jews in Brinnlitz
camp--by means of forged papers made by one of the
prisoners--but to buy us arms and ammunition in
case the SS conceived of killing us during their
retreats.''  (<font color='red'><b>Stern/Itzhak Stern/Itzhak</b></font>)</div>The picture of a restlessly
provident Herr Direktor does credit
to Itzhak's love and loyalty. But Emilie
would have understood that not all the absences had to do with Oskar's brand of humane
racketeering.
During one of Oskar's furloughs, nineteen-year-old Janek Dresner was accused of
sabotage. In fact Dresner was ignorant of metalwork. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) time in
P@lasz@ow in the delousing works, handing towels to the SS who came for a shower
and sauna, and boiling lice-ridden clothes taken from prisoners. -LRB-from the bite of a louse
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d suffered typhus, and survived only because his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) cousin, Dr. Schindel, passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) off
in the clinic as an angina case.-RRB-
The supposed sabotage occurred because engineer Schoenbrun, the German supervisor,
transferred him (<font color='blue'><b>supervisor</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>supervisor</b></font>) lathe to one of the larger metal presses. It had taken a week for
the engineers to set the metrics for this machine, and the first time Dresner pressed the
start button and began to use it, he (<font color='blue'><b>supervisor</b></font>) shorted the wiring and cracked one of the plates.
Schoenbrun harangued the boy and went into the office to write a damning report.
Copies of Schoenbrun's complaint were typed up and addressed to Sections D and W in
Oranienburg, to Hassebroeck at Gr@oss-Rosen, and to Untersturmf@uhrer Liepold in his (<font color='blue'><b>supervisor</b></font>)
office at the factory gate.
In the morning, Oskar had still not come home. So rather than mail the reports, Stern took
them out of the office mailbag and hid them. The complaint addressed to Liepold had
already been hand-delivered, but Liepold was at least correct in the terms of the
organization he (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) served and could not hang the boy until he (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) had heard from Oranienburg
and Hassebroeck. Two days later, Oskar had still not appeared. <div class="bookquote">``It must be some party!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the ones</b></font>)</div>the whimsical ones on the shop floor told each other. Somehow Schoenbrun discovered
that Itzhak was sitting on the letters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Itzhak</b></font>) raged through the office, telling Stern that .his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>)
name would be added to the reports. Stern seemed to be a man of limitless calm, and
when Schoenbrun finished he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) told the engineer that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) had removed the reports from the
mailbag because he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) thought the Herr Direktor should, as a matter of courtesy, be apprised
of their contents before they were mailed. The Herr Direktor, said Stern, would of course
be appalled to find out that a prisoner had done 10,000 RM. worth of damage to one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) machines. It seemed only just, said Stern, that Herr Schindler be given the chance to
add his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) own remarks to the report.
At last Oskar drove in through the gate.
Stern intercepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) about Schoenbrun's charges.
Untersturmf@uhrer Liepold had been waiting to see Schindler too and was eager to push
his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) authority inside the factory, to use the Janek Dresner case as a pretext. I will preside
over the hearing, Liepold told Oskar. You, Herr Direktor, will supply a signed statement
attesting to the extent of the damage. Wait a minute, Oskar told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). It's my machine
that's broken. I'm the one who'll preside.
Liepold argued that the prisoner was under the jurisdiction of Section D. But the
machine, replied Oskar, came under the authority of the Armaments Inspectorate.
Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) really couldn't permit a trial on the shop floor.
If Brinnlitz had been a garment or chemical factory, then perhaps it wouldn't have much
impact on production. But this was a munitions factory engaged in the manufacture of
secret components. <div class="bookquote">``I won't have my work force disturbed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar.
It was an argument Oskar won, perhaps because Liepold gave in. The
Untersturmf@uhrer was afraid of Oskar's contacts. So the court was convened at night in
the machine-tool section of DEF, and its members were Herr Oskar Schindler as
president, Herr Schoenbrun, and Herr Fuchs. A young German girl sat at the side of the
judicial table to keep a record, and when young Dresner was brought in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fuchs</b></font>) saw in front
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fuchs</b></font>) a solemn and fully constituted court. According to a Section D edict of April 11,
1944, what Janek faced was the first and crucial stage of a process which should, after a
report to Hassebroeck and a reply from Oranienburg, end in his (<font color='blue'><b>Janek</b></font>) hanging on the workshop
floor in front of all the Brinnlitz people, his (<font color='blue'><b>Janek</b></font>) parents and sister among them. Janek noticed
that tonight there was none of that shop-floor familiarity to Oskar. The Herr Direktor read
aloud Schoenbrun's report of the sabotage. Janek knew about Oskar mainly from the
reports of others, particularly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Janek</b></font>) father, and couldn't tell now what Oskar's
straight-faced reading of Schoenbrun's accusations meant. Was Oskar really grieving for
the cracked machine? Or was it all just theatrics?
When the reading was finished, the Herr Direktor began to ask questions. There was not
much Dresner could say in answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) pleaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was unfamiliar with the machine.
There had been trouble setting it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) explained. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had been too anxious and had made a
mistake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) assured the Herr Direktor that he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) had no reason to wish to sabotage the
machinery. If you are not skilled at armaments work, said Schoenbrun, you shouldn't be
here. The Herr Direktor has assured me that all you prisoners have had experience in the
armaments industry. Yet here you are, H@aftling Dresner, claiming ignorance.
With an angry gesture, Schindler ordered the prisoner to detail exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had done
on the night of the offense. Dresner began to talk about the preparations for starting up
the machine, the setting of it, the dry run at the controls, the switching on of the power,
the sudden racing of the engine, the splitting of the mechanism. Herr Schindler became
more and more restless as Dresner talked, and began to pace the floor glowering at the
boy. Dresner was describing some alteration he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had made to one of the controls when
Schindler stopped, ham fists clenched, his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) eyes glaring. What did you say? he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) asked the
boy.
Dresner repeated what he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had said: I adjusted the pressure control, Herr Direktor.
Oskar walked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) and hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) across the side of the jaw. Dresner's head sang, but
in triumph, for Oskar--his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) fellow judges--had winked at Dresner in a way
that could not be mistaken. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) began waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) great arms, dismissing the boy.
<div class="bookquote">``The stupidity of you damned people!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was bellowing all the while. <div class="bookquote">``I can't believe
it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) turned and appealed to Schoenbrun and Fuchs, as if they were his (<font color='blue'><b>Fuchs</b></font>) only allies. <div class="bookquote">``I wish
they were intelligent enough to sabotage a machine. Then at least I'd have their
goddamned hides! But what can you do with these people? They're an utter waste of
time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar's fist clenched again, and Dresner recoiled at the idea of another roundhouse
punch. <div class="bookquote">``Clear out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>yelled Oskar.
As Dresner went out through the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) heard Oskar tell the others that it was better to
forget all this. <div class="bookquote">``I have some good Martell upstairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said.
This deft subversion may not have satisfied Liepold and Schoenbrun. For the sitting had
not reached a formal conclusion; it had not ended in a judgment. But they could not
complain that Oskar had avoided a hearing, or treated it with levity. Dresner's account,
given later in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) life, raises the supposition that Brinnlitz maintained its prisoners' lives
by a series of stunts so rapid that they were nearly magical. To tell the strict truth though,
Brinnlitz, both as a prison and as a manufacturing enterprise, was itself, of its nature and
in a literal sense, the one sustained, dazzling, integral confidence trick.

<p/>CHAPTER 35
For the factory produced nothing. <div class="bookquote">``Not a shell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brinnlitz prisoners</b></font>)</div>Brinnlitz prisoners will still say, shaking
their heads. Not one 45mm shell manufactured there could be used, not one rocket
casing. Oskar himself contrasts the output of DEF in the Cracow years with the Brinnlitz
record. In Zablocie, enamelware was manufactured to the value of 16,000,000 RM.
During the same time, the munitions section of
Emalia produced shells worth 500,000
RM. Oskar explains that at Brinnlitz,
however, <div class="bookquote">``as a consequence of the falling off of the enamel production,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brinnlitz</b></font>)</div>there was no
output to speak of. The armaments production, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) says, encountered <div class="bookquote">``start-up
difficulties.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But in fact he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) did manage to ship one truckful of <div class="bookquote">``ammunition parts,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>valued at 35,000 RM., during the Brinnlitz months. <div class="bookquote">``These parts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar later, ``had
been transferred to Brinnlitz already half-fabricated. To supply still less -LSB-to the war
effort-RSB- was impossible, and the excuse of ``start-up difficulties<div class="bookquote">'' became more and more
dangerous for me and my Jews, because Armaments Minister Albert Speer raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Speer</b></font>)
demands from month to month.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>The danger of Oskar's policy of nonproduction was not only that it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) a bad name
at the Armaments Ministry. It made other managements angry. For the factory system
was fragmented, one workshop producing the shells, another the fuses, a third packing in
the high explosives and assembling the components. In this way, it was reasoned, an air
raid on any one factory could not substantially destroy the flow of arms. Oskar's shells,
dispatched by freight to factories farther down the line, were inspected there by engineers
Oskar did not know and could not reach. The Brinnlitz items always failed quality
control. Oskar would show the complaining letters to Stern, to Finder, to Pemper or
Garde. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would laugh uproariously, as if the men writing the reprimands were comicopera
bureaucrats.
Later in the camp's history one such case occurred. Stern and Mietek Pemper were in
Oskar's office on the morning of April 28, 1945, a morning when the prisoners stood at
an extremity of danger, having been, as will be seen, all condemned to death by
Sturmbannf@uhrer Hassebroeck. The day was Oskar's thirty-seventh birthday, and a
bottle of cognac had already been opened to mark it. And on the desk lay a telegram from
the armaments assembly plant near Brno. It said that Oskar's antitank shells were so
badly produced that they failed all quality-control tests. They were imprecisely
calibrated, and because they had not been tempered at the right heat they split under
testing.
Oskar was ecstatic at this telegram, pushing it toward Stern and Pemper, making them
read it. Pemper remembers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) made another of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) outrageous statements. <div class="bookquote">``It's the
best birthday present I could have got. Because I know now that no poor bastard has been
killed by my product.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This incident says something about two contrasting frenzies.
There is some madness in a manufacturer like Oskar who rejoices when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) does not
manufacture. But there is also a cool lunacy in the German technocrat who, Vienna
having fallen, Marshal Koniev's men having embraced the Americans on the Elbe, still
takes it for granted that an arms factory up in the hills has time to tidy up its performance
and make a condign offering to the grand principles of discipline and output.
But the main question that arises from the birthday telegram is how Oskar lasted those
months, the seven months up to the date of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) birthday. The Brinnlitz people remember
a whole series of inspections and checks. Men from Section D stalked the factory,
checklists in their hands. So did engineers from the Armaments Inspectorate.
Oskar always lunched or dined these officials,
softened them up with ham and cognac. In the Reich
there were no longer so many good lunches and dinners
to be had. The prisoners at the lathes, the
furnaces, the metal presses would state that the
uniformed inspectors reeked of liquor and
reeled on the factory floor. There is a
story all the inmates tell of an official who
boasted, on one of the final inspections of the war, that
Schindler would not seduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) with camaraderie,
with a lunch and liquor. On the stairs leading from the
dormitories down to the workshop floor, the
legend has it, Oskar tripped the man, sending
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to the bottom of the stairs, a journey that
split the man's head and broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) leg. The
Brinnlitz people are, however, generally unable to say
who the SS hard case was. One claims that it
was Rasch, SS and police chief of
Moravia. Oskar himself never made any
recorded claim about it. The anecdote is one
of those stories that reflect on people's picture of
Oskar as a provider who covers all
possibilities. And one has to admit, in
natural justice, that the inmates had the right to spread this sort of fable. They were the
ones in deepest jeopardy. If the fable let them down, they would pay for it most bitterly.
One reason Brinnlitz passed the inspections was the relentless trickery of Oskar's skilled
workers. The furnace gauges were rigged by the electricians. The needle registered the
correct temperature when the interior of the furnace was in fact hundreds of degrees
cooler. <div class="bookquote">``I've written to the manufacturers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar would tell the armaments inspectors.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would play the somber, baffled manufacturer whose profits were being eroded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
would blame the floor, the inferior German supervisors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) spoke yet again of <div class="bookquote">``start-up
difficulties,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>implying future tonnages of munitions once the problems faded.
In the machine-tool departments, as at the furnaces, everything looked normal. Machines
seemed perfectly calibrated, but were in fact a micromillimeter off. Most of the arms
inspectors who walked through seem to have left not only with a gift of cigarettes and
cognac, but with a faint sympathy for the thorny problems this decent fellow was
enduring.
Stern would always say in the end that Oskar bought boxes of shells from other Czech
manufacturers and passed them off as his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) own during inspections. Pfefferberg makes the
same claim. In any case, Brinnlitz lasted, whatever sleight-of-hand Oskar used.
There were times when, to impress the hostile
locals, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) invited important officials in
for a tour of the factory and a good dinner. But they were
always men whose expertise did not run to engineering and
munitions production. After the Herr
Direktor's stay in Pomorska Street,
Liepold, Hoffman, and the local Party
Kreisleiter wrote to every official they could
think of--local, provincial, Berlin-based--
complaining about him (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) morals, his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) connections, his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>)
breaches of race and penal law. Sussmuth let
him (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) know about the barrage of letters arriving at
Troppau. So Oskar invited Ernst Hahn
down to Brinnlitz. Hahn was second in command
of the bureau of the Berlin main office devoted
to services for SS families. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) was,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>says Oskar with customary reprobate's
primness, <div class="bookquote">``a notorious drunkard.''  (<font color='red'><b>reprobate</b></font>)</div>With him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) Hahn brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Hahn</b></font>) boyhood friend Franz
Bosch. Bosch, as Oskar has already remarked in this narrative, was also <div class="bookquote">``an
impenetrable drunkard.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was also the murderer of the Gutter family. Oskar, however,
swallowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) contempt, welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) public-relations value. When Hahn
arrived in town, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hahn</b></font>) was wearing exactly the splendid, untarnished uniform Oskar had
hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would. It was festooned with ribbons and orders, for Hahn was an old-time SS
man from the early glory days of the Party. With this dazzling Standartenf@uhrer came
an equally glittering adjutant.
Liepold was invited in, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) rented house outside camp walls, to dine with the
visitors. From the start of the evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) depth. For Hahn loved Oskar;
drunks always did.
Later Oskar would describe the men and the uniforms as <div class="bookquote">``pompous.''  (<font color='red'><b>the men uniforms</b></font>)</div>But at least Liepold
was convinced now that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wrote complaining letters to distant authorities, they were
likely to land on the desk of some old drinking friend of the Herr Direktor's, and that this
could well be perilous to himself.
In the morning, Oskar was seen driving through Zwittau, laughing with these glamorous
men from Berlin. The local Nazis stood on the pavements and saluted all this Reich
splendor as it passed.
Hoffman was not as easily quelled as the rest. The three hundred women of Brinnlitz
had, in Oskar's own words, <div class="bookquote">``no employment possibility.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>It has already been said that
many of them spent their days knitting. In the winter of 1944, for people whose only
cover was the striped uniform, knitting was no idle hobby. Hoffman, however, made a
formal complaint to the SS about the wool the Schindler women had stolen from the
cases in the annex. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) thought it scandalous, and that it showed up the true activities of
the so-called Schindler munitions works.
When Oskar visited Hoffman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) found the old man in a triumphant mood. <div class="bookquote">``We've
petitioned Berlin to remove you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hoffman</b></font>)</div>said Hoffman. <div class="bookquote">``This time we've included sworn
statements declaring that your factory is running in contravention of economic and race
law. We've nominated an invalided Wehrmacht engineer from Brno to take over the
factory and turn it into something decent.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar listened to Hoffman, apologized, tried to appear penitent. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) telephoned
Colonel Erich Lange in Berlin and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to sit on the petition from the Hoffman
clique in Zwittau. The out-of-court settlement still cost Oskar 8,000 RM., and all winter
the Zwittau town authorities, civil and Party, plagued him (<font color='blue'><b>Party</b></font>), calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Party</b></font>) in to the town hall
to acquaint him (<font color='blue'><b>Party</b></font>) with the complaints of various citizens about his (<font color='blue'><b>Party</b></font>) prisoners, or the state of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Party</b></font>) drains.
Lusia the optimist had a personal experience of SS inspectors that typifies the Schindler
method.
Lusia was still in the cellar--she (<font color='blue'><b>optimist</b></font>) would be there for the entire winter. The other girls had
got better and had moved upstairs to recuperate. But it seemed to Lusia that Birkenau had
filled her (<font color='blue'><b>optimist</b></font>) with a limitless poison. Her (<font color='blue'><b>optimist</b></font>) fevers recurred again and again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>optimist</b></font>) joints became
inflamed. Carbuncles broke out in her (<font color='blue'><b>optimist</b></font>) armpits. When one burst and healed, another
would form. Dr. Handler, against the advice of Dr. Biberstein, lanced some of them with
a kitchen knife. She (<font color='blue'><b>optimist</b></font>) remained in the cellar, well fed, ghost-white, infectious. In all the
great square mileage of Europe, it was the only space in which she (<font color='blue'><b>optimist</b></font>) could have lived. She (<font color='blue'><b>optimist</b></font>)
was aware of that even then, and hoped that the enormous conflict would roll by above
her (<font color='blue'><b>optimist</b></font>) head.
In that warm hole under the factory, night and day were irrelevant. The time the door at
the top of the cellar stairs burst open could have been either. She (<font color='blue'><b>optimist</b></font>) was used to quieter
visits from Emilie Schindler. She (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) heard boots on the stairs and tensed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) bed. It
sounded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) like an old-fashioned Aktion.
It was in fact the Herr Direktor with two officers from Gr@oss-Rosen. Their boots
clattered on the steps as if to stampede over her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>). Oskar stood with them as they looked
around in the gloom at the boilers and at her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>). It came to Lusia that perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was it for
today. The sacrificial offering you had to give them so that they would go away satisfied.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was partially hidden by a boiler, but Oskar made no attempt to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>), actually
came to the foot of her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) bed.
Because the two gentlemen of the SS seemed flushed
and unsteady, Oskar had a chance to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
were words of wonderful banality, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) would never
forget them: <div class="bookquote">``Don't worry. Everything's all
right.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) stood close, as if to emphasize
to the inspectors that this was not an
infectious case.
<div class="bookquote">``This is a Jewish girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said flatly.
<div class="bookquote">``I didn't want to put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in the
Krankenstube. Inflammation of the joints. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s finished anyway. They don't give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
more than thirty-six hours.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) rambled on about the hot water, where it came from, and the steam for the
delousing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) pointed to gauges, piping, cylinders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) edged around her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) bed as if it too
were neutral, part of the mechanism. Lusia did not know where to look, whether to open
or close her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) tried to appear comatose. It might seem a touch too much, but
Lusia did not think so at the time, that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) ushered the SS men back to the base of the
stairs, Oskar flashed her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) a cautious smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) would stay there for six months and
hobble upstairs in the spring to resume her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) womanhood in an altered world.
During the winter, Oskar built up an independent arsenal. Again there are the legends:
Some say that the weapons were bought at the end of
winter from the Czech underground. But Oskar had been
an obvious National Socialist in 1938 and
1939 and may have been wary of dealing with the
Czechs. Most of the weapons, in any case,
came from a flawless source, from
Obersturmbannf@uhrer Rasch, SS and
police chief of Moravia. The small cache included carbines and automatic weapons, some
pistols, some hand grenades. Oskar would later describe the transaction offhandedly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
acquired the arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``under the pretense of protecting my factory, for the
price of the gift of a brilliant ring to his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) -LSB-Rasch's-RSB- wife.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Oskar does not detail his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) performance in Rasch's office in Brno's Spilberk Castle. It is
not hard to imagine, though. The Herr Direktor, concerned about a possible slave uprising
as the war grinds on, is willing to die expensively at his (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) desk, automatic weapon in hand,
having mercifully dispatched his (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) wife with a bullet to save her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from something worse.
The Herr Direktor also touches on the chance that the Russians might turn up at the gate.
My civilian engineers, Fuchs and
Schoenbrun, my honest technicians, my
German-speaking secretary, all of them
deserve to have the means of resistance. It's gloomy talk, of course. I'd rather speak of
issues closer to our hearts, Herr Obersturmbannf@uhrer. I know your passion for good
jewelry. May I show you this example I found last week?
And so the ring appeared on the edge of Rasch's blotter, Oskar murmuring, <div class="bookquote">``As soon as I
saw it, I thought of Frau Rasch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Once Oskar had the weapons, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) appointed Uri Bejski, brother of the rubber-stamp
maker, keeper of the arsenal. Uri was small, handsome, lively. People noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Uri</b></font>)
wandered into and out of the Schindlers' private quarters like a son. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was a favorite,
too, with Emilie, who gave him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) keys to the apartment. Frau Schindler enjoyed a similar
maternal relationship with the surviving Spira boy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) regularly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>)
kitchen and fed him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) up on slices of bread and margarine.
Having selected the small body of prisoners for training, Uri took one at a time into
Salpeter's storehouse to teach them the mechanisms of the Gewehr 41 W's. Three
commando squads of five men each had been formed. Some of Bejski's trainees were
boys like Lutek Feigenbaum. Others were Polish veterans such as Pfefferberg and those
other prisoners whom the Schindler prisoners called the <div class="bookquote">``Budzyn people.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Schindler prisoners</b></font>)</div>The Budzyn people were Jewish officers and men of the Polish Army. They had lived
through the liquidation of the Budzyn labor camp, which had been under the
administration of Untersturmf@uhrer Liepold. Liepold had brought them into his (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) new
command in Brinnlitz. There were about 50 of them, and they worked in Oskar's
kitchens. People remember them as very political. They had learned Marxism during their
imprisonment in Budzyn, and looked forward to a Communist Poland. It was an irony
that in Brinnlitz they lived in the warm kitchens of that most apolitical of capitalists, Herr
Oskar Schindler.
Their rapport with the bulk of the prisoners, who,
apart from the Zionists, merely followed the
politics of survival, was good. A number of
them took private lessons on Uri
Bejski's automatics, for in the Polish
Army of the Thirties they had never held such sophisticated weapons.
If Frau Rasch, in the last and fullest
days of her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) husband's power in Brno, had idly
--during a party, say; a musical recital
at the castle--gazed into the core of the diamond that had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) from Oskar
Schindler, she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) would have seen reflected there the worst incubus from her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) own dreams
and her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) F@uhrer's. An armed Marxist Jew.

<p/>CHAPTER 36
Old drinking friends of Oskar's, Amon and
Bosch among them, had sometimes thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) as the
victim of a Jewish virus. It was no
metaphor. They believed it in virtually
literal terms and attached no blame to the sufferer. They'd seen it happen to other good
men. Some area of the brain fell under a thrall that was half-bacterium, half-magic. If
they'd been asked whether it was infectious, they would have said, yes, highly. They
would have seen the case of Oberleutnant Sussmuth as an example of conspicuous
contagion.
For Oskar and Sussmuth connived over the winter
of 1944-45 to get a further 3,000 women out
of Auschwitz in groups of 300 to 500 at a
time into small camps in Moravia. Oskar
supplied the influence, the sales talk, the
palm-greasing for these operations. Sussmuth did the
paperwork. In the textile mills of Moravia
there was a labor shortage, and not all the owners
abhorred the Jewish presence as sharply as
Hoffman. At least five German factories
in Moravia--at Freudenthal and
Jagerndorf, at Liebau, Grulich, and
Trautenau--took these drafts of women and supplied a camp on the premises. Any such
camp was never paradise, and in its management the SS were permitted to be more
dominant than Liepold could ever hope to be. Oskar would later describe these women in
the little camps as <div class="bookquote">``living under endurable treatment.''  (<font color='red'><b>these women</b></font>)</div>But the very smallness of the
textile camps was an aid to their survival, for the SS garrisons were older, slacker, less
fanatical men. There was typhus to be eluded, and hunger to be carried like a weight
beneath the ribs. But such tiny, almost countrified establishments would for the most part
escape the extermination orders that would come to the bigger camps in the spring.
But if the Jewish sepsis had infected Sussmuth, for Oskar Schindler it galloped. Through
Sussmuth, Oskar had applied for another 30 metalworkers. It is simple fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had
lost interest in production. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) saw, with the detached side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) mind, that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) plant
was ever to validate its existence to Section D, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would need more qualified hands.
When you look at other events of that mad winter, you can see that Oskar wanted the
extra 30 not because they were used to lathes and machine tools, but because they were
simply an extra 30. It is not too fantastic to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) desired them with some of the
absolute passion that characterized the exposed and flaming heart of the Jesus which
hung on Emilie's wall. Since this narrative has tried to avoid the canonization of the Herr
Direktor, the idea of the sensual Oskar as the desirer of souls has to be proved.
One of these 30 metalworkers, a man named Moshe Henigman, left a public account of
their unlikely deliverance. A little after Christmas, 10,000 prisoners from the quarries of
Auschwitz III--FROM such establishments as the Krupp Weschel-Union armaments
factory and from German Earth and Stone, from the Farben synthetic-petroleum plant and
the airplane-dismantling enterprise--were put in a column and marched away toward
Gr@oss-Rosen. Perhaps some planner believed that once they arrived in Lower Silesia,
they would be distributed among the area's factory camps. If that was the scheme, it
escaped the SS officers and men who marched with the prisoners. It ignored also the
devouring cold of the merciless turning of the year, and it did not inquire how the column
would be fed. The limpers, the coughers were culled out at the beginning of each stage
and executed. Of 10,000, says Henigman, there were within ten days only 1,200 left
alive. To the north, Koniev's Russians had burst across the Vistula south of Warsaw and
seized all the roads on the column's northwesterly route. The diminished group was
therefore put in an SS compound somewhere near Opole. The Commandant of the place
had the prisoners interviewed, and lists made of the skilled workers. But each day the
weary selections continued, and the rejects were shot. A man whose name was called out
never knew what to expect, a lump of bread or a bullet. When Henigman's name was
called, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was put in a railway car with 30 others and, under the care of an SS
man and a Kapo, was shunted south. <div class="bookquote">``We were given food for the trip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henigman</b></font>)</div>Henigman
recalls. <div class="bookquote">``Something unheard of.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Henigman</b></font>)</div>Henigman later spoke of the exquisite unreality of arriving at Brinnlitz. <div class="bookquote">``We could not
believe that there was a camp left where men and women worked together, where there
were no beatings, no Kapo.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Kapo</b></font>) reaction is marked by a little hyperbole, since there was
segregation in Brinnlitz. Occasionally, too, Oskar's blond girlfriend let fly with an open
palm, and once when a boy stole a potato from the kitchen and was reported to Liepold,
the Commandant made him (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) stand on a stool all day in the courtyard, the potato clamped
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) open mouth, saliva running down his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) chin, and the placard <div class="bookquote">``I AM A POTATO
THIEF!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>hung around his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) neck. But to Henigman this sort of thing was not worthy of
report. <div class="bookquote">``How can one describe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) asks, <div class="bookquote">``the change from hell to paradise?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) met Oskar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) was told to build himself up. Tell the supervisors when you're
ready to work, said the Herr Direktor. And Henigman, faced with this strange reversal of
policy, felt not simply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>)'d come to a quiet pasture, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) had gone through the
mirror.
Since 30 tinsmiths were merely a fragment of the 10,000, it must be said again that Oskar
was only a minor god of rescue. But like any tutelary spirit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) saved equally Goldberg
and Helen Hirsch, and equally he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) tried to save Dr. Leon Gross and Olek Rosner. With
this same gratuitous equality, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) made a costly deal with the Gestapo in the Moravia
region. We know that the contract was struck, but we do not know how expensive it was.
That it cost a fortune is certain.
A prisoner named Benjamin Wrozlawski became one subject of this deal. Wrozlawski
was formerly an inmate of the labor camp at Gliwice. Unlike Henigman's camp, Gliwice
was not in the Auschwitz region, but was close enough to be one of the Auschwitz
subsidiary camps. By January 12, when Koniev and Zhukov launched their offensive,
H@oss's awesome realm and all its close satellites were in danger of instant capture. The
Gliwice prisoners were put in Ostbahn cars and shipped toward Fernwald. Somehow
Wrozlawski and a friend named Roman Wilner jumped from the train. One popular form
of escape was through loosened ventilators in the cars' ceilings. But prisoners who tried it
were often shot by guards stationed on the roofs. Wilner was wounded during this escape,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) was able to travel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) friend Wrozlawski fled through the high quiet
towns of the Moravian border. They were at last arrested in one of these villages and
taken to the Gestapo offices in Troppau.
As soon as they had arrived and been searched and put in a cell, one of the gentlemen of
the Gestapo walked in and told them that nothing bad would happen. They had no reason
to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>). The officer said further that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) would not transfer Wilner to a hospital, in
spite of the wound, for he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) would simply be collected and fed back into the system.
Wrozlawski and Wilner were locked away for nearly two weeks. Oskar had to be
contacted and a price had to be settled. During that time, the officer kept talking to them
as if they were in protective custody, and the prisoners continued to find the idea absurd.
When the door was opened and the two of them were taken out, they presumed they were
about to be shot. Instead, they were led to the railway station by an SS man who escorted
them on a train southeast toward Brno.
For both of them, the arrival at Brinnlitz had that same surreal, delightful and frightening
quality it had had for Henigman. Wilner was put in the clinic, under the care of Doctors
Handler, Lewkowicz, Hilfstein, Biberstein. Wrozlawski was put in a sort of convalescent
area which had been set up--for extraordinary reasons soon to be explained--in a corner
of the factory floor downstairs. The Herr Direktor visited them and asked how they felt.
The preposterous question scared Wrozlawski; so did the surroundings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) feared, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>)
would put it years later, <div class="bookquote">``the way from the hospital would lead to execution, as was the
case in other camps.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) was fed with the rich Brinnlitz porridge, and saw Schindler
frequently. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) confesses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was still confused, and found the phenomenon of
Brinnlitz hard to grasp.
By the arrangement Oskar had with the provincial
Gestapo, 11 escapees were added to the
crammed-in camp population. Each one
of them had wandered away from a column or jumped from a cattle car. In their stinking
stripes, they had tried to stay at large. By rights, they should all have been shot.
In 1963, Dr. Steinberg of Tel Aviv testified to yet another instance of Oskar's wild,
contagious, and unquestioning largesse. Steinberg was the physician in a small work
camp in the Sudeten hills. The Gauleiter in Liberec was less able, as Silesia fell to the
Russians, to keep labor camps out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Steinberg</b></font>) wholesome province of Moravia. The camp in
which Steinberg was imprisoned was one of the many new ones scattered among the
mountains. It was a Luftwaffe camp devoted to the manufacture of some unspecified
aircraft component. Four hundred prisoners lived there. The food was poor, said
Steinberg, and the workload savage. Pursuing a rumor about the Brinnlitz camp,
Steinberg managed to get a pass and the loan of a factory truck to go and see Oskar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
described to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) the desperate conditions in the Luftwaffe camp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) says that Oskar
quite lightly agreed to allocate him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) part of the Brinnlitz stores. The main question that
preoccupied Oskar was, On what grounds could Steinberg regularly come to Brinnlitz to
pick up supplies? It was arranged that he (<font color='blue'><b>Steinberg</b></font>) would use some excuse to do with getting
regular medical aid from the doctors in the camp clinic.
Twice a week thereafter, says Steinberg, he (<font color='blue'><b>Steinberg</b></font>) visited Brinnlitz and took back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Steinberg</b></font>) own
camp quantities of bread, semolina, potatoes, and cigarettes. If Schindler was around the
storehouse on the day that Steinberg was loading up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Steinberg</b></font>) would turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Steinberg</b></font>) back and walk
away.
Steinberg does not give any exact poundage of food, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Steinberg</b></font>) offers it as a medical opinion
that if the Brinnlitz supplies had not been available, at least 50 of the prisoners in the
Luftwaffe camp would have died by the spring. Apart from the ransoming of the women
in Auschwitz, however, the most astounding salvage of all was that of the Golesz@ow
people. Golesz@ow was a quarry and cement plant inside Auschwitz III itself, home of
the SS'-OWNED German Earth and Stone Works. As has been seen with the 30
metalsmiths, throughout January 1945 the dread fiefdoms of Auschwitz were being
disbanded, and in mid-month 120 quarry workers from Golesz@ow were thrown into two
cattle cars. Their journey would be as bitter as any, but would end better than most. It is
worth remarking that, like the Golesz@ow men, nearly everyone else in the Auschwitz
area was on the move that month. Dolek Horowitz was shipped away to Mauthausen.
Young Richard, however, was kept behind with other small children. The Russians would
find him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) later in the month in an Auschwitz abandoned by the SS and would claim quite
correctly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) and the others had been detained for medical experiments.
Henry Rosner and nine-year-old Olek
-LRB-apparently no longer considered necessary for the laboratories-RRB- were marched away from
Auschwitz in a column for thirty miles, and those who fell behind were shot. In
Sosnowiec they were packed into freight cars. As a special kindness, an SS guard who
was supposed to separate the children let Olek and Henry go into the same car. It was so
crowded that everyone had to stand, but as men died of cold and thirst a gentleman whom
Henry described as <div class="bookquote">``a smart Jew''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Rosner/Henry Rosner</b></font>)</div>would suspend them in their blankets from horse hooks
near the roof. In this way there was more floor space for the living. For the sake of the
boy's comfort, Henry got the idea of slinging Olek in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) blanket in exactly the same way
from the horse hooks. This not only gave the child an easier ride; when the train stopped
at stations and sidings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would call to Germans by the rails to throw snowballs up to the
wire gratings. The snow would shatter and spray the interior of the wagon with moisture,
and men would struggle for a few ice crystals.
The train took seven days to get to Dachau, and half the population of the Rosners' car
died. When it at last arrived and the door was opened, a dead body fell out, and then
Olek, who picked himself up in the snow, broke an icicle off the undercarriage and began
to lick it ravenously. Such was travel in Europe in January 1945.
For the Golesz@ow quarry prisoners it was
even worse. The bill of lading for their two
freight cars, preserved in the archives of the
Yad Vashem, shows that they were traveling without
food for more than ten days andwiththe doors frozen
shut. R, a boy of sixteen, remembers that
they scraped ice off the inside walls to quench
their thirst. Even in Birkenau they
weren't unloaded. The killing process was in its
last furious days. It had no time for them. They
were abandoned on sidings, reattached
to locomotives, dragged for 50 miles,
uncoupled again. They were shunted to the gates of
camps, whose commandants refused them on the clear
ground that by now they lacked industrial value, and
because in any case facilities--bunks and rations
--were everywhere at the limit.
In the small hours of a morning at the end of January, they were uncoupled and
abandoned in the rail yards at Zwittau. Oskar says a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) telephoned from the
depot to report human scratchings and cries from inside the cars. These pleadings were
uttered in many tongues, for the trapped men were, according to the manifest, Slovenes,
Poles, Czechs, Germans, Frenchmen, Hungarians, Netherlanders, and Serbians. The
friend who made the call was very likely Oskar's brother-in-law. Oskar told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to shunt
the two cars up the siding to Brinnlitz.
It was a morning of gruesome cold--minus 30
degrees Celsius -LRB-minus 22 degrees
Fahrenheit-RRB-, says Stern. Even the exact
Biberstein says that it was at least minus 20 degrees -LRB-minus 4 degrees F-RRB-. Poldek
Pfefferberg was summoned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>) bunk, fetched his (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>) welding gear, and went out to the
snowy siding to cut open the doors iced hard as iron. He (<font color='blue'><b>Biberstein</b></font>) too heard the unearthly
complaints from within.
It is hard to describe what they saw when the
doors were at last opened. In each car, a
pyramid of frozen corpses, their limbs
madly contorted, occupied the center. The hundred or more still living stank awesomely,
were seared black by the cold, were skeletal. Not one of them would be found to weigh
more than 75 pounds.
Oskar was not at the siding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was inside the factory, where a warm corner of the
workshop floor was being made ready for the shipment from Golesz@ow. Prisoners
dismantled the last of Hoffman's dumped machinery and carried it to the garages. Straw
was brought in and the floor strewn with it.
Already Schindler had been out to the Commandant's
office to speak to Liepold. The
Untersturmf@uhrer didn't want to take
the Golesz@ow men; in that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) resembled all the other commandants they had met in the
past few weeks. Liepold remarked pointedly that no one could pretend that these people
were munitions workers. Oskar admitted that, but guaranteed to put them on the books,
and so to pay 6 RM. a day for each of them. <div class="bookquote">``I can use them after their recuperation,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>said Oskar. Liepold recognized two aspects of the case. First, that Oskar was
unstoppable. Second, that an increase in the size of Brinnlitz and the labor fees paid
might well please Hassebroeck. Liepold would have them quickly enrolled on the books
and the entries back-dated, so that even as the Golesz@ow men were carried in through
the factory gate, Oskar was paying for them.
Inside the workshop, they were wrapped in blankets and laid down on the straw. Emilie
came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) apartment, followed by two prisoners toting an enormous bucket of
porridge. The doctors noted the frostbite and the need for frost ointments. Dr. Biberstein
mentioned to Oskar that the Golesz@ow people would need vitamins, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was sure
there were none to be had in Moravia. In the meantime the 16 frozen corpses were
placed in a shed. Rabbi Levartov, looking at them, knew that with their limbs twisted by
the cold they would be hard to bury in the Orthodox manner, which permitted no
breaking of bones. The matter, Levartov knew, would, however, have to be argued with
the Commandant. Liepold had on file from Section D a number of directives urging SS
personnel to dispose of the dead by burning. In the boiler rooms were perfect facilities,
industrial furnaces capable almost of vaporizing a body. Yet Schindler had so far twice
refused to permit the burning of the dead.
The first time was when Janka Feigenbaum died
in the Brinnlitz clinic. Liepold had at
once ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) body incinerated. Oskar heard
through Stern that this was abhorrent to the Feigenbaums
and to Levartov, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) resistance to the idea may have
been fueled also by the Catholic residue in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
own soul. In those years the Catholic Church was
firmly opposed to cremation. As well as
refusing Liepold the use of the furnace,
Oskar also ordered the carpenters to prepare a coffin, and himself supplied a horse and
wagon, allowing Levartov and the family to ride out under guard to bury the girl in the
woods.
Feigenbaum father and son had walked behind the wagon, counting the steps from the
gate so that when the war ended they could reclaim Janka's body. Witnesses say that
Liepold was furious at this sort of pandering to the prisoners. Some Brinnlitz people
even comment that Oskar could show toward Levartov and the Feigenbaums a more
exacting delicacy and courtesy than he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) usually managed with Emilie.
The second time Liepold wanted the furnaces used was when old Mrs. Hofstatter died.
Oskar, at Stern's request, had another coffin prepared, allowing a metal plaque on which
Mrs. Hofstatter's vital statistics were marked to be included in the coffin. Levartov and a
minyan, the quorum of ten males who recite Kaddish over the dead, were permitted to
leave camp and attend the funeral.
Stern says that it was for Mrs. Hofstatter's sake that Oskar established a Jewish cemetery
in the Catholic parish of Deutsch-Bielau, a nearby village. According to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), Oskar went
to the parish church on the Sunday Mrs. Hofstatter died and made the priest a
proposition. A quickly convened parish council agreed to sell him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) a small parcel of land
just beyond the Catholic cemetery. There is nothing surer than that some of the council
resisted, for it was an era when Canon Law was interpreted narrowly in its provisions as
to who could and who could not be buried in consecrated ground.
Other prisoners of some authority say, however, that the Jewish cemetery plot was
bought by Oskar at the time of the arrival of the Golesz@ow cars with their tithe of
twisted dead. In a later report, Oskar himself implies that it was the Golesz@ow dead
who caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to buy the land. By one account, when the parish priest pointed out the
area beyond the church wall reserved for the burial of suicides and suggested that the
Golesz@ow people be buried there, Oskar answered that these weren't suicides. These
were victims of a great murder. The Golesz@ow deaths and the death of Mrs. Hofstatter
must have come close together in any case, and were both marked with full ritual in the
unique Jewish cemetery of Deutsch-Bielau.
It is clear from the way all Brinnlitz prisoners spoke of it that this interment had
enormous moral force within the camp. The distorted corpses who were unloaded from
the freight cars had seemed less than human. Looking at them, you became frightened for
your own precarious humanity. The inhuman thing was beyond feeding, washing,
warming. The one way left to restore it--as well as yourself--to humanity was through
ritual. Levartov's rites, therefore, the exalted plainchant of Kaddish, had a far larger
gravity for the Brinnlitz prisoners than such ceremonies could ever have had in the
relative tranquillity of prewar Cracow.
To keep the Jewish burial ground tidy in
case of future deaths, Oskar employed a
middle-aged SS Unterscharf@uhrer and
paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) a retainer.
Emilie Schindler had transactions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
own to make. Carrying a clutch of false papers supplied by Bejski, she (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) had two prisoners
load up one of the plant trucks with vodka and cigarettes, and ordered them to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
to the large mining town of Ostrava up near the border of the Government General. At
the military hospital she (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was able to make an arrangement with various of Oskar's
contacts and to bring back frostbite ointments, sulfa, and the vitamins Biberstein had
thought beyond procuring. Such journeys now became regular events for Emilie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) was
growing to be a traveler, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) husband.
After the first deaths, there were no others. The
Golesz@ow people were Mussulmen, and it was a first
principle that the condition of Mussulmen could not
be reversed. But there was some intractability in
Emilie which would not accept it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) harried them with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) bucketfuls of farina. <div class="bookquote">``Out of those rescued from
Golesz@ow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Biberstein/Dr. Alexander Biberstein/Alexander Biberstein</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Biberstein, <div class="bookquote">``not one
would have stayed alive without her (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) treatment.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Biberstein/Dr. Alexander Biberstein/Alexander Biberstein</b></font>)</div>The men
began to be seen, trying to look useful, on the
factory floor. One day a Jewish storeman
asked one of them to carry a box out to a machine on
the workshop floor. <div class="bookquote">``The box weighs
thirty-five kilos,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, <div class="bookquote">``and I
weigh thirty-two. How in the hell can I carry it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>To this factory of ineffective machines, its floor strewn with scarecrows, Herr Amon
Goeth came that winter, following his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) release from prison, to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) respects to the
Schindlers. The SS court had let him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) out of prison in Breslau because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) diabetes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
was dressed in an old suit that may have been a uniform with the markings stripped off.
There are rumors about the meaning of this visit, and they persist to this day. Some
thought that Goeth was looking for a handout, others that Oskar was holding something
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)--cash or kind from one of Amon's last Cracow deals in which Oskar had
perhaps served as Amon's agent. Some who worked close to Oskar's office believe that
Amon even asked for a managerial post at Brinnlitz. No one could say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) did not
have the experience. In fact, all three versions of Amon's motives in coming down to
Brinnlitz are possibly correct, though it is unlikely that Oskar ever acted as Amon's
agent.
As Amon stepped through the gate of the camp, it could be seen that prison and
tribulation had thinned him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) down. The fleshiness had vanished from his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) face. His (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
features were more like those of the Amon who had come to Cracow in the New Year of
1943 to liquidate the ghetto, yet they were different too, for they were jaundice-yellow
and prison-gray. And if you had the eyes for it, if you dared to look, you saw a new
passivity there. Some prisoners, however, glancing up from their lathes, glimpsed that
figure from the pit of their foulest dreams, there unannounced, passing by the doors and
windows, proceeding through the factory yard toward Herr Schindler's office. Helen
Hirsch sat galvanized, wanting nothing except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) should vanish again. But others
hissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) passed, and men bent at their machines and spat. More mature women
lifted their knitting toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) like a challenge. For that was vengeance-- to show that in
spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) terror, Adam still delved and Eve span.
If Amon wanted a job at Brinnlitz-- and there were few other places a
Hauptsturmf@uhrer under suspension could go--Oskar either talked him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) out of it or
bought him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) off. In that way, this meeting was like all their others.
As a courtesy the Herr Direktor took
Amon on a tour of the plant, and on this
circuit of the workshop floor, the reaction against him (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was stronger still. Back in the
office, Amon was overheard demanding that Oskar punish the inmates for their
disrespect, and Oskar was heard rumbling away, pledging that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would do something
about the pernicious Jews and expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) own undiminished respect for Herr Goeth.
Though the SS had let him (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) out of prison, the investigation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Goeth</b></font>) affairs was still in
progress. A judge of the SS Court had come to Brinnlitz in the past few weeks to question
Mietek Pemper again about Amon's managerial procedures.
Before the interrogation began, Commandant Liepold had muttered to Pemper that he (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>)'d
better be careful, that the judge would want to take him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) to Dachau for execution after
he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)'d been drained of evidence. Wisely, Pemper had done all he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) could to convince the
judge of the unimportance of his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) work in the main office at P@lasz@ow.
Somehow, Amon had heard that the SS investigators had been pursuing Pemper. Soon
after he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) arrived in Brinnlitz, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) cornered his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) ci-devant typist in Oskar's outer office and
wanted to know what questions the judge had asked. Pemper believed, reasonably
enough, that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) could detect in Amon's eyes resentment that his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) onetime prisoner was
still a breathing source of evidence for the SS Court. Surely Amon was powerless here,
thinned down, looking doleful in an old suit, washed up in Oskar's office? But you
couldn't be sure. It was still Amon, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had the habit of authority. Pemper said, <div class="bookquote">``The
judge told me I was not to talk to anyone about my interrogation.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pemper/Mietek Pemper/Mietek</b></font>)</div>Goeth was outraged
and threatened to complain to Herr Schindler. That, if you like, was a measure of Amon's
new impotence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had never had to go to Oskar before to appeal for the chastisement of
a prisoner.
By the second night of Amon's visit, the women were feeling more triumphant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>)
couldn't touch them. They persuaded even Helen Hirsch of this. Yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Hirsch</b></font>) sleep was
uneasy.
The last time Amon passed within sight of prisoners, it was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) way to be taken by car
to the station at Zwittau. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) had never in the past made three visits to any space without
bringing some poor bastard's world crashing down. It was clear now that he (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) had no
power at all. Yet still not everyone could look him (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) in the face as he (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) left. Thirty years
later, in the sleep of P@lasz@ow veterans from Buenos Aires to Sydney, from New York
to Cracow, from Los Angeles to Jerusalem, Amon would still be rampaging. <div class="bookquote">``When you
saw Goeth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pfefferberg/Poldek Pfefferberg/Poldek</b></font>)</div>said Poldek Pfefferberg, <div class="bookquote">``you saw death.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pfefferberg/Poldek Pfefferberg/Poldek</b></font>)</div>So, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) own terms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was never an utter failure.

<p/>CHAPTER 37
Oskar's thirty-seventh birthday was celebrated by Oskar himself and all the prisoners.
One of the metalworkers had crafted a small box
suitable for holding studs or cuff links, and when
the Herr Direktor appeared on the workshop
floor, the twelve-year-old Niusia
Horowitz was pushed toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) to make a
rehearsed speech in German. <div class="bookquote">``Herr
Direktor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) said in a voice he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) had
to stoop to hear. <div class="bookquote">``All the prisoners wish you the very best for this your birthday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Brinnlitz people</b></font>)</div>It was a Shabbat, which was apt, because the Brinnlitz people would always remember it
as a festival. Early in the morning, about the time Oskar had begun celebrating with
Martell cognac in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) office and flourishing that insulting telegram from the engineers at
Brno, two truckloads of white bread rolled into the courtyard. Some went to the garrison,
even to the hung-over Liepold sleeping late in his (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) house in the village. That much was
necessary to stop the SS from grumbling about the way the Herr Direktor favored
prisoners. The prisoners themselves were issued three-quarters of a kilo of the bread.
They inspected it as they ate and savored it. There was some speculation about where
Oskar had got it. Perhaps it could be partially explained by the goodwill of the local mill
manager, Daubek, the one who turned away while Brinnlitz prisoners filled their pants
with oatmeal. But that Saturday bread was truly celebrated more in terms of the magic of
the event, of the wonder-working. Though the day is remembered as jubilant, there was
in fact not so much cause for festive feeling. Sometime in the past week, a long telegram
had been directed from Herr Commandant Hassebroeck of Gr@oss-Rosen to Liepold of
Brinnlitz giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) instructions about the disposal of the population in the event the
Russians drew near. There was to be a final selection, said Hassebroeck's telegram. The
aged and the halt were to be shot immediately, and the healthy were to be marched out in
the direction of Mauthausen. Though the prisoners on the factory floor knew nothing of
this telegram, they still had an unspecified fear of something like it. All that week there
had been rumors that Poles had been brought in to dig mass graves in the woods beyond
Brinnlitz. The white bread seemed to have come as an antidote to that rumor, a warranty
of all their futures. Yet everyone seemed to know that an era of dangers more subtle than
those of the past had begun.
If Oskar's factory hands knew nothing of the telegram, neither did Herr Commandant
Liepold himself. The cable was delivered first to Mietek Pemper in Liepold's outer
office. Pemper had steamed it open and resealed it and taken the news of its contents
straight to Oskar. Schindler stood at his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) desk reading it, then turned to Mietek. <div class="bookquote">``All right,
then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>growled Oskar. <div class="bookquote">``We have to say goodbye to Untersturmf@uhrer Liepold.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>For it seemed both to Oskar and to Pemper that Liepold was the only SS man in the
garrison capable of obeying such a telegram. The Commandant's deputy was a man in his (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>)
forties, an SS Oberscharf@uhrer named Motzek.
While Motzek might be capable of some sort of panic slaughter, to administer the cool
murder of 1,300 humans was beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>).
In the days before his (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) birthday, Oskar made a number of confidential complaints to
Hassebroeck about the excessive behavior of Herr Commandant Liepold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) visited the
influential Brno police chief, Rasch, and lodged the same sort of charges against Liepold.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) showed both Hassebroeck and Rasch copies of letters he (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) had written to the office of
General Gl@ucks in Oranienburg. Oskar was gambling that Hassebroeck would
remember Oskar's past generosities and the promise of future ones, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would take
note of the pressure for Liepold's removal now being built up by Oskar in Oranienburg
and Brno, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would transfer Liepold without bothering to investigate the
Untersturmf@uhrer's behavior toward the inmates of Brinnlitz.
It was a characteristic Schindler maneuver--the
Amon-Oskar game of blackjack writ
large. All the Brinnlitz men were in the
stake, from Hirsch Krischer, Prisoner
No. 68821, a forty-eight-year-old
auto mechanic, to Jarum Kiaf,
Prisoner No. 77196, a twentyseven-year-old
unskilled worker and
survivor of the Golesz@ow carriages. And
all the Brinnlitz women were counted in as well,
from No. 76201, twenty-nine-yearold
metalworker Berta Aftergut, to No.
76500, thirty-six-year-old Jenta
Zwetschenstiel.
Oskar got fuel for further complaints about
Liepold by inviting the Commandant to dinner at the
apartment inside the factory. It was April
27, the eve of Schindler's birthday. About
eleven o'clock that night, the prisoners at work on
the floor of the plant were startled to see a drunken
Commandant reeling across the factory floor,
assisted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) way by a steadier Herr
Direktor. In the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) passage,
Liepold attempted to focus on individual
workers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) raged, pointing at the great roof
beams above the machinery. The Herr
Direktor had so far kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) off the
factory floor, but here he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) was, the final and punishing authority. <div class="bookquote">``You fucking Jews,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>)
was roaring. <div class="bookquote">``See that beam, see it! That's what I'll hang you from. Every one of you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar eased him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) along, directing him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) by the shoulder, murmuring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``That's right,
that's right. But not tonight, eh? Some other time.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The next day Oskar called
Hassebroeck and others with predictable accusations. The man rages around the factory
drunk, making threats about immediate executions. They're not laborers! They're
sophisticated technicians engaged in secret-weapons manufacture, and so on. And
although Hassebroeck was responsible for the deaths of thousands of quarry workers,
although he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) believed that all Jewish labor should be liquidated when the Russians were
close, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) did agree that until then Herr Schindler's factory should be treated as a special
case.
Liepold, said Oskar, kept stating that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d like at last to go into combat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'s young, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'s
healthy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'s willing. Well, Hassebroeck told Oskar, we'll see what can be done.
Commandant Liepold himself, meanwhile, spent Oskar's birthday sleeping off the dinner
of the night before.
In his (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) absence, Oskar made an astounding
birthday speech. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had been celebrating all
day, yet no one remembers his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) delivery being
unsteady. We do not have the text of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said,
but there is another speech, made ten days later
on the evening of May 8, of which we do have a
copy. According to those who listened, both speeches
pursued similar lines. Both were, that is,
promises of continuing life.
To call either of them a speech, however, is
to demean their effect. What Oskar was
instinctively attempting was to adjust reality,
to alter the self-image of both the prisoners and the
SS. Long before, with pertinacious certainty,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>)'d told a group of shift workers, Edith
Liebgold among them, that they would last the war.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>)'d flourished the same gift for prophecy
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) faced the women from Auschwitz, on their
morning of arrival the previous November, and
told them, <div class="bookquote">``You're safe now; you're with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>It can't be ignored that in another age and condition,
the Herr Direktor could have become a
demagogue of the style of Huey Long of
Louisiana or John Lang of Australia,
whose gift was to convince the listeners that they and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lang</b></font>) were
bonded together to avert by a whisker all the evil
devised by other men.
Oskar's birthday speech was delivered in
German at night on the workshop floor to the
assembled prisoners. An SS detachment had
to be brought in to guard a gathering of that size, and the
German civilian personnel were present as
well. As Oskar began to speak, Poldek
Pfefferberg felt the hairs on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) lice stand
to attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) looked around at the mute faces
of Schoenbrun and Fuchs, and of the SS men with their
automatics. They will kill this man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
thought. And then everything will fall apart.
The speech pursued two main promises.
First, the great tyranny was coming to a close. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
spoke of the SS men around the walls as if they
too were imprisoned and yearned for liberation. Many
of them, Oskar explained to the prisoners, had
been conscripted from other units and without their consent
into the Waffen SS. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) second promise was
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would stay at Brinnlitz until the end of the
hostilities was announced. <div class="bookquote">``And five minutes
longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said. For the prisoners, the speech, like
past pronouncements of Oskar's, promised a
future. It stated his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) vigorous intent that they should
not go into graves in the woods. It reminded them of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) investment in them, and it enlivened them.
One can only guess, however, how it bedeviled
the SS men who heard it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had genially
insulted their corps. How they protested, or
whether they swallowed it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would learn from their
reaction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had also warned them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would stay
in Brinnlitz at least as long as they would, and that
therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was a witness.
But Oskar did not feel as blithe as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
sounded. Later he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) confessed that at the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was
concerned about actions retreating military units in
the Zwittau area might take in regard
to Brinnlitz. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) even says, <div class="bookquote">``We were in a
panic, because we were afraid of the despairing
actions of the SS guards.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>It must have been a
quiet panic, for no prisoner, eating his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) white
bread on Oskar's birthday, seems to have caught
a whiff of it. Oskar was also concerned about some
Vlasov units which had been stationed on the edges
of Brinnlitz. These troops were members of the
ROA, the Russian Army of Liberation, formed
the year before on the authority of Himmler from the
vast ranks of Russian prisoners in the
Reich and commanded by General Andrei Vlasov, a
former Soviet general captured in front of
Moscow three years past. They were a dangerous
corps for the Brinnlitz people, for they knew Stalin
would want them for a special punishment and feared that
the Allies would give them back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stalin</b></font>). Vlasov
units everywhere were therefore in a state of violent
Slavic despair, which they stoked with vodka.
When they withdrew, seeking the American lines
farther west, they might do anything.
Within two days of Oskar's birthday speech,
a set of orders arrived on Liepold's
desk. They announced that
Untersturmf@uhrer Liepold had been
transferred to a Waffen SS infantry
battalion near Prague. Though Liepold
could not have been delighted with them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) seems to have
packed quietly and left. He (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) had often said at
dinners at Oskar's, particularly after the
second bottle of red wine, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would prefer
to be in a combat unit. Lately there had been a
number of field-rank officers, Wehrmacht
and SS, from the retreating forces invited to dinner in
the Herr Direktor's apartment, and their table
talk had always been to stir Liepold's itch
to seek combat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) had never been faced with as much
evidence as the other guests that the cause was
finished.
It is unlikely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) called
Hassebroeck's office before packing his (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) bags.
Telephone communications were not sound, for the
Russians had encircled Breslau and were within a
walk of Gr@oss-Rosen itself. But the transfer
would not have surprised anyone in Hassebroeck's
office, since Liepold had often
made patriotic sounds to them too. So, leaving
Oberscharf@uhrer Motzek in command of
Brinnlitz, Josef Liepold drove off
to battle, a hard-liner who had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) wish.
With Oskar, there was no mute waiting for the
close. During the first days of May, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
discovered somehow--perhaps even by telephone calls
to Brno, where lines were still operating--that one of the
warehouses with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) regularly dealt had been
abandoned. With half a dozen prisoners, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
drove off by truck to loot it. There were a number
of roadblocks on the way south, but at each of
them they flashed their dazzling papers, forged, as
Oskar would write, with the stamps and signatures
<div class="bookquote">``of the highest SS police authorities in Moravia and Bohemia.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>When they arrived at the
warehouse, they found it encircled by fire. Military storehouses in the neighborhood had
been set alight, and there had been incendiary bombing raids as well. From the direction
of the inner city, where the Czechoslovak underground was fighting door to door with the
garrison, they could hear firing. Herr Schindler ordered the truck to back into the loading
dock of the warehouse, broke the door open, and discovered that the interior was full of a
brand of cigarettes called Egipski.
In spite of such lighthearted piracy,
Oskar was frightened by rumors from Slovakia that the Russians were uncritically and
informally executing German civilians. From listening to the BBC news each night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
was comforted to find that the war might end before any Russian reached the Zwittau
area.
The prisoners also had indirect access to the
BBC and knew what the realities were. Throughout
the history of Brinnlitz the radio
technicians, Zenon Szenwich and Artur
Rabner, had continually repaired one or another radio of Oskar's. In the welding shop,
Zenon listened with an earphone to the 2 P.m. news from the Voice of London. During
the night shift, the welders plugged into the 2 A.m. broadcast. An SS man, in the factory
one night to take a message to the office, discovered three of them around the radio.
<div class="bookquote">``We've been working on it for the Herr Direktor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>they told the man, <div class="bookquote">``and just got it
going a minute ago.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Earlier in the year, prisoners had expected that Moravia would be taken by the
Americans. Since Eisenhower had stood fast at the Elbe, they now knew that it would be
the Russians. The circle of prisoners closest to Oskar were composing a letter in Hebrew,
explaining what Oskar's record was. It might do some good if presented to American
forces, which had not only a considerable Jewish component, but field rabbis. Stern and
Oskar himself therefore considered it vital that the Herr Direktor somehow be got to the
Americans. In part Oskar's decision was influenced by the characteristic Central
European idea of the Russians as barbarians, men of strange religion and uncertain
humanity. But apart from that, if some of the reports from the east could be believed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
had grounds for rational fear.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was not debilitated by it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was awake
and in a state of hectic expectation when the news
of the German surrender came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) through the BBC
in the small hours of May 7. The war in
Europe was to cease at midnight on the following
night, the night of Tuesday, May 8. Oskar
woke Emilie, and the sleepless Stern was
summoned into the office to help the Herr
Direktor celebrate. Stern could tell that
Oskar now felt confident about the SS
garrison, but would have been alarmed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) could have guessed how Oskar's certitude
would be demonstrated that day.
On the shop floor, the prisoners maintained
the usual routines. If anything, they worked
better than on other days. Yet about noon, the
Herr Direktor destroyed the pretense of
business as usual by piping Churchill's
victory speech by loudspeaker throughout the camp.
Lutek Feigenbaum, who understood English,
stood by his (<font color='blue'><b>Feigenbaum</b></font>) machine flabbergasted. For others, the
honking and grunting voice of Churchill was the first
they'd heard in years of a language they would
speak in the New World. The idiosyncratic
voice, as familiar in its way as that of the dead
F@uhrer, carried to the gates and assailed the
watchtowers, but the SS took it soberly. They
were no longer turning inward toward the camp. Their
eyes, like Oskar's, were focused--but far more
sharply--on the Russians. According
to Hassebroeck's earlier telegram, they should
have been busy in the rich green woods. Instead,
clock-watching for midnight, they looked at the
black face of the forest, speculating whether
partisans were there. A fretful
Oberscharf@uhrer Motzek kept them at
their posts, and duty kept them there also. For duty, as so many of their superiors would
claim in court, was the SS genius.
In those uneasy two days, between the declaration of peace and its accomplishment, one
of the prisoners, a jeweler named Licht, had been making a present for Oskar, something
more expressive than the metal stud box he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d been given on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) birthday. Licht was
working with a rare quantity of gold. It had been supplied by old Mr.
Jereth of the box factory. It was established-- even the Budzyn men, devout Marxists,
knew it--that Oskar would have to flee after midnight. The urge to mark that flight with
a small ceremony was the preoccupation of the group--Stern, Finder, Garde, the Bejskis,
Pemper--close to Oskar. It is remarkable, at a time when they were not sure themselves
that they would see the peace, that they should worry about going-away presents.
All that was handy to make a gift with, however, was base metals. It was Mr. Jereth who
suggested a source of something better. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jereth</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Jereth</b></font>) mouth to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Jereth</b></font>) gold
bridgework. Without Oskar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said, the SS would have the damned stuff anyway. My
teeth would be in a heap in some SS warehouse, along with the golden fangs of strangers
from Lublin, @l@od@z, and Lw@ow.
It was, of course, an appropriate offering, and Jereth was insistent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had the bridgework
dragged out by a prisoner who had once had a dental practice in Cracow. Licht melted the
gold down and by noon on May 8 was engraving an inscription on the inner circle in
Hebrew. It was a Talmudic verse which Stern had quoted to Oskar in the front office of
Buchheister's in October 1939. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) who saves a single life saves the world entire.''
 (<font color='red'><b>prisoners</b></font>)</div>In one of the factory garages that afternoon, two
prisoners were engaged in removing the upholstery from
the ceiling and inner doors of Oskar's Mercedes,
inserting small sacks of the Herr
Direktor's diamonds and replacing the
leatherwork without, they hoped, leaving any bulges. For them too it was a strange day.
When they came out of the garage, the sun was setting behind the towers where the
Spandaus sat loaded yet weirdly ineffectual. It was as if all the world were waiting for a
decisive word.
Words of that nature seem to have come in the evening. Again, as on his (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) birthday, Oskar
instructed the Commandant to gather the prisoners on the factory floor. Again the
German engineers and the secretaries, their escape plans already made, were present.
Among them stood Ingrid, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) old flame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>) would not be leaving Brinnlitz in
Schindler's company. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>) would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>) escape with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingrid</b></font>) brother, a young war veteran,
lame from a wound. Given that Oskar went to so much trouble to provide his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) prisoners
with trade goods, it is unlikely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would let an old love like Ingrid leave Brinnlitz
without anything to barter for survival. Surely they would meet on friendly terms later,
somewhere in the West.
As at Oskar's birthday speech, armed guards stood around the great hall. The war had
nearly six hours to run, and the SS were sworn never to abandon it in any case. Looking
at them, the prisoners tried to gauge their states of soul. When it was announced that the
Herr Direktor would make another address, two women prisoners who knew shorthand,
Miss Waidmann and Mrs. Berger, had each fetched a pencil and prepared to take down
what was said. Because it was an ex tempore speech, given by a man who knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would soon become a fugitive, it was more compelling as spoken than it is on the page in
the Waidmann-Berger version. It continued the themes of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) birthday address, but it
seemed to make them conclusive for both the prisoners and the Germans. It declared the
prisoners the inheritors of the new era; it confirmed that everyone else there--the SS,
himself, Emilie, Fuchs, Schoenbrun--was now in need of rescue.
<div class="bookquote">``The unconditional surrender of Germany,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fuchs</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``has just been announced. After six
years of the cruel murder of human beings, victims are being mourned, and Europe is
now trying to return to peace and order. I would like to turn to you for unconditional
order and discipline--to all of you who together with me have worried through many
hard years-- in order that you can live through the present and within a few days go back
to your destroyed and plundered homes, looking for survivors from your families. You
will thus prevent panic, whose results cannot be foreseen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fuchs</b></font>) did not, of course, mean panic in the
prisoners. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fuchs</b></font>) meant panic among the
garrison, among the men lining the walls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fuchs</b></font>) was inviting the SS to leave, and the
prisoners to let them do so. General Montgomery, he (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) said, the commander of the Allied
land forces, had proclaimed that one should act in a humane way toward the conquered,
and everyone--in judging the Germans--had to distinguish between guilt and duty. <div class="bookquote">``The
soldiers at the front, as well as the little man who has done his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty everywhere, shall not
be responsible for what a group calling itself German has done.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) was uttering a
defense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) countrymen which every prisoner who survived the night would hear
reiterated a thousand times in the era to come. Yet if anyone had earned the right to make
that defense and have it listened to with--at least--tolerance, it was surely Herr Oskar
Schindler.
<div class="bookquote">``The fact that millions among you, your parents, children, and brothers, have been
liquidated has been disapproved by thousands of Germans, and even today there are
millions of them who do not know the extent of these horrors.''  (<font color='red'><b>BBC</b></font>)</div>The documents and
records found in Dachau and Buchenwald earlier in the year, their details broadcast by
the BBC, were the first, said Oskar, that many a German had heard of <div class="bookquote">``this most
monstrous destruction.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) therefore begged them once again to act in a humane and just
way, to leave justice to those authorized. <div class="bookquote">``If you have to accuse a person, do it in the
right place. Because in the new Europe there will be judges, incorruptible judges, who
will listen to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Next he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) began to speak about his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) association with the prisoners in the
past year. In some ways he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) sounded almost nostalgic, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) feared as well being judged
in a lump with the Goeths and the Hassebroecks.
<div class="bookquote">``Many of you know the persecutions, the chicanery and obstacles which, in order to keep
my workers, I had to overcome through many years. If it was already difficult to defend
the small rights of the Polish worker, to maintain work for him (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) and to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) from
being sent by force to the Reich, to defend the workers' homes and their modest property,
then the struggle to defend the Jewish workers has often seemed insurmountable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) described some of the difficulties, and thanked them for their help in satisfying the
demands of the armaments authorities. In view of the lack of output from Brinnlitz, the
thanks may have sounded ironic. But they were not offered in an ironic way. What the
Herr Direktor was saying in a quite literal sense was Thank you for helping me make a
fool of the system.
He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) went on to appeal for the local people. ``If after a few days here the doors of freedom
are opened to you, think of what many of the people in the neighborhood of the factory
have done to help you with additional food and clothing. I have done everything and
spent every effort in getting you additional food, and I pledge to do the utmost in the
future to protect you and safeguard your daily bread. I shall continue doing everything I
can for you until five minutes past midnight.
``Don't go into the neighboring houses to rob and plunder. Prove yourselves worthy of the
millions of victims among you and refrain from any individual acts of revenge and
terror.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) confessed that the prisoners had never been welcome in the area. ``The Schindler Jews
were taboo in Brinnlitz.'' But there were higher concerns than local vengeance. ``I entrust
your Kapos and foremen to continue keeping up order and continued understanding.
Therefore tell your people of it, because this is in the interest of your safety. Thank the
mill of Daubek, whose help in getting you food went beyond the realms of possibility. On
behalf of you, I shall now thank the brave director Daubek, who has done everything to
get food for you. <div class="bookquote">``Don't thank me for your survival. Thank your people who worked day
and night to save you from extermination. Thank your fearless Stern and Pemper and a
few others who, thinking of you and worrying about you, especially in Cracow, have
faced death every moment. The hour of honor makes it our duty to watch and keep order,
as long as we stay here together. I beg of you, even among yourselves, to make nothing
but humane and just decisions. I wish to thank my personal collaborators for their
complete sacrifice in connection with my work.''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) speech, weaving from issue to issue,
exhausting some ideas, returning tangentially to others, reached the center of its temerity.
Oskar turned to the SS garrison and thanked them for resisting the barbarity of their
calling. Some prisoners on the floor thought, He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'s asked us not to provoke them? What is
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) doing himself! For the SS was the SS, the corps of Goeth and John and Hujar and
Scheidt. There were things an SS man was taught, things he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did and saw, which marked
the limits of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) humanity.
Oskar, they felt, was dangerously pushing the limits.
<div class="bookquote">``I would like,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to thank the assembled
SS guards, who without being asked were ordered from the Army and Navy into this
service. As heads of families, they have realized for a long time the contemptibility and
senselessness of their task. They have acted here in an extraordinarily humane and correct
manner.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>What the prisoners did not see, aghast if a little exalted by the Herr Direktor's nerve, was
that Oskar was finishing the work he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d begun on the night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) birthday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was
destroying the SS as combatants. For if they stood there and swallowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) version of
what was <div class="bookquote">``humane and correct,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>then there was nothing more left to them but to walk
away. <div class="bookquote">``In the end,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I request you all to keep a three-minute silence, in memory
of the countless victims among you who have died in these cruel years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). Oberscharf@uhrer Motzek and Helen Hirsch; Lusia, who had come up
from the cellar only in the past week; and Schoenbrun, Emilie, and Goldberg. Those
itching for time to pass, those itching to flee. Keeping silent among the giant Hilo
machines at the limit of the noisiest of wars.
When it was over, the SS left the hall quickly. The prisoners remained. They looked
around and wondered if they were at last the possessors. As Oskar and Emilie moved
toward their apartment to pack, prisoners waylaid them. Licht's ring was presented.
Oskar spent some time admiring it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) showed the inscription to Emilie and asked Stern
for a translation. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) asked where they had got the gold and discovered it was
Jereth's bridgework, they expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) to laugh; Jereth was among the presentation
committee, ready to be teased and already flashing the little points of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) stripped teeth.
But Oskar became very solemn and slowly placed the ring on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) finger. Though nobody
quite understood it, it was the instant in which they became themselves again, in which
Oskar Schindler became dependent on gifts of theirs.

<p/>CHAPTER 38
In the hours following Oskar's speech the SS garrison began to desert. Inside the factory,
the commandos selected from the Budzyn people and from other elements of the prison
population had already been issued the weapons Oskar had provided. It was hoped to
disarm the SS rather than wage a ritual battle with them. It would not be wise, as Oskar
had explained, to attract any retreating and embittered units to the gate. But unless
something as outlandish as a treaty was arrived at, the towers would ultimately have to be
stormed with grenades.
The truth, however, was that the commandos had only to formalize the disarming
described in Oskar's speech. The guards at the main gate gave up their weapons almost
gratefully. On the darkened steps leading up to the SS barracks, Poldek Pfefferberg and a
prisoner named Jusek Horn disarmed Commandant Motzek, Pfefferberg putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>)
finger in the man's back and Motzek, like any sane man over forty with a home to go to,
begging them to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Pfefferberg took the Commandant's pistol, and Motzek, after
a short detention during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Commandant</b></font>) cried out for the Herr Direktor to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>), was
released and began to walk home.
The towers, about which Uri and the other irregulars must have spent hours of
speculation and scheming, were discovered abandoned. Some prisoners, newly armed
with the garrison's weapons, were put up there to indicate to anyone passing by that the
old order still held sway here.
When midnight came, there were no SS men or women visible in the camp. Oskar called
Bankier to the office and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) the key to a particular storeroom. It was a naval
supply store and had been situated, until the Russian offensive into Silesia, somewhere in
the Katowice area. It must have existed to supply the crews of river and canal patrol
boats, and Oskar had found out that the Armaments Inspectorate wanted to rent storage
space for it in some less threatened area. Oskar got the storage contract--<div class="bookquote">``with the help
of some gifts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) said later. And so eighteen trucks loaded with coat, uniform, and
underwear fabric, with worsted yarn and wool, as well as with a half a million reels of
thread and a range of shoes, had entered the Brinnlitz gate and been unloaded and stored.
Stern and others would declare that Oskar knew the stores would remain with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) at the
end of the war and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) intended the material to provide a starting stake for his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
prisoners. In a later document, Oskar claims the same thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had sought the storage
contract, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``with the intention of supplying my Jewish prot@eg`es at the end of the
war with clothing. ... Jewish textile experts estimated the value of my clothing store at
more than $150,000 U.s. -LRB-peace currency-RRB-.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had in Brinnlitz men capable of making such a judgment--Juda Dresner, for example,
who had owned his (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) own textile business in Stradom Street; Itzhak Stern, who had worked
in a textile company across the road. For the rite of passing over this expensive key to
Bankier, Oskar was dressed in prisoner's stripes, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wife, Emilie. The reversal
toward which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)'d been working since the early days of DEF was visibly complete.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) appeared in the courtyard to say goodbye, everyone thought it a lightly put on
disguise, which would be lightly taken off again once he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) encountered the Americans. The
wearing of the coarse cloth was, however, an act that would never completely be laughed
off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) would in a most thorough sense always remain a hostage to Brinnlitz and Emalia.
Eight prisoners had volunteered to travel with Oskar and Emilie. They were all very
young, but they included a couple, Richard and Anka Rechen. The oldest was an engineer
named Edek Reubinski, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rechen</b></font>) was still nearly ten years younger than the Schindlers.
Later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rechen</b></font>) would supply the details of their eccentric journey.
Emilie, Oskar, and a driver were meant to occupy the Mercedes. The others would follow
in a truck loaded with food and with cigarettes and liquor for barter. Oskar seemed
anxious to be away. One arm of Russian threat, the Vlasovs, was gone. They had
marched out in the past few days. But the other, it was presumed, would be in Brinnlitz
by the next morning, or even sooner. From the back seat of the Mercedes, where Emilie
and Oskar sat in their prison uniforms--not, it had to be admitted, much like prisoners;
more like bourgeoisie off to a masquerade ball--Oskar still rumbled out advice for Stern,
orders to Bankier and Salpeter. But you could tell he (<font color='blue'><b>Salpeter</b></font>) wanted to be off. Yet when the
driver, Dolek Gr@unhaut, tried to start the Mercedes, the engine was dead. Oskar
climbed out of the back seat to look under the hood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was alarmed--a different man
from the one who'd given the commanding speech a few hours before. <div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
kept asking. But it was hard for Gr@unhaut to say in the shadows. It took him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) a little
time to find the fault, for it was not one he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) expected. Someone, frightened by the idea of
Oskar's departure, had cut the wiring.
Pfefferberg, part of the crowd gathered to wave the Herr Direktor off, rushed to the
welding shop, brought back his (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) gear, and went to work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) was sweating and his (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) hands
seemed clumsy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) was rattled by the urgency he (<font color='blue'><b>Direktor</b></font>) could sense in Oskar. Schindler
kept looking at the gate as if the Russians might at any second materialize. It was not an
improbable fear-- others in the courtyard were tormented by the same ironic
possibility--and Pfefferberg worked too hard and took too long. But at last the engine
caught to Gr@unhaut's frantic turning of the key.
Once the engine turned over, the Mercedes left, the truck following it. Everyone was too
unnerved to make formal goodbyes, but a letter, signed by Hilfstein and Stern and
Salpeter, attesting to Oskar's and Emilie's record, was handed to the Schindlers. The
Schindler convoy rolled out the gate and, at the road by the siding, turned left toward
Havl@i@ck@uv Brod and toward what was for Oskar the safer end of Europe. There
was something nuptial about it, for Oskar, who had come to Brinnlitz with so many
women, was leaving with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wife. Stern and the others remained standing in the
courtyard. After so many promises, they were their own people. The weight and
uncertainty of that must now be borne.
The hiatus lasted three days and had its history and its dangers. Once the SS left, the only
representative of the killing machine left in Brinnlitz was a German Kapo who had come
from Gr@oss-Rosen with the Schindler men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was a man with a murderous record in
Gr@oss-Rosen itself, but one who had also made enemies in Brinnlitz. A pack of male
prisoners now dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) bunk down to the factory hall and enthusiastically
and mercilessly hanged him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) from one of the same beams with which Untersturmf@uhrer
Liepold had recently threatened the prison population. Some inmates tried to intervene,
but the executioners were in a rage and could not be stopped. It was an event, this first
homicide of the peace, which many Brinnlitz people would forever abhor. They had seen
Amon hang poor engineer Krautwirt on the Appellplatz at P@lasz@ow, and this
hanging, though for different reasons, sickened them as profoundly. For Amon was
Amon and beyond altering. But these hangmen were their brothers. When the Kapo
ceased his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapo</b></font>) twitching, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kapo</b></font>) was left suspended above the silenced machines. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kapo</b></font>) perplexed
people, though. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kapo</b></font>) was supposed to gladden them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Kapo</b></font>) threw doubt. At last some men
who had not hanged him (<font color='blue'><b>Kapo</b></font>) cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Kapo</b></font>) down and incinerated him (<font color='blue'><b>Kapo</b></font>). It showed what an eccentric
camp Brinnlitz was, that the only body fed into the furnaces which, by decree, should
have been employed to burn the Jewish dead was the corpse of an Aryan. The
distribution of the goods in the Navy store went on throughout the next day. Lengths of
worsted material had to be cut from the great bolts of fabric. Moshe Bejski said that each
prisoner was given three yards, together with a complete set of underwear and some reels
of cotton. Some women began that very day to make the suits in which they would travel
home. Others kept the fabric intact so that, traded, it would keep them alive in the
confused days to come.
A ration of the Egipski cigarettes which Oskar had plundered from burning Brno was also
issued, and each prisoner was given a bottle of vodka from Salpeter's storehouse. Few
would drink it.
It was, of course, simply too precious
to drink.
After dark on that second night, a Panzer unit came down the road from the direction of
Zwittau. Lutek Feigenbaum, behind a bush near the gate and armed with a rifle, had the
urge to fire as soon as the first tank passed within sight of the camp. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Feigenbaum</b></font>) considered it
rash. The vehicles rattled past. A gunner in one of the rear tanks in the column,
understanding that the fence and the watchtowers meant that Jewish criminals might be
lying low in there, swiveled his (<font color='blue'><b>Feigenbaum</b></font>) gun and sent two shells into the camp. One exploded in
the courtyard, the other on the women's balcony. It was a random exhibition of spite, and
through wisdom or astonishment none of the armed prisoners answered it.
When the last tank had vanished, the men of the commandos could hear mourning from
the courtyard and from the women's dormitory upstairs. A girl had been wounded by
shell fragments. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) herself was in shock, but the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) injuries had released in the
women all the barely expressed grief of the past years. While the women mourned, the
Brinnlitz doctors examined the girl and found that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wounds were superficial.
Oskar's party traveled for the first hours of their
escape at the tail of a column of
Wehrmacht trucks. At midnight feats of
this nature had become feasible, and no one pestered
them. Behind them they could hear German engineers
dynamiting installations, and occasionally there was the
clamor of a distant ambush arranged by the Czech
underground. Near the town of Havl@i@ck@uv
Brod they must have fallen behind, because they were stopped
by Czech partisans who stood in the middle of the
road. Oskar went on impersonating a
prisoner. <div class="bookquote">``These good people and I are escapees from
a labor camp. The SS fled, and the Herr
Direktor. This is the Herr
Direktor's automobile.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The Czechs</b></font>)</div>The Czechs asked them if they had weapons. Reubinski had come from the truck and
joined the discussion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) confessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had a rifle. All right, said the Czechs, you'd
better give us what you have. If the Russians intercepted you and found that you had
weapons, they might not understand why. Your defense is your prison uniforms.
In this town, southeast of Prague and on the road to Austria, there was still the likelihood
of meeting disgruntled units. The partisans directed Oskar and the others to the Czech
Red Cross office in the town square. There they could safely bunk down for the rest of
the night. But when they reached town, the Red Cross officials suggested to them that
given the uncertainty of the peace, they would probably be safest in the town jail. The
vehicles were left in the square, in sight of the Red Cross office, and Oskar, Emilie, and
their eight companions carried their few pieces of baggage and slept in the unlocked cells
of the police station.
When they returned to the square in the morning, they found that both vehicles had been
stripped.
All the upholstery had been torn from the
Mercedes, the diamonds were gone, the tires had
been taken from the truck, and the engines had been
plundered. The Czechs were
philosophical about it. We all have
to expect to lose something in times like these. Perhaps they may even have suspected
Oskar, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) fair complexion and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) blue eyes, of being a fugitive SS man.
The party were without their own transport, but a train ran south in the direction of
Kaplice, and they caught it, dressed still in their stripes. Reubinski says that they took the
train <div class="bookquote">``as far as the forest, and then walked.''  (<font color='red'><b>Reubinski/Edek Reubinski</b></font>)</div>Somewhere in that forested border region,
well to the north of Linz, they could expect to encounter the Americans. They were
hiking down a wooded road when they met two young gum-chewing Americans sitting
by a machine gun. One of Oskar's prisoners began to speak with them in English. <div class="bookquote">``Our
orders are not to let anyone pass on this road,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>one of them said.
<div class="bookquote">``Is it forbidden to circle around through the woods?''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div>asked the prisoner.
The GI chewed. This strange chewing race!
<div class="bookquote">``Guess not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the GI</b></font>)</div>said the GI at last.
So they swung through the woods and, back on the road half an hour later, ran into an
infantry company marching north in double column. Through the English speaker once
more, they began to talk to the unit's reconnaissance men. The commanding officer
himself drew up in a jeep, dismounted, interrogated them. They were frank with him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>),
telling him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) that Oskar was the Herr Direktor, that they were Jews. They believed they
were on safe ground, for they knew from the BBC that the U.s. forces included many
Americans of both German and Jewish origins. <div class="bookquote">``Don't move,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>said the captain. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) drove
away without explanation, leaving them in the half-embarrassed command of the young
infantrymen, who offered them cigarettes, the Virginia kind, which had that almost
glossy look--like the jeep, the uniforms, the equipment--of coming from a grand, brash,
unfettered, and un-ersatz manufactory.
Though Emilie and the prisoners were uneasy that Oskar might be arrested, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) himself sat
on the grass apparently unconcerned and breathed in the spring air in these high woods.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) Hebrew letter, and New York, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) knew, was ethnically a city where Hebrew
was not unknown. Half an hour passed and some soldiers appeared, coming down the
road in an informal bunch, not strung out in the infantry manner.
They were a group of Jewish infantrymen and included a field rabbi. They were very
effusive. They embraced all the party, Emilie and Oskar as well. For these, the party was
told, were the first concentration-camp survivors the battalion had met.
When the greetings were over, Oskar brought out his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) Hebrew reference, and the rabbi
read it and began to weep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) relayed the details to the other Americans. There was more
applause, more hand shaking, more embraces. The young GI'S seemed so open, so loud,
so childlike. Though one or two generations out of Central Europe, they had been so
marked by America that the Schindlers and the prisoners looked at them with as much
amazement as was returned.
The result was that the Schindler party spent two days on the Austrian frontier as guests
of the regimental commander and the rabbi. They drank excellent coffee, such as the
authentic prisoners in the group had not tasted since before the founding of the ghetto.
They ate opulently. After two days, the rabbi presented them with a captured ambulance,
in which they drove to the ruined city of Linz in Upper Austria.
On the second day of peace in Brinnlitz, the Russians still had not appeared. The
commando group worried about the necessity of hanging on to the camp for longer than
they had thought they'd have to. One thing they remembered was that the only time
they'd seen the SS show fear--apart from the anxiety of Motzek and his (<font color='blue'><b>rabbi</b></font>) colleagues in the
past few days--had been when typhus broke out.
So they hung typhus signs all over the
wire.
Three Czech partisans turned up at the
gate in the afternoon and talked through the fence to the men on sentry duty. It's all over
now, they said.
You're free to walk out whenever you want. When the Russians arrive, said the prison
commandos. Until then we're keeping everyone in. Their answer exhibited some of the
pathology of the prisoner, the suspicion you got after a time that the world outside the
fence was perilous and had to be reentered in stages. It also showed their wisdom. They
were not convinced yet that the last German unit had gone.
The Czechs shrugged and went away.
That night, when Poldek Pfefferberg was part of the guard at the main gate, motorcycle
engines were heard on the road. They did not pass by, as the Panzers had done, but could
be heard turning in toward the camp itself. Five cycles marked with the SS death's-head
materialized out of the dark and drew up noisily by the front fence. As the SS men--very
young, Poldek remembers-- switched off their engines, dismounted, and approached the
gate, a debate raged among the armed men inside as to whether the visitors ought to be
immediately shot.
The NCO in charge of the motorcycle party seemed to understand the risk inherent in the
situation. He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) stood a little way from the wire with his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hands extended. They needed
gasoline, he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) presumed that being a factory camp, Brinnlitz would have gasoline.
Pfefferberg advised that it was better to supply them and send them packing than to
create problems by opening fire on them. Other elements of their regiment might be in
the region, and be drawn by an outburst of gunfire.
So in the end the SS men were let in through the gate, and some of the prisoners went to
the garage and drew gasoline. The SS NCO was careful to convey to the camp
commandos--who had put on blue coveralls in an attempt to look like informal guards,
or at least like German Kapos--that he (<font color='blue'><b>NCO</b></font>) did not find anything peculiar in the idea of armed
prisoners' defending their camps from within. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you realize there's typhus here,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pfefferberg/Poldek Pfefferberg/Poldek</b></font>)</div>said Pfefferberg in German, pointing to the signs. The SS men looked at each other.
<div class="bookquote">``We've already lost two dozen people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pfefferberg/Poldek Pfefferberg/Poldek</b></font>)</div>said Pfefferberg. <div class="bookquote">``We have another fifty isolated
in the cellar.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>This claim seemed to impress the gentlemen of the death's-head. They were tired. They
were fleeing. That was enough for them. They didn't want any bacterial perils on top of
the others.
When the gasoline arrived in 5-gallon cans, they expressed their thanks, bowed, and left
through the gate. The prisoners watched them fill their tanks and considerately leave by
the wire any cans they could not fit into their sidecars. They put on their gloves, started
their engines, and left without too much revving of the motors, being too careful to waste
their new tankfuls on flourishes. Their roar faded southwest through the village. For the
men at the gate, this polite encounter would be their last with anyone wearing the uniform
of Heinrich Himmler's foul legion.
When on the third day the camp was liberated, it was by a single Russian officer. Riding
a horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) emerged through the defile through which the road and the railway siding
approached the Brinnlitz gate. As he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) drew closer it became apparent that the horse was a
mere pony, the officer's thin feet in the stirrups nearly touching the road and his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) legs bent
in comically underneath the horse's skinny abdomen. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) seemed to be bringing to
Brinnlitz a personal, hard-won deliverance, for his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) uniform was worn, the leather strap of
his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) rifle so withered by sweat and winter and campaigning that it had had to be replaced
by rope. The reins of the horse were also of rope. The officer was fair-complexioned
and, as Russians always look to Poles, immensely alien, immensely familiar.
After a short conversation in hybrid Polish-Russian, the commando at the gate let him (<font color='blue'><b>commando</b></font>) in.
Around the balconies of the second floor, the rumor of his (<font color='blue'><b>commando</b></font>) arrival spread. As he (<font color='blue'><b>commando</b></font>)
dismounted he (<font color='blue'><b>commando</b></font>) was kissed by Mrs. Krumholz. He (<font color='blue'><b>commando</b></font>) smiled and called, in two languages, for
a chair. One of the younger men brought it.
Standing on it to give himself a height
advantage which, in relation to most of the prisoners,
he (<font color='blue'><b>commando</b></font>) did not need, he (<font color='blue'><b>commando</b></font>) made what sounded like a
standard liberation speech in Russian. Moshe
Bejski could catch its gist. They had been
liberated by the glorious Soviets. They were
free to go to town, to move in the direction of their
choosing. For under the Soviets, as in the mythical
heaven, there was neither Jew nor Gentile, male
nor female, bond nor free. They were not
to take any cheap revenge in the town. Their
Allies would find their oppressors, and
subject them to solemn and appropriate
punishment. The fact of their freedom should, to them, outweigh any other consideration.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) got down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) chair and smiled, as if saying that now he (<font color='blue'><b>Gentile</b></font>) had finished as a
spokesman and was prepared to answer questions. Bejski and some of the others began to
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bejski</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bejski</b></font>) pointed to himself and said in creaky Belorussian Yiddish--the sort
you pick up from your grandparents rather than your parents --that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bejski</b></font>) was Jewish.
Now the conversation took on a new intimacy.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you been in Poland?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bejski/Moshe Bejski/Moshe</b></font>)</div>Bejski asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bejski</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>the officer admitted. <div class="bookquote">``I've come
from Poland now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are there any Jews left up there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I saw none.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Prisoners</b></font>)</div>Prisoners were crowding around, translating and relaying the conversation to one
another. <div class="bookquote">``Where are you from?''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>the officer asked Bejski.
<div class="bookquote">``Cracow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was in Cracow two weeks ago.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Auschwitz? What about Auschwitz?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I heard that at Auschwitz there are still a few Jews.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The prisoners</b></font>)</div>The prisoners grew thoughtful. The Russian made Poland sound like a vacuum now, and
if they returned to Cracow they'd rattle around in it bleakly like dried peas in a jar.
<div class="bookquote">``Is there anything I can do for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>the officer asked.
There were cries for food. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) could get them a cartload of bread, and perhaps
some horsemeat. It should arrive before dusk. <div class="bookquote">``But you should see what they have in
town here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>the officer suggested.
It was a radical idea--that they ought to just go out the gate and begin shopping in
Brinnlitz. For some of them it was still an unimaginable option. Young men like Pemper
and Bejski pursued the officer as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bejski</b></font>) left. If there were no Jews in Poland, there was
nowhere to go. They didn't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Bejski</b></font>) to give them instructions, but felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Bejski</b></font>) ought to
discuss their quandary with them. The Russian paused in untying the reins of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bejski</b></font>) pony
from a railing.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bejski</b></font>) said, looking them in the face. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know where you ought to go.
Don't go east--that much I can tell you. But don't go west either.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bejski</b></font>) fingers returned to
untying the knot. <div class="bookquote">``They don't like us anywhere.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>As the Russian officer had urged them, the Brinnlitz prisoners moved out the gate at last
to make their first tentative contact with the outer world. The young were the first to try
it. Danka Schindel went out the day after the liberation and climbed the wooded hill
behind the camp. Lilies and anemones were beginning to bud, and migratory birds were
arriving from Africa. Danka sat on the hill for a while, savoring the day, then rolled down
it and lay in the grass at the bottom, inhaling the fragrances and looking at the sky. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
was there for so long that her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) parents presumed she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had come to grief in the village, with
either the townspeople or the Russians.
Goldberg left early too, was perhaps the first to go, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) way to pick up his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) riches in
Cracow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) would emigrate, as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberg</b></font>) could arrange it, to Brazil.
Most of the older prisoners stayed in camp.
The Russians had now moved into Brinnlitz,
occupying as an officers' quarters a villa on
a hill above the village. They brought to the camp
a butchered horse, which the prisoners ate
ravenously, some of them finding it too rich after their
diet of bread and vegetables and Emilie
Schindler's porridge.
Lutek Feigenbaum, Janek Dresner, and
young Sternberg went foraging in town. The village was patrolled by the Czech
underground, and Brinnlitz folk of German descent were therefore wary of the liberated
prisoners. A grocer indicated to the boys that they were welcome to a bag of sugar he (<font color='blue'><b>Czech</b></font>)'d
been keeping in his (<font color='blue'><b>Czech</b></font>) storeroom. Young Sternberg found the sugar irresistible, lowering
his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) face to it and swallowing it by the handful. It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) cruelly ill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) discovered
what the Schindler group were finding in Nuremberg and Ravensburg--that liberty and
the day of plenty had to be approached gradually.
The main purpose of this expedition to town had been to get bread. Feigenbaum was
armed, as a member of the Brinnlitz commandos, with a pistol and a rifle, and when the
baker insisted there was no bread, one of the others said to him (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Threaten him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) with the
rifle.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The man, after all, was Sudetendeutsch and in theory an approver of all their
misery. Feigenbaum pointed the weapon at the baker and moved through the shop into
the residence beyond, looking for hidden flour. In the parlor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Feigenbaum</b></font>) found the baker's wife
and two daughters huddled in shock. They looked so frightened, indistinguishable from
any Cracow family during an Aktion, that a great shame overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Feigenbaum</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Feigenbaum</b></font>) nodded to
the women as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Feigenbaum</b></font>) were on a social visit, and left.
The same shame overtook Mila Pfefferberg
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) first visit to the village. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Pfefferberg</b></font>) entered
the square, a Czech partisan stopped two
Sudeten girls and made them take
off their shoes so that Mila, who had only
clogs, could select the pair that fitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>)
better. This sort of dominance made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) flush,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) sat on the pavement making her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) embarrassed
choice. The partisan gave the clogs to the
Sudeten girl and passed on. Mila then
turned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mila</b></font>) tracks, ran up behind the girl, and
gave the shoes back. The
Sudetendeutscherin, Mila remembers,
was not even gracious.
In the evenings, the Russians came to the camp looking for women. Pfefferberg had to
put a pistol to the head of a soldier who penetrated the women's quarters and grabbed
Mrs. Krumholz. -LRB-mrs. Krumholz would for years later chide Pfefferberg, pointing at him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
and accusing him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Whatever chance I had of running off with a younger man, that
scoundrel prevented it!'' (<font color='red'><b>girls</b></font>)</div>-RRB- Three girls were taken away--more or less voluntarily--to a
Russian party, and came back after three days and, they claimed, a good time.
The hold of Brinnlitz was a negative one, and within a week the prisoners began to move
out. Some whose families had been consumed went directly to the West, never wishing
to see Poland again. The Bejski boys, using their cloth and vodka to pay their way,
traveled to Italy and boarded a Zionist ship to Palestine. The Dresners walked across
Moravia and Bohemia and into Germany, where Janek was among the first ten students
to enroll in the Bavarian University of Erlangen when it opened later in the year. Manci
Rosner returned to Podg@orze, where Henry had agreed to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). Henry Rosner
himself, liberated from Dachau with Olek, was in a pissoir in Munich one day and saw
another client of the place wearing prison-camp stripes. He (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) asked the man where he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) had
been imprisoned. <div class="bookquote">``Brinnlitz,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man.
Everyone except an old lady, the man told
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) -LRB-inaccurately, as it turned out-RRB-, had
survived Brinnlitz. Manci herself would hear of
Henry's survival through a cousin who came to the
room in Podg@orze where Manci was waiting and
waved the Polish paper in which were listed the names of
Poles liberated from Dachau. <div class="bookquote">``Manci,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cousin</b></font>)</div>said
the cousin, <div class="bookquote">``give me a kiss. Henry's
alive, and so is Olek.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the cousin</b></font>)</div>Regina Horowitz had a similar
rendezvous. It took her (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) three weeks
to travel from Brinnlitz to Cracow with her (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) daughter Niusia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Horowitz</b></font>) rented a room--the
handout from the Navy store made that possible--and waited for Dolek. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Niusia</b></font>)
arrived, they sought to make inquiries of Richard, but there was no news. One day that
summer Regina saw the film of Auschwitz which the Russians had made and were
showing free of charge to the Polish population. She (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) saw the famous frames involving the
camp children, who looked out from behind the wire or were escorted by nuns past the
electrified fence of Auschwitz I. Being so small and so engaging, Richard figured in most
of the frames. Regina got up screaming and left the theater. The manager and a number of
passing citizens tried to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) in the street. <div class="bookquote">``It's my son, it's my son!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) kept
screaming. Now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) was alive, she (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) was able to discover that Richard had
been released by the Russians into the hands of one of the Jewish rescue organizations.
Thinking both his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) parents dead, the rescue body had had him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) adopted by some old
acquaintances of the Horowitzes', people named Liebling. Regina was given the address,
and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) arrived at the Lieblings' apartment could hear Richard inside, banging on a
saucepan and calling, <div class="bookquote">``Today there'll be soup for everyone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard/Richard Gl@ucks</b></font>)</div>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) knocked on the
door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) called to Mrs. Liebling to answer it.
So he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>). But after what he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had seen of the scaffolds of P@lasz@ow and
Auschwitz, she (<font color='blue'><b>Regina</b></font>) could never take him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) to a children's playground without his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) growing
hysterical at the sight of the swing frames.
At Linz, Oskar's group reported to the American authorities, were relieved of their
unreliable ambulance, and were taken by truck north to Nuremberg, to a large holding
center for wandering concentration-camp prisoners. They were discovering that, as they
had suspected, liberation wasn't a straightforward business.
Richard Rechen had an aunt in Constanz, by the lake on the Swiss border. When the
Americans asked the group if there was anywhere they could go, they nominated this
aunt. The intent of the eight young prisoners from Brinnlitz was to deliver the Schindlers,
if possible, across the Swiss border, in case vengeance against Germany erupted suddenly
and, even in the American zone, the Schindlers were unjustly punished. Additionally, all
eight of them were potential emigrants and believed that these matters would be easier to
arrange from Switzerland.
Reubinski remembers that their relationship with the
American commandant in Nuremberg was cordial,
but the man would not spare them any transport
to take them south to Constanz. They made the
journey through the Black Forest as best they could,
some of it on foot, some of it by train. Near
Ravensburg they went to the local prison camp
and spoke to the U.s. commandant. Here again they
stayed as guests for some days, resting and living high
on Army rations. In return, they sat up
late with the commandant, who was of Jewish descent,
and told him (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>) their stories of Amon and
P@lasz@ow, of Gr@oss-Rosen,
Auschwitz, Brinnlitz. They hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) would give them transport to Constanz, possibly a
truck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) could not spare a truck, but gave them a bus instead, together with some
provisions for the journey. Though Oskar still carried diamonds worth over 1,000 RM. as
well as some currency, the bus does not appear to have been bought but was instead
given freely. After his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) dealings with the German bureaucrats, it must have been difficult
for Oskar to adjust to that sort of transaction. West of Constanz, on the Swiss border and
in the French Occupied zone, they parked the bus in the village of Kreuzlingen. Rechen
went to the town hardware store and bought a pair of wire cutters. It seems that the party
were still wearing their prison uniforms when the wire cutters were purchased. Perhaps
the man behind the counter was influenced by one of two considerations: -LRB-a-RRB- this was a
prisoner, and if thwarted might call his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) French protectors; -LRB-b-RRB- this was in fact a German
officer escaping in disguise and perhaps should be helped.
The border fence ran through the middle of
Kreuzlingen and was guarded on the German side
by French sentries of the S@uret`e
Militaire. The group approached this barrier
on the edge of the village and, snipping the wires,
waited for the sentry to near the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) beat before
slipping through to Switzerland. Unhappily, a
woman from the village observed them from a bend of the
road and rushed to the border to alert the French and
Swiss. In a quiet Swiss village
square, a mirror image of the one on
the German side, the Swiss police surrounded the party, but Richard and Anka Rechen
broke away and had to be chased and apprehended by a patrol car. The party was, within
half an hour, passed back to the French, who at once searched their possessions,
discovering jewels and currency; drove them to the former German prison; and locked
them in separate cells.
It was clear to Reubinski that they were under suspicion of having been concentrationcamp
guards. In that sense the weight they had put on as guests of the Americans
boomeranged, for they did not look as deprived as when they'd first left Brinnlitz. They
were interrogated separately about their journey, about the valuables they were carrying.
Each of them could tell a plausible story, but did not know if the others were telling the
same one. They seem to have been afraid, in a way that had not applied with the
Americans, that if the French discovered Oskar's identity and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) function in Brinnlitz,
they would arraign him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) as a matter of course.
Prevaricating for Oskar's sake and Emilie's, they remained there a week. The Schindlers
themselves now knew enough about Judaism to pass the obvious cultural tests. But
Oskar's manner and physical condition didn't make his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) posture of recent-prisoner-of-theSs
very credible. Unhappily, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) Hebrew letter was over in Linz, in the files of the
Americans. Edek Reubinski, as the leader of the eight, was questioned most regularly,
and on the seventh day of his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) imprisonment was brought into the interrogation room to
find a second person there, a man in civilian clothes, a speaker of Polish, brought in to
test Reubinski's claim that he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) came from Cracow. For some reason--because the Pole
played a compassionate role in the questioning that followed, or because of the
familiarity of the language--Reubinski broke down, began to weep, and told the full
story in fluent Polish. The rest were called one by one, were shown Reubinski, were told
he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had confessed, and then were ordered to recite their version of the truth in Polish.
When at the end of the morning the versions matched, the whole group, the Schindlers
included, were gathered in the interrogation room and embraced by both interrogators.
The Frenchman, says Reubinski, was weeping. Everyone was delighted at that
phenomenon--a weeping interrogator. When he (<font color='blue'><b>interrogator</b></font>) managed to compose himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>interrogator</b></font>) called
for lunch to be brought in for himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>interrogator</b></font>) colleague, the Schindlers, the eight. That
afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>interrogator</b></font>) had them transferred to a lakeside hotel in Constanz, where they stayed for
some days at the expense of the French military government.
By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>interrogator</b></font>) sat down to dinner that evening at the hotel with Emilie, Reubinski, the
Rechens, and the others, Oskar's property had passed to the Soviets, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) last few
jewels and currency were lost in the interstices of the liberating bureaucracy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was as
good as penniless, but was eating as well as could be managed in a good hotel with a
number of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``family.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>All of which would be the pattern of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) future.
EPILOGUE
Oskar's high season ended now. The peace would
never exalt him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) as had the war. Oskar and
Emilie came to Munich. For a time they shared
lodgings with the Rosners, for Henry and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) brother
had been engaged to play at a Munich
restaurant and had achieved a modest
prosperity. One of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) former prisoners, meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) at the Rosners' small, cramped
apartment, was shocked by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) torn coat. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) property in Cracow and Moravia had, of
course, been confiscated by the Russians, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) remaining jewelry had been traded for
food and liquor. When the Feigenbaums arrived in Munich, they met his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) latest mistress,
a Jewish girl, a survivor not of Brinnlitz but of worse camps than that. Many of the
visitors to Oskar's rented rooms, as indulgent as they were toward Oskar's heroic
weaknesses, felt shamed for Emilie's sake.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was still a wildly generous friend and a great discoverer of unprocurables. Henry
Rosner remembers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) found a source of chickens in the midst of chickenless Munich.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) clung to the company of those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) Jews who had come to Germany-- the Rosners,
the Pfefferbergs, the Dresners, the Feigenbaums, the Sternbergs. Some cynics would later
say that at the time it was wise of anyone involved in concentration camps to stay close to
Jewish friends as protective coloration. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) dependence went beyond that sort of
instinctive cunning. The Schindlerjuden had become his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) family.
In common with them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosner</b></font>) heard that Amon Goeth had been captured by Patton's
Americans the previous February, while a patient in an SS sanitarium at Bad Tolz;
imprisoned in Dachau; and at the close of the war handed over to the new Polish
government. Amon was in fact one of the first Germans dispatched to Poland for
judgment. A number of former prisoners were invited to attend the trial as witnesses, and
among the defense witnesses a deluded Amon considered calling were Helen Hirsch and
Oskar Schindler. Oskar himself did not go to Cracow for the trials. Those who did found
that Goeth, lean as a result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) diabetes, offered a subdued but unrepentant defense. All
the orders for his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) acts of execution and transportation had been signed by superiors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
claimed, and were therefore their crimes, not his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). Witnesses who told of murders
committed by the Commandant's own hand were, said Amon, maliciously exaggerating.
There had been some prisoners executed as saboteurs, but there were always saboteurs in
wartime.
Mietek Pemper, waiting in the body of the
court to be called to give evidence, sat beside
another P@lasz@ow graduate who stared at
Amon in the dock and whispered, <div class="bookquote">``That man still
terrifies me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amon/Amon Goeth/Goeth</b></font>)</div>But Pemper himself, as first
witness for the prosecution, delivered an exact
catalogue of Amon's crimes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) was
followed by others, among them Dr. Biberstein and
Helen Hirsch, who had precise and painful
memories. Amon was condemned to death and hanged
in Cracow on September 13, 1946. It was
two years to the day since his (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) arrest by the SS in
Vienna on black-marketeering charges. According to the
Cracow press, he (<font color='blue'><b>Amon</b></font>) went to the gallows without
remorse and gave the National Socialist
salute before dying.
In Munich, Oskar himself identified
Liepold, who had been detained by the
Americans. A Brinnlitz prisoner
accompanied Oskar at the lineup, and says that Oskar asked the protesting Liepold, <div class="bookquote">``Do
you want me to do it, or would you rather leave it to the fifty angry Jews who are waiting
downstairs in the street?''  (<font color='red'><b>Liepold/Josef Liepold</b></font>)</div>Liepold would also be hanged--not for his (<font color='blue'><b>Liepold</b></font>) crimes in Brinnlitz,
but for earlier murders in Budzyn.
Oskar had probably already conceived the scheme of becoming a farmer in Argentina; a
breeder of nutria, the large South American aquatic rodents considered precious for their
skins. Oskar presumed that the same excellent commercial instincts which had brought
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to Cracow in 1939 were now urging him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to cross the Atlantic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was penniless, but
the Joint Distribution Committee, the international Jewish relief organization to whom
Oskar had made reports during the war and to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) record was known, were willing
to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). In 1949 they made him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) an ex gratia payment of $15,000 and gave a
reference -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``To Whom It May Concern'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-RRB- signed by M. W. Beckelman, the vice chairman
of the <div class="bookquote">``Joint's''  (<font color='red'><b>the vice chairman</b></font>)</div>Executive Council. It said:
The American Joint Distribution
Committee has thoroughly investigated the wartime and Occupation activities of Mr.
Schindler. ... We recommend wholeheartedly that all organizations and individuals
contacted by Mr. Schindler do their utmost to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>), in recognition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) outstanding
service. ... Under the guise of operating a Nazi labor factory first in Poland and then in
the Sudetenland, Mr. Schindler managed to take in as employees and protect Jewish men
and women destined for death in Auschwitz or other infamous concentration camps. ...
<div class="bookquote">``Schindler's camp in Brinnlitz,''  (<font color='red'><b>witnesses</b></font>)</div>witnesses have told the Joint Distribution Committee,
<div class="bookquote">``was the only camp in the Nazi-occupied territories where a Jew was never killed, or
even beaten, but was always treated as a human being.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joint Distribution Committee</b></font>)</div>Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) is about to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) life anew, let us help him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) as once he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) helped our
brethren.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) sailed for Argentina, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) took with him (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) half a dozen families of Schindlerjuden,
paying the passage for many of them. With Emilie, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) settled on a farm in Buenos Aires
province and worked it for nearly ten years. Those of Oskar's survivors who did not see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) in those years find it hard now to imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) as a farmer, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was never a man
for steady routine. Some say, and there is some truth to it, that Emalia and Brinnlitz
succeeded in their eccentric way because of the acumen of men like Stern and Bankier. In
Argentina, Oskar had no such support, apart, of course, from the good sense and rural
industriousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wife. The decade in which Oskar farmed nutria, however, was the
period in which it was demonstrated that breeding, as distinct from trapping, did not
produce pelts of adequate quality. Many other nutria enterprises failed in that time, and in
1957 the Schindlers' farm went bankrupt. Emilie and Oskar moved into a house
provided by B'nai B'rith in San Vicente, a southern suburb of Buenos Aires, and for a
time Oskar sought work as a sales representative. Within a year, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) left for
Germany. Emilie remained behind.
Living in a small apartment in Frankfurt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) sought capital to buy a cement factory, and
pursued the possibility of major compensation from the West German Ministry of
Finance for the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) Polish and Czechoslovakian properties.
Little came of this effort. Some of Oskar's
survivors considered that the failure of the German
government to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) due arose from lingering
Hitlerism in the middle ranks of the civil
service. But Oskar's claim probably
failed for technical reasons, and it is not
possible to detect bureaucratic malice in the correspondence addressed to Oskar from the
ministry.
The Schindler cement enterprise was launched on capital from the Joint Distribution
Committee and <div class="bookquote">``loans''  (<font color='red'><b>Joint Distribution Committee</b></font>)</div>from a number of Schindler Jews who had done well in postwar
Germany. It had a brief history. By 1961, Oskar was bankrupt again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) factory had
been hurt by a series of harsh winters in which the construction industry had closed
down; but some of the Schindler survivors believe the company's failure was abetted by
Oskar's restlessness and low tolerance for routine.
That year, hearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was in trouble, the Schindlerjuden in Israel invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) to visit
them at their expense. An advertisement appeared in Israel's Polish-language press
asking that all former inmates of Concentration Camp Brinnlitz who had known <div class="bookquote">``Oskar
Schindler the German''  (<font color='red'><b>all inmates</b></font>)</div>contact the newspaper. In Tel Aviv, Oskar was welcomed
ecstatically. The postwar children of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) survivors mobbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had grown heavier
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) features had thickened. But at the parties and receptions, those who had known
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was the same indomitable Oskar. The growling deft wit, the outrageous
Charles Boyer charm, the voracious thirst had all survived his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) two bankruptcies.
It was the year of the Adolf Eichmann trial, and Oskar's visit to Israel aroused some
interest in the international press. On the eve of the opening of Eichmann's trial, the
correspondent of the London Daily Mail wrote a feature on the contrast between the
records of the two men, and quoted the preamble of an appeal the Schindlerjuden had
opened to assist Oskar. <div class="bookquote">``We do not forget the sorrows of Egypt, we do not forget
Haman, we do not forget Hitler. Thus, among the unjust, we do not forget the just.
Remember Oskar Schindler.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Holocaust survivors</b></font>)</div>There was some incredulity among Holocaust survivors about the idea of a beneficent
labor camp such as Oskar's, and this disbelief found its voice through a journalist at a
press conference with Schindler in Jerusalem. <div class="bookquote">``How do you explain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``that you
knew all the senior SS men in the Cracow region and had regular dealings with them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``At that stage in history,''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>Oskar answered, <div class="bookquote">``it was rather difficult to discuss the fate of
Jews with the Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem.''  (<font color='red'><b>Oskar/Schindler/Herr Schindler</b></font>)</div>The Department of Testimonies of the Yad
Vashem had, near the end of Oskar's Argentine residence, sought and been given by him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
a general statement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) activities in Cracow and Brinnlitz. Now, on their own initiative
and under the influence of Itzhak Stern, Jakob Sternberg, and Moshe Bejski -LRB-once
Oskar's forger of official stamps, now a respected and scholarly lawyer-RRB-, the Board of
Trustees of Yad Vashem began to consider the question of an official tribute to Oskar.
The chairman of the board was Justice Landau, the presiding judge at the Eichmann trial.
Yad Vashem sought and received a mass of testimonies concerning Oskar. Of this large
collection of statements, four are critical of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). Though these four witnesses all state
that without Oskar they would have perished, they criticize his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) business methods in the
early months of the war. Two of the four disparaging testimonies are written by a father
and son, called earlier in this account the C's. In their enamelware outlet in Cracow,
Oskar had installed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) mistress Ingrid as Treuh@ander. A third statement is by the C's'
secretary and repeats the allegations of punching and bullying, rumors of which Stern had
reported back to Oskar in 1940. The fourth comes from a man who claims to have had a
prewar interest in Oskar's enamel factory under its former name, Rekord--an interest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
claimed, that Oskar had ignored.
Justice Landau and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) board must have considered these four statements insignificant
when set against the massed testimony of other Schindlerjuden, and they made no
comment on them. Since all four stated that Oskar was their savior in any case, it is said
to have occurred to the board to ask why, if Oskar had committed crimes against these
people, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) went to such extravagant pains to save them.
The municipality of Tel Aviv was the first
body to honor Oskar. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) fifty-third
birthday he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) unveiled a plaque in the Park of
Heroes. The inscription describes him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) as
savior of 1,200 prisoners of AL
Brinnlitz, and though it understates numerically the
extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) rescue, it declares that it has been
erected in love and gratitude. Ten days
later in Jerusalem, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was declared a Righteous
Person, this title being a peculiarly
Israeli honor based on an ancient
tribal assumption that in the mass of Gentiles, the God of Israel would always provide a
leavening of just men. Oskar was invited also to plant a carob tree in the Avenue of the
Righteous leading to the Yad Vashem Museum. The tree is still there, marked by a
plaque, in a grove which contains trees planted in the name of all the other Righteous. A
tree for Julius Madritsch, who had illicitly fed and protected his (<font color='blue'><b>Madritsch</b></font>) workers in a manner
quite unheard of among the Krupps and the Farbens, stands there also, and a tree for
Raimund Titsch, the Madritsch supervisor in P@lasz@ow. On that stony ridge, few of
the memorial trees have grown to more than 10 feet.
The German press carried stories of
Oskar's wartime rescues and of the Yad
Vashem ceremonies. These reports, always laudatory, did not make his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) life easier.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was hissed on the streets of Frankfurt, stones were thrown, a group of workmen jeered
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) and called out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) ought to have been burned with the Jews. In 1963 he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) punched
a factory worker who'd called him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) a <div class="bookquote">``Jew-kisser,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and the man lodged a charge of
assault. In the local court, the lowest level of the German judiciary, Oskar received a
lecture from the judge and was ordered to pay damages. <div class="bookquote">``I would kill myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wrote
to Henry Rosner in Queens, New York, <div class="bookquote">``if it wouldn't give them so much satisfaction.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Rosner/Henry Rosner</b></font>)</div>These humiliations increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) dependence on the
survivors. They were his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) only emotional and
financial surety. For the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
would spend some months of every year with them, living
honored and well in Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem, eating free of charge at a
Rumanian restaurant in Ben Yehudah
Street, Tel Aviv, though subject sometimes
to Moshe Bejski's filial efforts to limit his (<font color='blue'><b>Bejski</b></font>)
drinking to three double cognacs a night. In the
end, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bejski</b></font>) would always return to the other half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bejski</b></font>)
soul: the disinherited self; the mean, cramped
apartment a few hundred meters from
Frankfurt's central railway station.
Writing from Los Angeles to other
Schindlerjuden in the United States that
year, Poldek Pfefferberg urged all
survivors to donate at least a day's pay a
year to Oskar Schindler, whose state he (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>)
described as <div class="bookquote">``discouragement, loneliness, disillusion.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Oskar's contacts with the Schindlerjuden
continued on a yearly basis. It was a seasonal
matter--half the year as the Israeli
butterfly, half the year as the Frankfurt
grub. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schindler</b></font>) was continually short of money. A Tel Aviv committee of which Itzhak Stern,
Jakob Sternberg, and Moshe Bejski were again members continued to lobby the West
German government for an adequate pension for Oskar. The grounds for their appeal
were his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wartime heroism, the property he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had lost, and the by-now-fragile state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
health. The first official reaction from the German government was, however, the award
of the Cross of Merit in 1966, in a ceremony at which Konrad Adenauer presided. It was
not till July 1, 1968, that the Ministry of Finance was happy to report that from that date
it would pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Konrad</b></font>) a pension of 200 marks per month. Three months later, pensioner
Schindler received the Papal Knighthood of St. Sylvester from the hands of the Bishop of
Limburg.
Oskar was still willing to cooperate with the Federal Justice Department in the pursuit of
war criminals. In this matter he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) seems to have been implacable. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) birthday in 1967,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) gave confidential information concerning many of the personnel of KL P@lasz@ow.
The transcript of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) evidence of that date shows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) does not hesitate to testify, but
also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) is a scrupulous witness. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) knows nothing or little of a particular SS man,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) says so.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) says it of Amthor; of the SS man
Zugsburger; of Fraulein Ohnesorge, one
of the quick-tempered women supervisors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) does not hesitate, however, to call Bosch a
murderer and an exploiter, and says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) recognized Bosch at a railway station in
Munich in 1946, approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>), and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) if--after P@lasz@ow--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) could
manage to sleep.
Bosch, says Oskar, was at that point living under
an East German passport. A supervisor
named Mohwinkel, representative in
P@lasz@ow of the German Armaments Works, is also roundly condemned; <div class="bookquote">``intelligent
but brutal,''  (<font color='red'><b>representative</b></font>)</div>Oskar says of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>). Of Goeth's bodyguard, Gr@un, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) tells the story of the
attempted execution of the Emalia prisoner Lamus, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) himself prevented by a gift
of vodka. -LRB-it is a story to which a great number of prisoners also testify in their statements
in Yad Vashem.-RRB- Of the NCO Ritschek, Oskar says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) has a bad reputation but that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) himself knows nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) crimes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) is also uncertain whether the photograph the
Justice Department showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Department</b></font>) is in fact Ritschek. There is only one person on the
Justice Department list for whom Oskar is willing to give an unqualified commendation.
That is the engineer Huth, who had helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Huth</b></font>) during his (<font color='blue'><b>Huth</b></font>) last arrest. Huth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Huth</b></font>) says, was
highly respected and highly spoken of by the prisoners themselves.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Huth</b></font>) entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Huth</b></font>) sixties, he (<font color='blue'><b>Huth</b></font>) began working for the German Friends of Hebrew
University. This involvement resulted from the urgings of those Schindlerjuden who were
concerned with restoring some new purpose to Oskar's life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) began to work raising
funds in West Germany. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) old capacity to inveigle and charm officials and
businessmen was exercised once again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) also helped set up a scheme of exchanges
between German and Israeli children.
Despite the precariousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) health, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) still lived and drank like a young man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
was in love with a German woman named Annemarie, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had met at the King
David Hotel in Jerusalem. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would become the emotional linchpin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) later life.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) wife, Emilie, still lived, without any
financial help from him (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) little house in
San Vicente, south of Buenos Aires. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>)
lives there at the time of the writing of this book. As
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) was in Brinnlitz, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) is a figure of
quiet dignity. In a documentary made
by German television in 1973, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) spoke-- without any of the abandoned wife's
bitterness or sense of grievance--about Oskar and Brinnlitz, about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) own behavior in
Brinnlitz.
Perceptively, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emilie</b></font>) remarked that Oskar had done nothing astounding before the war and
had been unexceptional since. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was fortunate, therefore, that in that short fierce era
between 1939 and 1945 he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had met people who summoned forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) deeper talents.
In 1972, during a visit by Oskar to the
New York executive office of the American
Friends of Hebrew University, three
Schindlerjuden, partners in a large New
Jersey construction company, led a group of
seventy-five other Schindler prisoners in
raising $120,000 to dedicate to Oskar a
floor of the Truman Research Center at
Hebrew University. The floor would house a Book of Life, containing an account of
Oskar's rescues and a list of the rescued. Two of these partners, Murray Pantirer and Isak
Levenstein, had been sixteen years old when Oskar brought them to Brinnlitz. Now
Oskar's children had become his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) parents, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) best recourse, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) source of honor.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) was very ill. The men who had been
physicians in Brinnlitz--Alexander
Biberstein, for example--knew it. One of them
warned Oskar's close friends, <div class="bookquote">``The man should not be
alive. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart is working through pure
stubbornness.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Oskar friends</b></font>)</div>In October 1974, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) collapsed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>)
small apartment near the railway station in Frankfurt and died in a hospital on October 9.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) death certificate says that advanced hardening of the arteries of the brain and heart
had caused the final seizure. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) will declared a wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) had already expressed to a
number of Schindlerjuden--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oskar</b></font>) be buried in Jerusalem. Within two weeks the
Franciscan parish priest of Jerusalem had given his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) permission for Herr Oskar Schindler,
one of the Church's least observant sons, to be buried in the Latin Cemetery of
Jerusalem.
Another month passed before Oskar's body was
carried in a leaden casket through the crammed
streets of the Old City of Jerusalem to the
Catholic cemetery, which looks south over the
Valley of Hinnom, called Gehenna in the
New Testament. In the press photograph of the
procession can be seen--amid a stream of other
Schindler Jews--Itzhak Stern, Moshe
Bejski, Helen Hirsch, Jakob Sternberg,
Juda Dresner.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dresner</b></font>) was mourned on every continent.
