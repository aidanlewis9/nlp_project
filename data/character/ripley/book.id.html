<p/>A Journey for Tom Ripley.

<p/>Tom looked behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and saw the man coming out of the Green Cage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cage</b></font>) walked faster. There was no doubt the man was following him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Tom had noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) five minutes ago, staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) from a table. Tom had paid for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) drink in a hurry and left.

<p/>At the corner, Tom leaned forward and ran across Fifth Avenue. There was Raoul's. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Raoul</b></font>) take a chance and go in for another drink? Or should he (<font color='blue'><b>Raoul</b></font>) run over to Park Avenue and try to escape by hiding in dark doorways? He (<font color='blue'><b>Raoul</b></font>) went into Raoul's.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Raoul</b></font>) walked up to an empty seat at the bar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raoul</b></font>) looked around to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raoul</b></font>) knew anyone. There was that big man with red hair, whose name he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always forgot, sitting at a table with a blonde girl. But who was that man outside? Was that the kind of man they would send after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't look like a police officer or a detective. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked like a businessman, someone's father, well-dressed with gray hair. Was that the kind of man they sent on a job like this? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would chat with you in a bar, and then bang! - one hand on the shoulder and the other hand holding a policeman's identification. Tom Ripley, you're under arrest! Tom watched the door.

<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was, coming inside, taking a place at the bar. Tom stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). They couldn't give you more than ten years, Tom thought. Maybe fifteen, but with good behavior - As the man started to speak, Tom suffered a moment of desperate regret. Why was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pretending to work for the income tax office? Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) received checks for hundreds of dollars from stupid people who believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said they owed money. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) never cashed the checks. It was really just a silly game that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feel powerful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me, are you Tom Ripley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is Herbert Greenleaf. Richard Greenleaf's father.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face would have been less confusing if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been holding a gun. The face was friendly, smiling, and hopeful. <div class="bookquote">``You're a friend of Richard's, aren't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom searched his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) memory. Dickie Greenleaf. A tall, blond guy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had quite a lot of money, Tom remembered. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Dickie Greenleaf, yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles and Marta Schriever told me about you. I know so few of Richard's friends, but they seemed to think you know him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) quite well. Somebody told them you drank at the Green Cage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Cage</b></font>), yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you're not writing him (<font color='blue'><b>Cage</b></font>) now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf seemed disappointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't think I've seen Dickie in a couple of years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s been in Europe for two years. The Schrievers thought you might have some influence on Richard. We want him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) to come home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom hadn't seen the Schrievers more than three or four times in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had once calculated Charley Schrievers income tax and saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a lot of money. Maybe that was why the Schrievers had recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). Maybe Charley had said that Tom was intelligent, honest, and very willing to help. It was a slight mistake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose you know anybody else close to Richard who might be able to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd certainly like to help. Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) staying in Europe?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom asked, not caring at all where Dickie was staying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a town called Mongibello, south of Naples. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) divides his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) time between painting and sailing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) bought a house. Richard has his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) own income - not a large amount, but enough to live on in Italy it seems.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom thought Dickie was probably having a great time over there. An income, a house, a boat. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) want to come home? Dickie was lucky. What was Tom doing? Living from week to week. Hiding from the police now for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had a talent for mathematics. Why didn't someone pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) for it? Tom realized that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) whole body had tensed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was bored, bored, bored! He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wanted to be at the bar by himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd be very happy to write to Dickie if you give me his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) address. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'ll remember me. We were at a weekend party out on Long Island once, I remember. And I came up to your apartment a few times, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom went on. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) showed me some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) models - of ships.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) ever show you his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) drawings?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf was smiling again.

<p/>Dickie hadn't, but Tom said brightly, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) did. Interesting, some of them.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom had never seen them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could imagine them now - and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could see Dickie holding them up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) to see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Richard has talent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf said with satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) has,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom agreed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was getting more bored every minute. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew the feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) experienced them at parties or when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was having dinner with somebody he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't want to be with. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry I'm not free now or I'd go over and try to persuade Richard myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said, just because Mr. Greenleaf wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Richard has always listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) friends' advice. If you or somebody else could find the time, I'd even send them over to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). I don't suppose you could get time off from your present job, could you? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom's heart suddenly jumped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) put a look of careful thought on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't have a job. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might have to leave town soon anyway if the police started asking questions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wanted to leave New York. <div class="bookquote">``I might,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said carefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd be glad to pay for your trip. Do you really think you might be able to go - this fall?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I might. I'd be glad to see Richard again - especially if you think I might be able to help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do! I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)'d listen to you. You'll probably succeed where the rest of us have failed. Why don't you come over to my house and meet my wife? We'd be so happy if you would go to Europe and bring Richard back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>***

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, Tom, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf said in a voice that promised good drinks, an excellent dinner, and a bed for the night in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) got too tired to go home. <div class="bookquote">``Emily, this is Tom Ripley!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so happy to meet you!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) wife said warmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Mrs. Greenleaf?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Ripley's been here before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>)'s come here with Richard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)? I don't believe I met you, though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>About thirty minutes later, they went into the dining-room, where a table was set for three with a dark blue tablecloth and a whole cold chicken.

<p/>The conversation was dull and the dinner delicious. Tom told Mrs. Greenleaf that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was working for an advertising company called Rothenberg, Fleming, and Barter. Later, on purpose, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) called it Reddington, Fleming, and Parker. The Greenleafs didn't notice the difference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you go to college?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I went to Princeton for a time, then when I visited an aunt in Denver I stayed out there and went to college.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom hoped Mr. Greenleaf would ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) something about Princeton, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) didn't. Tom could discuss the teaching system, the college rules, the atmosphere at weekend dances, and the political beliefs of the students. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been very friendly with a Princeton student last summer and had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) for more and more information in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might be able to use it some time. Tom had also met a young man who had been going to the University of Colorado. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had told the Greenleafs that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been raised by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Aunt Dottie in Boston. In truth, though, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dottie</b></font>) had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to Denver when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was sixteen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had only finished high school there, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt like he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had gone to school there as well. After Tom had finished high school, they had moved back to Boston again.

<p/>Mrs. Greenleaf came in with some photographs and Tom sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) looked through them. Richard taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) first step; Richard with long, blond curls. The photographs weren't interesting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) until Richard was about sixteen. Richard had hardly changed between sixteen and twenty-four.

<p/>Mrs. Greenleaf handed Tom several photos. <div class="bookquote">``These are from Europe. This is Mongibello,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) said, showing Tom a picture of Dickie in a boat on the sand. <div class="bookquote">``And here's the girl, the only other American who lives there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marge Sherwood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf said. The girl was in a swimsuit on the beach, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms around her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knees. There was also a good picture of Richard in shorts, sitting on the wall of a terrace.

<p/>Tom noticed that Mrs. Greenleaf was staring down at the floor in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) eyes. Mr. Greenleaf had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) that Mrs. Greenleaf was seriously ill and got emotional very easily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) was worried she (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) would never see Dickie again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) husband came over to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Greenleaf,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said softly, <div class="bookquote">``I want you to know that I'll do everything I can to make Dickie come home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Tom.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) pressed Tom's hand tightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Emily, don't you think it's time for you to go to bed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf asked.

<p/>Tom stood up as Mrs. Greenleaf did. Mr. Greenleaf went out of the room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>).

<p/>Tom remained standing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sides. In a large mirror on the wall he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could see himself: the serious, hard-working young man again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was doing the right thing, behaving the right way, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had a feeling of guilt.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt himself beginning to sweat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tried to relax. What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) so worried about? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d felt so good tonight. It's like a dream, Tom thought. In a minute, Mr. Greenleaf or somebody else would say, <div class="bookquote">``Tom, Tom!''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) would open his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) eyes and find himself back in Raoul's with a drink in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>).



<p/>Chapter two

<p/>A New Start.

<p/>Tom's mood was calm and happy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't feel like making friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) time for thinking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) began to play a role on the ship, the role of a serious young man with an important job ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a sudden desire for a hat and so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bought one on the ship, a blue-gray cap of soft English wool. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could look like so many different types of people in the hat. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had always thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the world's dullest face. The cap changed all that. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a young man with a private income, not long out of Princeton, possibly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was starting a new life. Goodbye to all of the awful people he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had known in New York. Whatever happened with Dickie, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) would handle himself well and Mr. Greenleaf would respect him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) for it. When Mr. Greenleaf's money was gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) might not come back to America. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) might get an interesting job in a hotel. Or he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) might work as a salesperson for a European company and travel around in the world.

<p/>One afternoon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) wrote a polite letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) Aunt Dottie.



<p/>Dear Auntie,

<p/>I am on my way to Europe by boat. I had a business offer that I can't explain right now. I had to leave suddenly, so I was not able to come to Boston and I'm sorry because it may be months or even years before I come back.

<p/>I wanted to tell you not to worry and not to send me any more checks. Thank you very much for the last one from a month ago. I am well and very happy.

<p/>Love, Tom



<p/>The letter made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feel better because it separated him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). No more of the letters comparing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father and the stupid checks for six dollars and forty-eight cents or twelve dollars and ninety-five cents when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had some change left over from the store. Aunt Dottie had always told Tom that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Dottie</b></font>) more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father had left in insurance. But did she (<font color='blue'><b>Dottie</b></font>) have to keep repeating it? Lots of aunts and even strangers raised a child for nothing and were glad to do it.

<p/>After his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) letter to Aunt Dottie, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got up and walked around the ship. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) always got angry when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dottie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hated being nice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dottie</b></font>). Until now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had always needed the money she (<font color='blue'><b>Dottie</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't need it now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would be independent forever.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had run away from Aunt Dottie at seventeen and had been brought back, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had done it again at twenty and succeeded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) remembered how innocent he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been, not knowing how the world worked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been fired from a job in New York because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wasn't strong enough to lift boxes eight hours a day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was very upset and thought it wasn't fair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) remembered deciding then that the world was full of selfish people and that you had to be an animal or you wouldn't eat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) remembered right after that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had stolen a loaf of bread from a store and had taken it home and eaten it quickly, feeling that the world owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bread, and more.

<p/>Tom sat back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) chair again, pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hat down over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes, and folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stomach. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) separation from the other passengers was making them notice him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) imagined the others asking, <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) an American? I think so, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) doesn't act like an American, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)? Most Americans are so noisy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s very serious, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) can't be more than twenty-three. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) must have something very important on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had. The present and future of Tom Ripley.

<p/>***

<p/>A few days later, Tom arrived in Naples, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stayed overnight. The next morning at eleven, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got on the bus for Mongibello. Now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw little villages by the water's edge and people swimming near the shore. Finally, the driver said loudly, <div class="bookquote">``Mongibello.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom jumped down out of the bus and walked into the little post office across the road, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) asked the man behind the window for Richard Greenleaf's house.

<p/>After a short walk, Tom found a two-floor house with an iron gate on the road and a terrace that hung over the cliff's edge. Tom rang the bell. An Italian woman came out of the house drying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Greenleaf?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom asked.

<p/>The woman smiled and answered in Italian as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pointed down toward the sea.

<p/>Tom nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't have a swimsuit so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went into one of the little shops near the post office and bought a tiny black and yellow one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoes again and walked down a road which led to the beach.

<p/>Looking down the beach, Tom saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) from a great distance - definitely Dickie, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) skin was a dark brown and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hair looked lighter than Tom remembered it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was with Marge. Tom approached the pair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dickie Greenleaf?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) asked, smiling.

<p/>Dickie looked up. <div class="bookquote">``Yes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm Tom Ripley. I met you in the States several years ago. Remember? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickie didn't seem to recognize Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think your father said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was going to write you about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stood up. <div class="bookquote">``Tom what is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ripley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Marge Sherwood,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Marge, Tom Ripley.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) carefully, not in a very friendly manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't seem to remember me from New York,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't really say that I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie said, <div class="bookquote">``Where did I meet you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think - Wasn't it at Buddy Lankenau's?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It wasn't, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew Dickie knew Buddy Lankenau, and Buddy was a very nice guy.

<p/>After a short swim, Dickie and Marge returned to their towels. Dickie said, <div class="bookquote">``We're leaving. Would you like to come up to the house and have lunch with us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes. Thanks very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Fifteen minutes later, Tom had had a cool shower and was sitting in a comfortable chair on Dickie's terrace with a drink in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wondered if Marge lived here.

<p/>At that moment, Dickie came out and poured himself a drink. <div class="bookquote">``Sorry there's no ice. I haven't got a refrigerator.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I have a shirt for you. Your mother said you'd asked for one. Also some socks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know my mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I met your father just before I left New York, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked me to dinner at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) offered you a job, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s always searching for young men to work for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) didn't.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom felt that Dickie didn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>). Had Mr. Greenleaf told Dickie he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was coming to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) to return home? Or was Dickie just in a bad mood? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) probably could have persuaded Dickie to come home if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had met Dickie in a cafe down at the beach, but this way was useless. Tom was angry at himself. Nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took so seriously ever worked out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had learned that years ago.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What hotel are you staying in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>Marge asked Tom.

<p/>Tom smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't found one yet. What do you recommend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Miramare's the best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case, I'll try the Miramare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said, standing up. <div class="bookquote">``I must go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div><p/>Neither Dickie nor Marge asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) to stay. Dickie walked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) to the gate. Marge wasn't leaving. Tom wondered if Dickie and Marge were sleeping together. Marge was in love with Dickie, Tom thought, but Dickie didn't care much about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was nice to meet you. Goodbye, Dickie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodbye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>***

<p/>Tom let three days go by. On the fourth morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went down to the beach and found Dickie alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't look like Marge is coming down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie said. <div class="bookquote">``I think I'll go up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom got up. They walked to the Miramare, saying almost nothing to each other. They went up to Tom's room, and Dickie tried the shirt on and held the socks up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) feet. Both the shirt and the socks were the right size and, as Tom had thought, Dickie was very pleased with the shirt.

<p/>Now Dickie had everything, Tom thought, everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had to offer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) would refuse an invitation for a drink, too, Tom knew. <div class="bookquote">``Thanks for delivering the clothes. It was very nice of you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I ought to tell you something else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``Your father sent me over here especially to ask you to come home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie asked. <div class="bookquote">``Paid your way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) last chance to make Dickie laugh or go out and slam the door in disgust. But the smile was coming the way Tom remembered Dickie's smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paid your way! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s getting desperate, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie closed the door again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came up to me in a bar in New York,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said. <div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) I wasn't a close friend of yours, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thought I could help if I came over. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) I'd try. I don't want you to think I'm taking advantage of your father. I'll try to find a job somewhere in Europe soon, and I'll be able to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) back. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bought me a round-trip ticket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't bother! The company will pay for it. I can just see Dad approaching you in a bar. Which bar was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Raonl's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) followed me from the Green Cage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom and Dickie had a drink in the hotel bar. They drank to Herbert Richard Greenleaf.



<p/>Chapter three

<p/>Friendships and Jealousies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, Tom, I'll show you some of my paintings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickie led the way into the big room Tom had looked into a couple of times on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) way to and from the shower.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is one of Marge I'm working on now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said with interest. It wasn't good in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) opinion, probably in anybody's opinion.

<p/>``And these - a lot of paintings of the seashore. ``Dickie obviously wanted Tom to say something nice about them, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was proud of them. They were all wild and all the same.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long are you going to be here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, at least a week, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because - ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie's face was red from the wine which had put him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in a good mood. <div class="bookquote">``If you're going to be here a little longer, why don't you stay with me? There's no reason to stay in a hotel, unless you prefer it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a bed in the other room, which you didn't see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>***

<p/>The next morning, Tom moved in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are we still going to Naples?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom asked. <div class="bookquote">``Remember? We talked about it yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``It's only a quarter to twelve. We can make the twelve o'clock bus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The bus was just arriving as they reached the post office. Dickie stopped running, right in the face of a young man with red hair and a bright sports shirt, an American.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dickie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Freddie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie yelled. <div class="bookquote">``What are you doing here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Came to see you! And the Cecchis. They're giving me a place to stay for a few days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm off to Naples with a friend. Tom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie introduced them.

<p/>The American's name was Freddie Miles. Tom thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was disgusting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hated red hair. Freddie had large red-brown eyes that shook in his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) was also very heavy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See you tonight, Freddie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>About an hour later, the bus left Tom and Dickie in Naples.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know a good place for lunch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie said. <div class="bookquote">``A real Neapolitan pizza place. Do you like pizza?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They sat there until five o'clock. Dickie had spent most of the time talking about Freddie, and Tom had found the conversation as uninteresting as Freddie's face. Then they moved to a cafe called the Galleria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is what I like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie said. <div class="bookquote">``Sitting at a table and watching the people go by. It really improves your attitude toward life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div><p/>A well-dressed Italian greeted Dickie warmly and sat down at the table with them. Tom listened to their conversation in Italian, understanding a word here and there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Want to go to Rome?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said. <div class="bookquote">``Now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The Italian had a long, gray car with a loud radio that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and Dickie seemed happy to shout over. They reached Rome in about two hours and the Italian dropped them in the middle of a street and said a quick goodbye.

<p/>In Rome, they bought tickets for a music show that evening. After the show, they had dinner and drank a bottle and a half of wine. They were in a fine mood by one in the morning. They walked with their arms around each other's shoulders, singing and talking. Neither had the slightest idea what street they were on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When the sun comes up, we can see where we are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie said cheerfully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``Only a couple more hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The next morning, they returned to Naples, just in time to catch the bus for Mongibello.

<p/>When they reached Mongibello, Marge was annoyed because Dickie hadn't called to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was spending the night in Rome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind, of course, but I thought you were in Naples, and anything can happen in Naples.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mouth shut. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wasn't going to tell Marge anything they had done. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) imagine what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) pleased. Dickie had made it clear that they had had a very good time. Marge had the look of a mother or an older sister now - the woman's dislike of the rough play of little boys and men. Or was it jealousy? She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) seemed to know that Dickie had formed a closer friendship with Tom in twenty-four hours, just because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was another man, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) could ever have with Dickie, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) or not, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) didn't.

<p/>***

<p/>For the next three or four days, they didn't see much of Marge. Tom, anyway, kept Dickie amused. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had lots of funny stories to tell about New York, some of them true, some of them invented. Obviously, Dickie was enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) company.

<p/>Tom wrote to Mr. Greenleaf, promising him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) that Dickie was considering returning to the United States. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had to smile as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wrote the letter, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) and Dickie were talking of visiting the Greek islands this winter. Marge wouldn't be going,Tom was sure. Both he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and Dickie left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) out of their travel plans when they discussed them.

<p/>Dickie was paying attention to Marge because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>)'d be lonely in Mongibello by herself. But one day when they asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) to go to the Roman ruins at Herculaneum, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) refused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I'll stay home. You boys enjoy yourselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) said with an effort at a cheerful smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) won't, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said, and then walked calmly into the house so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) and Dickie could talk alone on the terrace if they wanted to.

<p/>After a few minutes, the gate slammed. Marge had left. Tom walked out of the house and onto the terrace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) angry about something?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) feels kind of ignored, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel like I'm getting in the way of your relationship with Marge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not! Getting in the way of what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) might think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. it's just that I owe her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) something. And I haven't been particularly nice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) lately. We haven't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's after two. Want to take a little walk and go by the post office?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked down the hill in silence. What had Marge said about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), Tom wondered. Dickie came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) silence only to greet Luigi, the post office worker, and thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) letter. Tom had no mail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I'll go up to see Marge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie said. <div class="bookquote">``I won't be long, but don't wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said, feeling suddenly desperate. About half way up the hill he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had the sudden need to go to Marge's house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could go with the excuse of apologizing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>), but satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) anger by surprising and annoying them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) suddenly felt that Dickie was touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>), at this minute, and partly he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wanted to see it, and partly he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) hated the idea of seeing it.

<p/>Tom stopped near Marge's apartment. One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) bras was hanging out of the window. Through the window, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could see that Dickie's arm was around her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) waist. Dickie was kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>), little kisses on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) cheek, smiling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>). Tom was disgusted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew Dickie didn't mean it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) knew Dickie was using this cheap, easy way to hold on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) friendship.

<p/>Tom turned away and ran down the steps, wanting to scream. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ran all the way to Dickie's house and sat on the couch in Dickie's living room for a few moments, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) mind shocked and empty.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) went into Dickie's bedroom and walked around for a few moments, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) pockets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wondered when Dickie was coming back. Or was he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) going to stay all afternoon, really take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) to bed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) opened Dickie's closet door and looked in. There was a new-looking gray suit. Tom took it out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shorts and put on the gray pants. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) put on a pair of Dickie's shoes. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) opened the bottom drawer and took out a clean blue and white shirt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marge, you must understand that I don't love you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said into the mirror in Dickie's voice. <div class="bookquote">``Marge, stop it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom turned suddenly and made a move in the air pretending to grab Marge's throat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>), twisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) down to the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was breathing heavily. <div class="bookquote">``You know why I had to do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, addressing Marge, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) watched himself in the mirror. <div class="bookquote">``You were coming between Tom and me - No, not that! But there is something between us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turned, stepped over the imaginary body, and went to the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could see the bottom of the steps that led up to Marge's house. Maybe they were sleeping together, Tom thought with disgust. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ran back to the closet and took a hat from the top shelf. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) put it on. It surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked like Dickie with the top part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) head covered. Really it was only his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) darker hair that was very different from Dickie. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) nose, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) narrow jaw, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) eyes -

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What're you doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom turned around quickly. Dickie was in the doorway.<div class="bookquote">'' Oh - just amusing myself. Sorry, Dickie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickie slammed the door loudly. <div class="bookquote">``Please get out of my clothes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you and Marge OK?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom tried to calm himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) hung up the suit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marge and I are fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie yelled. <div class="bookquote">``Another thing I want to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) said, looking at Tom, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not in love with you. I don't know if you have the idea that I am or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In love with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom smiled weakly.<div class="bookquote">'' I never thought you were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Marge thinks you're in love with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom felt the blood go out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``What have I ever done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just the way you act,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie said, and went out of the door.

<p/>Tom quickly put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shorts back on and followed Dickie. Just because Dickie liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>), Tom thought, Marge had spread her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) dirty ideas about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to Dickie. <div class="bookquote">``Are you in love with Marge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but I feel sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>). I care about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>)'s been very nice to me. We've had some good times together. You don't seem to be able to understand that. I'm going to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) friendship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, have I done anything to prevent you? I told you, Dickie, I'd rather leave than do anything to hurt your friendship with Marge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickie looked at Tom. <div class="bookquote">``No, you haven't done anything, specifically, but it's obvious you don't like her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) around.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said sincerely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hadn't made more of an effort, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had done a bad job.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let's forget it. Marge and 1 are OK.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie turned away and stared out at the water.

<p/>Tom went into the kitchen to make himself some coffee. This wasn't the time to be too friendly with Dickie. Dickie had his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) pride. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) would be silent for most of the afternoon, then come back in by about five o'clock after he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had been painting for a time, and everything would be the same as before. One thing Tom was sure of: Dickie was glad to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) here. Dickie was bored with living by himself, and bored with Marge, too. Tom still had three hundred dollars left, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and Dickie were going to use it on a trip to Paris.



<p/>Chapter four

<p/>A Loss of Control.

<p/>The next day, Tom walked down to the post office. There were two letters, one to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) from Dickie's father, one to Dickie from someone in New York who Tom didn't know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walked quickly home as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) opened Mr. Greenleaf's letter, unfolding the typewritten sheet respectfully.

<p/>Nov. 10,19



<p/>My dear Tom,

<p/>Since you have been with Dickie over a month and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) shows no more sign of coming home than before you went, it is clear to me that you haven't been successful. I realize that you reported sincerely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) is considering returning, but honestly, I don't see it anywhere in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) letter of October 26. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) seems more determined than ever to stay where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) is.

<p/>I want you to know that my wife and I appreciate whatever efforts you have made for us. From today, I have no further need of your assistance. I hope you have not troubled yourself greatly by your efforts of the last month, and I sincerely hope the trip has given you some pleasure despite the failure of its main goal.

<p/>Both my wife and I send you greetings and our thanks.

<p/>Sincerely, H. R. Greenleaf



<p/>Tom walked into the house. It was the end. Mr. Greenleaf had simply fired him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) had failed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) stood at the corner of the terrace, staring out at the city and thinking of nothing, feeling lost and alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) turned as he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) heard the gate open. Dickie walked up the path, smiling, but Tom thought it was an unnatural, polite smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a letter for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) handed Dickie his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) letter and put the one from Mr. Greenleaf into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) pocket.

<p/>When Dickie had finished reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) letter - a letter that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) laugh out loud as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) read it - Tom said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you think Marge would like to go up to Paris with us when we go? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Dickie looked surprised. <div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said cheerfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know if I should go up to Paris,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie said. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't mind getting away somewhere for a few days, but Paris -''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) lighted a cigarette. <div class="bookquote">``I'd rather go to San Remo or even Genoa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Paris - Genoa can't compare with Paris, can it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, of course not, but it's a lot closer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But when will we get to Paris?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Any time. Paris'll still be there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom ran from the hall into the kitchen and fixed himself an iceless drink. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands were shaking. Only yesterday Dickie had said, <div class="bookquote">``Are you going home for Christmas?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>very quietly in the middle of a conversation, but Dickie knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wasn't going home for Christmas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) didn't have a home and Dickie knew it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had told Dickie all about Aunt Dottie in Boston. It was simply what Dickie wanted, that was all. Marge was full of plans for Christmas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) couldn't bear to imagine it. All right, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'d leave.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'d do anything rather than spend Christmas with them.

<p/>***

<p/>Marge said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) didn't care to go with them to San Remo. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was busy working on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) book. The book must be awful, Tom thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had known writers. You didn't write a book while spending half the day on the beach.

<p/>They took only one suitcase of Dickie's for the two of them, because they planned to be away only three nights and four days. Dickie was in a slightly more cheerful mood, but the awful feeling was still there, the feeling that this was the last trip they would make together anywhere.

<p/>Dickie said absolutely nothing on the train to San Remo. Tom sat opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), staring at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) handsome, expressionless face, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands with the two rings: one green and one gold. Tom decided to steal the green ring when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) left. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would do it the very last day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stared at Dickie's closed eyes. A crazy emotion of hate, of warmth, of impatience, and frustration was rising in him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>), preventing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) breathing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wanted to kill Dickie.

<p/>It was not the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had thought of it. Before, once or twice or three times, it had been a desire that went away immediately and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) with a feeling of shame. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) thought about it for a whole minute, two minutes, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was leaving Dickie anyway, and what was there to be ashamed of any more? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had offered Dickie friendship, and respect, everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had to offer, and Dickie had answered with coldness and now dislike. Dickie was just pushing him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) out in the cold. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) on this trip, Tom thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could simply say that there had been an accident. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could - He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had just thought of something brilliant: he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could become Dickie Greenleaf himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could do everything that Dickie did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) could go back to Mongibello first and collect Dickie's things, tell Marge a story, rent an apartment in Rome or Paris, receive Dickie's check every month, and sign Dickie's name on it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) could step right into Dickie's shoes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) began to think of how.

<p/>The water. But Dickie was such a good swimmer. The cliffs. It would be easy to push Dickie off a cliff when they took a walk, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) imagined Dickie grabbing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) and pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) off with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) felt nervous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) would have to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) hair more blond. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wouldn't live in a place, of course, where somebody who knew Dickie lived. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had only to look enough like Dickie to be able to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) passport.

<p/>Dickie opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) eyes, looking right at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>), and Tom relaxed, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) head back and shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) eyes quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom, are you OK?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie asked, shaking Tom's knee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``OK,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said, smiling a little. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) saw Dickie sit back with a look of anger, and Tom knew why; because Dickie had hated giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) even that much attention. Tom smiled to himself, amused at pretending to be asleep. That had been the only way to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) thoughts from Dickie.

<p/>San Remo. Flowers. A main street along the beach, shops and stores, and French, English, and Italian tourists. Tom searched his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brain. Where? In one of these little streets tonight? In the water? It was slightly cloudy, though not cold. It would be easy in the hotel room, too, but how would he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) get rid of the body? That left only the water, and Dickie was very comfortable in the water. There were boats, rowboats and little motorboats, that people could rent down at the beach. In each motorboat, Tom noticed, was a heavy, round, cement anchor tied to a rope to prevent the boat from floating away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't we take a boat, Dickie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom asked, trying not to sound eager.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, all right. For an hour around the port,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie said.

<p/>The Italian boatman started the motor for them. Then Dickie took the wheel and they headed straight out from the town.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where're you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom shouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie smiled.

<p/>No it didn't.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You dare me to jump in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom asked, beginning to take off his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) jacket.

<p/>Dickie only laughed at this suggestion, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) mouth wide, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) eyes fixed on the distance in front of the boat. Tom kept on undressing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoes and socks off. Under his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pants he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) swimsuit, like Dickie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go in if you will!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wanted Dickie to slow down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will I? Sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie slowed the motor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) let go of the wheel and took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) jacket. The boat moved up and down, losing its speed. <div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie said, nodding at Tom's pants. <div class="bookquote">``Take them off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom looked at the land. They were a long way from the white sand and pink houses of San Remo now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) picked up the oar slowly, playing with it between his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knees, and when Dickie was pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) pants down, Tom lifted the oar and swung it down hard on the top of Dickie's head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie yelled, sliding half off the wooden seat.

<p/>Tom stood up and brought the oar down again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the...!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) lost consciousness.

<p/>Tom hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) on the side of the neck three times. Finally the body relaxed and stopped moving. Tom straightened, getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) breath back painfully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked around him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). There were no boats, nothing, except far, far away a little white one moving from left to right.

<p/>Tom stopped and pulled at Dickie's green ring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pocket. The other ring was tighter, but it came off, over the bleeding hand. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) reached for the rope that was tied to the heavy weight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) guessed the rope was about fourteen or fifteen meters long. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) began to feel cooler and calmer. The cement weight should be just enough to hold a body down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought. The body might move around a little, but it wouldn't come up to the surface.

<p/>Tom pulled the body toward the edge of the boat, sliding it along the side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) began with Dickies head and shoulders, turned Dickie's body on its stomach, and pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) out little by little. Dickie's head was in the water. Tom took a breath and pushed hard. Dickie went over the side of the boat.

<p/>Tom started the boat cautiously and headed toward the shore, north of San Remo. Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could find a place, an empty area on the shore, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could stop the boat and get out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't think of a way to get rid of the boat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) moved it toward a shallow, short beach until he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt it hit ground. Tom decided to sink the boat.

<p/>The little beach gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a feeling of safety and privacy. There was no sign that a human foot had ever touched the place.

<p/>Tom began to gather stones and to drop them into the boat one by one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) worked without stopping because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was afraid somebody might find him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stopped to rest. When the stones reached the top of the boat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pushed the boat away from the beach and pushed it down, more and more, until water entered over the sides. As the boat began to sink, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gave it another push toward deeper water and walked with it until the water was up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) waist and the boat sank below his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) reach. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walked back to shore and lay down for a time, face down on the sand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) began to plan his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) story for the return to Mongibello.

<p/>***

<p/>Tom stepped off the bus almost directly in front of Marge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) swimsuit and the white jacket she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) always wore to the beach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Dickie?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s in Rome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom smiled easily, absolutely prepared for Marge's questions. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s staying up there for a few days. I came down to get some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) stuff to take up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) staying with somebody?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, just in a hotel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom began to walk toward the house and Marge followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). Tom took the big iron key to the terrace door from its usual place. The table had been moved a little, and there was a book on the chair. Marge had been here since they left, Tom thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I fix you a drink? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, thanks. How long do you think Dickie's going to be away?

<p/>Tom frowned thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't really know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wants to see a lot of art shows up there. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s just enjoying a change of scene.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long are you staying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just overnight. I'll be going up to Rome tomorrow. Probably in the afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose I'll see you again, unless you're at the beach. Have a good time in case I don't see you. And tell Dickie to write a postcard. What hotel is he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) staying at?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh - uh - what's the name of it? Near the Piazza di Spagna?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Inghilterra?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it. But I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) said to use the American Express as a mailing address.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right. Bye.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>Marge walked down the path to the iron gate, and out.

<p/>Tom picked up the suitcase and ran upstairs to Dickie's bedroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) opened the drawers quickly and emptied them into the suitcase. There were letters, keys, address books, and clothes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wanted to take all of Dickies stuff straight away to Rome, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) worried about what Marge might think if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took so much for such a short time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) decided it would be better to pretend that Dickie had later made a decision to move to Rome.

<p/>The next day, Tom worked calmly and thoroughly, expecting Marge to come by at any minute, but it was after four before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) asked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) came into Dickie's room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I had a letter from Dickie today. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s decided he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s going to move to Rome.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom stood up and smiled a little. It seemed to be a surprise to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), too. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wants me to pick up all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) things, all I can carry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Move to Rome? For how long? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. The rest of the winter, at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s not coming back all winter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>Marge sounded lost already.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) might even sell the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s still going to Cortina, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>Marge asked. Dickie and Marge had been planning to go on a Christmas vacation to Cortina with Freddie Miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was going to write Freddie and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) decided not to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) shocked face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was wondering whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was going to live with Dickie or not, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was probably deciding, because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) cheerful manner, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was. Tom felt the question move up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) lips - and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Are you going to stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) in Rome?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe for a time. I'll help him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) apartment. I want to go to Paris this month, then I suppose around the middle of December I'll be going back to the States.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div><p/>A few minutes later, Marge stood up and said goodbye. Tom suddenly felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) might be going to telephone Dickie today. Or maybe even go up to Rome. But what could she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) do if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) did go? People change hotels. And there were enough hotels in Rome to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) busy for days. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) didn't find him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) would suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had gone to Paris or to another city with Tom Ripley.



<p/>Chapter five

<p/>A New Identity.

<p/>Tom left Mongibello by taxi around six o'clock, after a cup of coffee at Giorgio's, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Giorgio</b></font>) said goodbye to his (<font color='blue'><b>Giorgio</b></font>) and Dickie's village friends. To all of them he (<font color='blue'><b>Giorgio</b></font>) told the same story, that Mr. Greenleaf was staying in Rome for the winter, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) greetings until he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) saw them again.

<p/>On the train, Tom wrote a letter to Marge. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arrived at the hotel in Rome, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) typed it on Dickie's typewriter.



<p/>Rome

<p/>November 28

<p/>Dear Marge,

<p/>I've decided to take an apartment in Rome for the winter, just to have a change of scene and get away from old Mongy. I feel a need to be by myself. I'm sorry it was so sudden and that I didn't get a chance to say goodbye, but actually I'm not far away, and I hope I'll see you now and then. I just didn't feel like going to pack my stuff, so I gave the job to Tom.

<p/>You had the wrong idea about Tom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s going back to the States soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s really not a bad guy and I don't dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) has nothing to do with us anyway, and I hope you realize that.

<p/>Write me at the American Express, Rome, until I know where I am. I'm terribly sorry about Christmas, darling, but I don't think I should see you so soon, and you can hate me or not for that.

<p/>All my love, Dickie



<p/>Tom had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hat on when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) entered the hotel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gave Dickie's passport in at the desk instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) also signed in with Dickie's signature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) spent that evening practicing Dickies signature for the bank checks. Dickie's monthly income was going to arrive from America in less than ten days.

<p/>Tom moved the next day to the Hotel Europa near the Via Veneto. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) held imaginary conversations with Marge and Freddie in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hotel room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) as Dickie in case she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) called. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had done so little to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) appearance, but even his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) expression, Tom thought, was like Dickie's now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wore a smile that was dangerously welcoming to a stranger, a smile perfect to greet an old friend or a lover. It was Dickie's best and most typical smile when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was in a good mood.

<p/>On January 4 there was a letter from Marge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was giving up her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) house on March 1, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) wrote:



<p/>When am I going to see you? I hate missing a summer in Europe after I've lived through another awful winter, but I think I'll go home in early March. Darling, it would be so wonderful if we could go home on the same boat together.

<p/>Is there a possibility? I don't suppose there is. You're not going back to the US even for a short visit this winter?

<p/>As ever, Marge



<p/>On January 10, Tom wrote back to Marge:



<p/>I'm painting with a man called Di Massimo and am quite pleased with the results. I miss you, too, but if you can still live with my plan, I'd prefer not to see you for several more weeks. Hello to Giorgio and his (<font color='blue'><b>Giorgio</b></font>) wife...



<p/>It was a letter like all of Dickie's letters, a letter that couldn't be called warm or cold, and said almost nothing.

<p/>Tom was receiving Dickie's checks now, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had enough money to live as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wanted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had found an apartment in a large apartment house in the Via Imperiale, near the Pincian Gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had signed a contract to stay a year, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't plan to spend most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) time in Rome, especially the winter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) only wanted a home, after years of not having one. And Rome was exciting. Rome was part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) new life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wanted to be able to say in Majorca or Athens or Cairo or wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I live in Rome, I keep an apartment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the way the international upper classes referred to their apartments. The apartment had a large living room, a bedroom, a kind of sitting room, kitchen, and bath. It suited the respectable neighborhood and the respectable life he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wanted to lead.

<p/>Tom carefully avoided the Americans in Rome who might expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to come to their parties and ask them to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) loved to chat with Americans and Italians in the Cafe Greco and in the students' restaurants in the Via Margutta. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greco</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Greco</b></font>) name only to an Italian painter named Carlino, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Greco</b></font>) met in a Via Margutta bar; told him (<font color='blue'><b>Greco</b></font>) also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Greco</b></font>) painted and was studying with a painter called Di Massimo. If the police ever asked, this man could now tell them that Dickie Greenleaf had been painting in Rome in January.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) had a ticket for Majorca - by train to Naples, then the boat from Naples to Palma over the night of January 31 and February 1. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) had bought two new suitcases from Guccis, the best leather products store in Rome.

<p/>While Tom was packing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) suitcases one morning, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) doorbell rang. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) supposed it was a salesperson, or a mistake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had no name on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) doorbell downstairs because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't like people to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). It rang for the second time, and Tom still ignored it, and went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lazy packing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) loved to pack, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took a long time about it, a whole day or two days, laying Dickie's clothes carefully into suitcases, now and then trying on a good-looking shirt or a jacket in front of the mirror. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was standing in front of the mirror with one of Dickie's shirts, when there was a knock at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) door.

<p/>It might be someone from Mongibello - someone who had found his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) address and wanted to surprise him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>). That was silly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) told himself. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) hands were cool with sweat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) went to the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) felt faint, and was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) would fall down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) opened the door with both hands, though only a few centimeters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the American voice said out of the darkness of the hall. <div class="bookquote">``Dickie? It's Freddie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom took a step back, holding the door open. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s - Won't you come in? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s not here right now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) should be back a little later.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddie/Freddie Miles/Miles</b></font>)</div><p/>Freddie Miles came in, looking around. His (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) fat, ugly face turned in every direction. How had he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) found the place, Tom wondered. Tom took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rings off quickly and pocketed them. And what else? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), too, looked around the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're staying with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddie/Freddie Miles/Miles</b></font>)</div>Freddie asked, with that strange stare that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) face look stupid and rather scared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no. I'm just staying here for a few hours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said, calmly removing Dickie's shirt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had another shirt on under it. <div class="bookquote">``Dickies gone for lunch. Otello's, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) should be back around three at the latest.''  (<font color='red'><b>the apartment owners</b></font>)</div>One of the apartment owners had probably let Freddie in, Tom thought, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) which bell to press, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Mr. Greenleaf was in, too. Freddie had probably said he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) was an old friend of Dickie's. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) would have to get Freddie out of the house without seeing Signora Buffi downstairs, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) always called out, <div class="bookquote">``Hello, Mr. Greenleaf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I met you in Mongibello, didn't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddie/Freddie Miles/Miles</b></font>)</div>Freddie asked. <div class="bookquote">``Aren't you Tom? I thought you were coming to Cortina.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't go, thanks. How was the trip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, fine. What happened to Dickie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) write to you? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) decided to spend the winter in Rome. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'d written to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word. Marge told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'d moved to Rome, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) didn't have the address except the American Express office. It was only by luck that I met somebody at a restaurant last night who knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) lived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddie/Freddie Miles/Miles</b></font>)</div><p/>Freddie had walked toward the bedroom and stopped, looking at the suitcases on the bed. <div class="bookquote">``Is Dickie leaving for somewhere, or did he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) just get here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) asked, turning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s leaving. Didn't Marge tell you? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s going to Sicily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow. Or late tonight. I'm not quite sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So what's the matter with Dickie lately?''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddie/Freddie Miles/Miles</b></font>)</div>Freddie asked, frowning. <div class="bookquote">``What's the idea of hiding from everybody?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s been working pretty hard this winter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) seems to want privacy, but as far as I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s still friendly with everybody, including Marge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom turned around and saw Freddie staring at the silver identification bracelet on his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) left wrist. It was Dickie's bracelet, which Tom had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wearing, but had found with Dickie's clothes. Freddie had clearly seen it before. Tom put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) coat slowly and calmly.

<p/>Freddie was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) now with a different expression, with a little surprise. Tom knew what Freddie was thinking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) sensed danger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ready to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You live here, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom protested, smiling. The fat, ugly face stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) from under the bright red hair. If they could get out without seeing Signora Buffi downstairs, Tom thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would be safe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you're wearing Dickie's jewelry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom couldn't think of a single thing to say, a single joke to make. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, just for a day or two,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) deepest voice. <div class="bookquote">``Dickie got tired of wearing it, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) told me to wear it.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) meant the identification bracelet, but there was also the silver pin on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tie, with the G on it. Tom had bought the pin himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could feel the anger growing in Freddie Miles. Tom was afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm ready to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddie/Freddie Miles/Miles</b></font>)</div>Freddie said seriously, getting up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've just remembered I have to make a telephone call,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said. <div class="bookquote">``I'll meet you there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddie/Freddie Miles/Miles</b></font>)</div><p/>Freddie walked to the door and turned with a swing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) broad shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``That's the Otello not far from the Inghilterra?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s supposed to be there by one o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddie/Freddie Miles/Miles</b></font>)</div><p/>Freddie nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Nice to see you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said in an unfriendly manner, and closed the door.

<p/>Tom whispered a curse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) opened the door slightly and listened to the sound of Freddie's shoes going down the stairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) wanted to make sure Freddie left without speaking to one of the Buffis again. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) heard Freddie's <div class="bookquote">``Hello, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddie/Freddie Miles/Miles</b></font>)</div><p/>Freddie was talking with Signora Buffi. The woman's voice came more clearly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''... only Mr. Greenleaf,''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was saying. <div class="bookquote">``No, only one... Mr. Who?... No, sir... I do not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has gone out today at all, but I could be wrong!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) laughed.

<p/>Tom twisted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands, imagining that they were around Freddie's neck. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heard Freddie's footsteps running up the stairs. Tom stepped back into the apartment and closed the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could go on saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't live here, that Dickie was at Otello's, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) didn't know where Dickie was, but Freddie wouldn't stop now until he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) found Dickie. Or Freddie would drag him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) downstairs and ask Signora Buffi who he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) was.

<p/>Freddie knocked on the door. The handle turned. It was locked. Tom picked up a heavy glass ashtray. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't get his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand around it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had to hold it by the edge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tried to think just for two seconds more: wasn't there another solution? What would he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) do with the body? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't think. This was the only way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) opened the door with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) left hand. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) right hand, with the glass ashtray, was pulled back and down.

<p/>Freddie came into the room. <div class="bookquote">``Listen, would you mind telling...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Freddie</b></font>)</div><p/>The hard edge of the ashtray hit the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) head. Freddie looked shocked. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) knees bent and he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) went down like a bull hit between the eyes with a hammer, Tom kicked the door shut. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) slammed the edge of the ashtray into the back of Freddie's neck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) hit the neck again and again, scared that Freddie might be only pretending and that one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) great arms might suddenly grab his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) legs and pull him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) down. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) felt Freddie's wrist for a pulse. There was a faint one, though it seemed to stop as he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) touched. In the next second it was gone.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) searched Freddie's pockets. A wallet. The American passport in the inside pocket of the overcoat. Mixed Italian and some other kind of coins. Two car keys on a ring that said FIAT. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) searched the wallet for a license. There it was, with all the details. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) went to the front window, then nearly smiled because it was so simple: there stood the black car across the street, almost directly in front of the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) could not be sure, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) thought there was no one in it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) suddenly knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) was going to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) set Freddie up against the wall, and poured some strong alcohol from a bottle down his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) throat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) had hours of time, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) didn't stop until the room was ready, the two dozen smoked cigarettes and a glass of alcohol broken and only half-cleaned up from the bathroom floor. The curious thing was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) would have the whole apartment cleaned up by eight o'clock. According to the story he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) was going to tell, Freddie would leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) house by seven, and Dickie Greenleaf was a fairly neat young man, even with a few drinks in him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>). Tom was dirtying the house only so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would believe the story he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was going to tell.

<p/>At ten to eight, Tom dragged Freddie's dead body out of the apartment and began to walk down the stairs. On the way down he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) stopped, hearing someone come out of an apartment on the second floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) waited for a moment and then continued. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) didn't want to rest going down the stairs. Fortunately nobody else came out of any of the apartments or in the front door.

<p/>The street looked normal. If anyone came over, Tom thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would blow such a breath of alcohol in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face that there wouldn't be any reason to ask what was the matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) paused a moment for a car to pass and then took a few heavy steps to Freddie's car. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) pushed Freddie's head and one shoulder through the open window of the car while he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) breathed deeply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I help you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a voice asked in Italian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, no, no, thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom replied with drunken happiness. <div class="bookquote">'' I know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lives,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said in English.

<p/>The man nodded, smiling a little, too, and walked on.

<p/>Tom swung Freddie out on the door, pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) around the door and onto the car seat, came around the car, and pulled Freddie into the seat beside the drivers seat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) put Freddie's key in and the car started quickly. They were off. Down the hill to the Via Veneto, past the American Library, over to the Piazza Venezia, through the Forum, past the Colosseum, a grand tour of Rome that Freddie could not appreciate.

<p/>Tom began to look around for the right spot. There was a place ahead with three or four trees near the edge of the road and surely a tomb behind them. Tom pulled off the road by the trees and shut off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lights. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) waited a moment, watching both ends of the straight, empty road.

<p/>Freddie's body was still soft. Tom dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) roughly now through the dirt and stopped behind the last tree, behind what remained of a tomb, which was probably only a meter high, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought, and quite good enough for this pig. Tom cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ugly weight and kicked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) suddenly in the chin. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walked back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) car on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) exhausted, weak legs and turned the car around toward Rome again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was tired, tired to the point of crying, and sick of the sight of Freddie Miles.



<p/>Chapter six

<p/>The Hunt for Clues.

<p/>Tom went out before eight in the morning to buy the papers. There was nothing. They might not find Freddie for days, Tom thought. Nobody was likely to walk around an unimportant tomb like the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had put Freddie behind.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) was dressed by nine and had even spoken to Signora Buffi to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) would be gone for at least three weeks.

<p/>The telephone rang, and Tom picked it up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Greenleaf?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the Italian voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Frederick Miles</b></font>)</div><p/>The voice stated that the body of Frederick Miles had been found that morning and hadn't Mr. Miles visited him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) yesterday afternoon?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that is true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you be kind enough to answer some questions? A police officer will come to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will be very glad to help if I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said in slow, careful Italian, <div class="bookquote">``but can the officer come now? It is necessary for me to leave the house at ten o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>The voice made a little sound and said probably not, but they would try.

<p/>Tom hurried to push a couple of suitcases under the bed, and carried the other to a closet and shut the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't want the police to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was planning to leave town. But what was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) nervous about? They probably didn't have any clues.

<p/>Maybe a friend of Freddies had known that Freddie was going to try to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) yesterday, that was all. Tom picked up a paint brush and put it in a cup of water. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't want to look too upset by the news of Freddie's death to do a little painting while he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) waited for them, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) was dressed to go out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) was going to be a friend of Freddie's, but not a very close friend.

<p/>Signora Buffi let the police in at ten-thirty. There were two: an older man in the uniform of an officer and a younger man in an ordinary police uniform. The older man greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) politely and asked to see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passport. Tom produced it, and the officer looked carefully from Tom to the picture of Dickie, more carefully than anyone had ever looked at it before. Tom thought the officer would ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) about it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) handed Tom the passport with a little smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How was he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) killed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was hit on the head and in the neck by a heavy object,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>the officer replied, <div class="bookquote">``and robbed. We think he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was drunk. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) drunk when he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) left your apartment yesterday afternoon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well - a little. We had both been drinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The officer</b></font>)</div><p/>The officer wrote this down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) book, and also the time that Tom said Freddie had been there, from, about twelve until about six.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know where he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was going when he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) left?''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>the officer asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you thought he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was able to drive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes. If he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had been too drunk to drive, I would have gone with him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>The officer</b></font>)</div><p/>The officer asked another question that Tom pretended not quite to understand. The officer asked it a second time, choosing different words, and smiled at the younger police officer. The officer wanted to know what his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) relationship to Freddie had been.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said. <div class="bookquote">``Not a very close friend. I had not seen or heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in about two months. I was terribly upset to hear about the disaster this morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom let his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) anxious face express what his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rather simple vocabulary couldn't. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) succeeded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought the questioning wasn't very serious, and that they were going to leave in another minute or two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said nothing about making a trip to the Via Appia when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) left your apartment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you do yesterday after Mr. Miles left?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I stayed here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said, moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) open hands as Dickie had done,<div class="bookquote">'' and then I had a little sleep, and later I went out for a walk around eight or eight-thirty.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>A man who lived in the house, whose name Tom didn't know, had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) come in last night at about a quarter to nine, and they had said good evening to each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You took a walk alone? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mr. Miles left here alone? He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was not going to meet anybody?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) didn't say so.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom wondered if Freddie had had friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hotel, or wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been staying. Tom hoped that the police wouldn't introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to any of Freddie's friends who might know Dickie. Now his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) name - Richard Greenleaf - would be in the Italian newspapers, Tom thought, and also his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) address. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d have to move. It was awful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cursed to himself. The police officer saw him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), but it looked like a curse against the sad end of Freddie, Tom thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are searching the car now. Maybe the murderer was somebody he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) picked up to give a ride to. Shall we be able to reach you here for the next few days, in case there are any more questions? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``I was planning to leave for Majorca tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry, but we may need to contact you in the next couple of days,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stated quietly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not giving Tom the opportunity to argue about it, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was an American. <div class="bookquote">``We shall inform you as soon as you may go. I am sorry if you have made travel plans. Perhaps there is still time to change them. Good day, Mr. Greenleaf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom stood there after they had closed the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could move to a hotel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) told the police what hotel it was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't want Freddie's friends or any friends of Dickie's coming to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) after they saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) address in the newspapers.

<p/>Before an hour had passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was at the Inghilterra. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) three suitcases, two of them Dickie's and one his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) own, depressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had packed them for such a different purpose. And now this!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) went out at noon to buy the papers. Every one of the papers had the news:

<p/>AMERICAN MURDERED ON THE VIA APPIA ANTICA... SHOCKING MURDER OF WEALTHY AMERICAN FREDERICK MILES LAST NIGHT ON THE VIA APPIA... VIA APPIA MURDER OF AMERICAN WITHOUT CLUES...

<p/>Tom read every word. There really were no clues, at least not yet, and no suspects. But every paper gave the name Herbert Richard Greenleaf and gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) address as the place where Freddie had last been seen by anybody.

<p/>The phone didn't ring all afternoon. At about eight, when it was dark, Tom went downstairs to buy the evening papers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sat in a little restaurant a few streets away, reading them. Still no clues.

<p/>Tom drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) glass of wine slowly, and looked through each of the papers for the last-minute articles that were sometimes put into Italian papers just before they came out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) found nothing more on the Miles case. But on the last page of the last newspaper he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) read: SUNKEN BOAT WITH BLOODSTAINS FOUND NEAR SAN REMO

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) read it rapidly, with more terror in his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) heart than he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) had felt when he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) had carried Freddie's body down the stairs, or when the police had come to question him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>). This was like a bad dream come true. The boat was described in detail and it brought the scene back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) - Dickie smiling in the boat, Dickie smiling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>), Dickie's body sinking through the water. The article said that the stains were believed to be blood, not that they were. It didn't say what the police or anybody else planned to do about them. But the police would do something, Tom thought. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) imagination went in several directions: what would they think if they searched for Dickie's body and found it? They would think that it was Tom Ripley's now. Dickie would be suspected of murder. Then Dickie would be suspected of Freddie's murder, too. Tom sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) room wondering what would happen if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did nothing, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could make happen by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own actions.

<p/>Marge would come up to Rome. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) had obviously called the Rome police to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) address. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) came up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would have to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) as Tom, and try to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) that Dickie was out, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had with Freddie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) mustn't see Marge, that was all. Everything would be a disaster if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>). It'd be the end of everything! But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) could be patient, nothing at all would happen. It was just this moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) thought, just this murder, that made things so difficult. But absolutely nothing would happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) could keep doing and saying the right things to everybody. Afterward everything would be OK again.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) picked up the telephone, and told the man at the hotel desk that if Miss Marjorie Sherwood called again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) would accept the call. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) could persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Sherwood</b></font>) in two minutes that everything was all right and that Freddie's murder didn't concern him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) would say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) had moved to a hotel to avoid annoying telephone calls from strangers but still be within reach of the police in case they wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) to identify any suspects they picked up.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) lay down on the bed, tired, but not ready to undress. Tom imagined Dickie smiling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>), dressed in the suit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had worn in San Remo. The suit and tie were completely wet. Dickie bent over him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>), shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I swam!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Tom, wake up! I'm all right! I swam! I'm alive!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom moved away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) touch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heard Dickie laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>), Dickie's happy, deep laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I swam!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Dickie's voice yelled, ringing and ringing in Tom's ears.

<p/>Tom looked around the room, looking for Dickie in the yellow light under the lamp, in the dark corner. Tom felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own eyes open wide, frightened, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fear was silly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) kept looking everywhere for Dickie, below the curtains at the window, and on the floor on the other side of the bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) pulled himself up from the bed and walked, almost falling, across the room, and opened a window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) felt drugged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) sat beneath the window, breathing the cold air in. Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) went into the bathroom and wet his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) face at the sink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had let his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) imagination go crazy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had been out of control.

<p/>***

<p/>The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) thought of when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) woke up was Marge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) reached for the telephone and asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) had called during the night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) hadn't. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had a terrible feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was coming up to Rome.

<p/>Very strangely, there was nothing in the papers about either the Miles case or the San Remo boat. It frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>).

<p/>The telephone rang and he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) jumped for it obediently. It was either Marge or the police.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are two officers of the police downstairs to see you, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A minute later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) heard their footsteps in the carpeted hall. It was the same older officer as yesterday, with a different younger policeman.

<p/>They took the chairs Tom offered. <div class="bookquote">``Are you a friend of the American Thomas Ripley?''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>the older officer asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) went back to America about a month ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see. That will have to be checked. You see, we are trying to find Thomas Ripley. We think he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) may be dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead? Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The officer</b></font>)</div><p/>The officer seemed to be smiling between each sentence. The smile had bothered Tom a little yesterday, too. <div class="bookquote">``You were with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) on a trip to San Remo in November, were you not? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They had checked the hotels. <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you last see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>)? In San Remo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) again in Rome.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom remembered that Marge knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had gone back to Rome after Mongibello, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was going to help Dickie in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) new apartment in Rome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When did you last see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know the exact date. Something like two months ago, I think. I think I had a postcard from - from Genoa, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) was going back to America. Why do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) is dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you take a boat ride with Thomas Ripley in San Remo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we did. Yes, I remember. Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because a little boat has been found with some kind of stains on it that may be blood. It was lost on November 25 - the day you were in San Remo with Mr. Ripley.''  (<font color='red'><b>The officer</b></font>)</div>The officer's eyes rested on him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) without moving.

<p/>The friendliness of the look angered Tom. It wasn't honest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) made an effort to behave well. <div class="bookquote">``But nothing happened to us on the boat ride. There was no accident.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you bring the boat back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course.''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>It was obvious what was going on in the officer's head: Dickie Greenleaf had twice been on the scene of a murder, or near enough. The missing Thomas Ripley had taken a boat ride on November 25 with Dickie Greenleaf. <div class="bookquote">``Are you saying you do not believe me when I tell you that I saw Tom Ripley in Rome around December 1?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, I didn't say that! I wanted to hear what you would say about your travels with Mr. Ripley after San Remo, because we cannot find him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) smiled again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>)'s not in America, you could try Paris or Genoa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>the officer said. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) papers away. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had made at least a dozen notes on them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Before you go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said in a nervous voice, <div class="bookquote">``I want to ask you when I can leave the city. I was planning to go to Sicily. I would very much like to leave today if it is possible. I plan to stay at the Hotel Palma in Palermo. It will be very simple for you to reach me if I am needed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Palermo,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>the officer repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Well, that may be possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div><p/>After making a phone call to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) station, the officer turned to Tom, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you may go to Palermo today.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walked with the two of them to the door. <div class="bookquote">``If you find where Tom Ripley is, please let me know, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said sincerely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course! We shall keep you informed, sir. Good day!''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter seven

<p/>The Waiting Game.

<p/>Tom had no plan to try to run away from anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) just wanted to get out of Rome. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was desperate to get out! He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) threw the last objects into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) suitcase and slammed the lid down and locked it.

<p/>The phone again! Tom picked it up quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Hello?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Dickie - !''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Marge and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was downstairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could tell from the sound. Surprised, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said in Tom's voice,<div class="bookquote">'' Who's this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marge! Well, hello. Where are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can come up in about five minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said with a laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Dickie there? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at the moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) went out about a half an hour ago, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'ll be back soon. I know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) is, if you want to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At the eighty-third police station. No, excuse me, it's the eighty-seventh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) in any trouble? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, just answering questions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was supposed to be there at ten. Want me to give you the address?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hadn't started talking in Tom's voice: why hadn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pretended to be a servant, some friend of Dickie's, anybody, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) that Dickie was out for hours?

<p/>Marge wasn't happy. <div class="bookquote">``No - o. I'll wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said, pretending to find the address. <div class="bookquote">``Twenty-one Via Perugia. Do you know where that is?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom didn't, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was going to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) in the opposite direction from the American Express, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wanted to go for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mail before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) left town.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>Marge said.<div class="bookquote">'' I'll come up and wait with you if it's all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's -''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) laughed the laugh that Marge knew so well. <div class="bookquote">``The thing is, I'm expecting somebody any minute. It's a business interview. About a job. Believe it or not, old Ripley's trying to put himself to work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>said Marge, not in the least interested. <div class="bookquote">``Well, how is Dickie? Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) have to talk to the police?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Just because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had some drinks with Freddie that day. You saw the papers, didn't you? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long has Dickie been living here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here? Oh, just overnight. I've been up north.

He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s been worried about what you might think of all this in the papers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>Marge said, surprised, but obviously pleased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you wait for me in Angelo's? It's that bar right down the street in front of the hotel as you go toward the Piazza di Spagna steps. I'll see if I can come out and have a drink or a coffee with you in about five minutes, OK?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, all right. Angelo's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't miss it. On the street straight in front of the hotel. Bye-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom quickly called for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bill to be prepared and for somebody to carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) luggage, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walked downstairs.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wanted to see if Marge was still in the hotel, waiting there for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), or possibly still there making another telephone call.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) wasn't there. Tom paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bill. <div class="bookquote">``If anybody asks for me, would you say that I've left the city?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom asked the man at the desk.

<p/>Tom went out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) waiting taxi. <div class="bookquote">``Would you take me to the American Express, please?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) asked the driver.

<p/>***

<p/>The boat approached Palermo harbor slowly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palermo</b></font>) had spent two days in Naples, and there had been nothing of any interest in the papers and the police had made no attempt to contact him (<font color='blue'><b>Palermo</b></font>). But maybe they had just not bothered to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palermo</b></font>) in Naples, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palermo</b></font>) thought, and were waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Palermo</b></font>) in Palermo at the hotel. But there were no police on the dock and no police in the hotel either. Tom felt so happy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went over to the mail counter and asked boldly if there was any message for Mr. Richard Greenleaf. The clerk told him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) there wasn't.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) began to relax. There wasn't even a message from Marge. Maybe Marge had given Dickie up after this situation. Maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>)'d realized that Dickie was running away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) dressed, put on one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) new traveling suits, and walked out into the Palermo early evening. There across the square was the great cathedral he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had read about in a guidebook. Tomorrow he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) would begin his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) visit, but this moment was wonderful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) stopped to stare at the tall cathedral in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>). Wonderful to look at the dusty walls and to think of going inside tomorrow, to imagine its smell, made up of hundreds and hundreds of years.

<p/>Beyond Sicily came Greece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) definitely wanted to see Greece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wanted to see Greece as Dickie Greenleaf, with Dickie's money, Dickie's clothes, Dickie's way of behaving with strangers. But would it happen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) couldn't see Greece as Dickie Greenleaf? Would one thing after another happen to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) - murder, the police, people? He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) hadn't wanted to murder, it had been necessary. The idea of going to Greece, walking over the Acropolis as Tom Ripley, American tourist, held no charm for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) would rather not go. Tears came in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) stared up at the cathedral, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) turned away.

<p/>There was a fat letter from Marge the next morning. Tom squeezed it between his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fingers and smiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew what it said because it was so fat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) read it at breakfast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) enjoyed every line of it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) breakfast. It was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had hoped for and more.

<p/>...If you really didn't know that I had come by your hotel, that only means that Tom didn't tell you, which gives me my answer. It's pretty obvious now that you're running out and can't face me. Why don't you admit that you can't live without your little friend? I'm only sorry, old boy, that you didn't have the courage to tell me this before and directly. What do you think I am, a small-town fool who doesn't know about such things?

<p/>Success Number Two of my Roman holiday is informing the police that Tom Ripley is with you. They seemed in a desperate hurry to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>). -LRB-I wonder why? What's he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) done now?-RRB- I also informed the police in my best Italian that you and Tom are always together and that I could not imagine how they found you and missed Tom.

<p/>I'll be leaving for the States around the end of March. I'm not angry, Dickie boy I just thought you had more courage.

<p/>Thanks for all the wonderful memories. They're like something in a museum already. Best wishes for the future,

<p/>Marge



<p/>Five days passed, calm, lonely but very pleasant days in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wandered around Palermo, stopping here and there for an hour or two in a cafe or a restaurant and reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) travel books and the newspaper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) visited a palace, the Palermo library, with its paintings and papers in glass cases. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wrote letters to people in New York.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was lonely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had imagined himself making a bright new group of friends with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) would start a new life with new attitudes, standards, and habits that would be much better and clearer than the ones he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had had all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) life. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) realized that it couldn't be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) would have to keep a distance from people, always. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was alone, and it was a lonely game he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was playing. The friends he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) might make were most of the danger, of course. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had to wander around the world alone, well, there was much less chance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) would be found out. That was one cheerful side of it, anyway, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) felt better after he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had thought of it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) behavior slightly, to suit the role of an observer of life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was still polite and smiling to everyone, to people who wanted to borrow his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) newspaper in restaurants and to workers he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) spoke to in the hotel, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) head even higher and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) spoke a little less when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) spoke. There was a sadness about him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) enjoyed the change. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) imagined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) looked like a young man who had had an unhappy love affair or emotional disaster, and was trying to recover by visiting some of the more beautiful places on the earth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello! How are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) greeted the man behind the hotel desk with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A letter for you, sir. Very urgent,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man said, smiling, too.

<p/>It was from Dickie's bank in Naples. Inside the envelope was another envelope from Dickie's bank in New York. Tom read the letter from the Naples bank first.

<p/>Dear Sir:

<p/>It has been brought to our attention by the Wendell Trust Company of New York, that there exists a doubt whether your signature on your check of five hundred dollars of last January is your own. We are informing you as quickly as possible so that we can take the necessary action.

<p/>We have already decided that it is best to inform the police, but we shall wait for your reply. Any information you may be able to give us will be most appreciated, and we beg you to communicate with us as soon as possible.

<p/>Most respectfully,

<p/>Emilio di Braganzi Secretary General,

<p/>the Bank of Naples



<p/>P.S.. If the signature is in fact yours, we ask you to visit our office in Naples as soon as possible to sign your name again for our permanent records.

<p/>Tom tore open the letter from the New York bank.



<p/>February 5

<p/>Dear Mr. Greenleaf:

<p/>Our Department of Signatures has reported to us that in its opinion your signature of January on your regular monthly check, No. 8747, is not yours. We inform you so that you may let us know if you signed the check or inform us that the check has been stolen. We have brought this to the attention of the Bank of Naples also.

<p/>We are sending you a card for our permanent signature file which we request you to sign and return to us. Please let us hear from you as soon as possible.

<p/>Sincerely, Edward T. Cavanach Secretary



<p/>Tom wet his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would write to both banks that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not missing any money at all. But would that stop them for long? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had signed three checks, beginning in December. Were they going to go back and check on all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) signatures now? Would somebody be able to tell that all three signatures were not Dickie's?

<p/>Tom went upstairs and immediately sat down at the typewriter. Most false signatures took months to be discovered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought. Why had they noticed this one in four weeks? Wasn't it because they were checking on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in every department of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life, since the Freddie Miles murder and the San Remo boat story? They wanted to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) personally in the Naples bank. Maybe some of the men there knew Dickie by sight. A terrible fear ran over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) shoulders and down his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) legs. For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) felt weak, too weak to move. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) saw himself surrounded by a dozen policemen, Italian and American. They were asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) where Dickie Greenleaf was, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) was unable to produce Dickie Greenleaf or tell them where he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) was, or prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) existed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) imagined himself trying to sign <div class="bookquote">``H. Richard Greenleaf''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>under the eyes of a dozen witnesses, and falling apart suddenly and not being able to write at all.



<p/>February 12

<p/>Dear Sirs:

<p/>In reply to your letter concerning my January check:

<p/>I signed the check myself and received all of the money. If I had missed the check, I would of course have informed you at once.

<p/>I am returning the card with my signature for your permanent record as you requested.

<p/>Sincerely, H. Richard Greenleaf



<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) signed Dickie's signature several times on the back of the bank's envelope before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) signed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) letter and then the card.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wrote a similar letter to the Naples bank, and promised to go to the bank within the next few days and sign his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) name again for their permanent record. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) marked both envelopes <div class="bookquote">``Urgent,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and then mailed them.



<p/>Chapter eight

<p/>The Return of Tom Ripley.

<p/>83 Police Station Rome February 14

<p/>Dear Mr. Greenleaf:

<p/>You are urgently requested to come to Rome to answer some important questions concerning Thomas Ripley. Your presence would be most appreciated and would greatly speed up our work.

<p/>Failure to come to us within a week will cause us to take certain steps which will be annoying for us and for you.

<p/>Most respectfully yours Captain Enrico Farrara

<p/>So they were still looking for Tom. But maybe it meant that something had happened on the Miles case, too, Tom thought. The Italians didn't call in an American using words like these. In the last paragraph they were actually threatening him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). And, of course, they knew about the signature on the check by now.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stood with the letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand, looking around the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw himself in the mirror; the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mouth were turned down, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes were anxious and scared, and because the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked was the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) suddenly became twice as frightened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) folded the letter and pocketed it, then took it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pocket and tore it into pieces.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) began to pack rapidly. This was the end of Dickie Greenleaf, he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) hated becoming Thomas Ripley again, hated being nobody, hated putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) old set of habits again. Now people would look down on him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) and be bored with him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) put on an act for them. Tom Ripley always felt stupid and unable to do anything with himself except entertain people for minutes at a time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) hated going back to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) would hate putting on a dirty old suit of clothes, a suit of clothes that had not been very good even when it was new. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) tears fell on Dickie's blue and white shirt that lay on top in the suitcase. It had Dickie's initials on it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) began to count up the things of Dickie's that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) could still keep because they had no initials, or because no one would remember that they were Dickie's and not his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) own.

<p/>Tom paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bill at the hotel, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had to wait until the next day for a boat away from the island. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) reserved the boat ticket in the name of Greenleaf, thinking that this was the last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) would ever reserve a ticket in the name of Greenleaf, but that maybe it wouldn't be, either. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) couldn't give up the idea that the problem might go away. Just might. And for that reason it was senseless to give up hope. There was no point in being desperate, anyway, even as Tom Ripley. Tom Ripley had never really been desperate, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) had often looked it. Hadn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) learned something from these last months? If you wanted to be cheerful or sad, or hopeful, or thoughtful, or polite, you simply had to act those things.

<p/>A very cheerful thought came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) awoke on the last morning in Palermo: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) could leave all Dickie's clothes at the American Express in Venice under a different name and pick them up at some future time, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wanted to or had to, or else never pick them up at all. It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) feel much better to know that Dickie's good shirts, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) identification bracelet, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wrist- watch would be safely stored somewhere, instead of lying at the bottom of the ocean or in a trashcan in Sicily.

<p/>So, after removing the initials from Dickie's two suitcases, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) sent them, locked, from Naples to the American Express Company in Venice, together with two paintings he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had begun in Palermo. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) sent them in the name of Robert S. Fanshaw, to be stored until they were collected.

<p/>***

<p/>Tom took a train from Naples up through Rome, Florence, Bologna, and Verona, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got out and went by bus to the town of Trento about sixty kilometers away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't want to buy a car in a town as big as Verona, because the police might notice his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) name when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) obtained his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) license plates, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought. In Trento, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bought a used car for about eight hundred dollars. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bought it in the name of Thomas Ripley, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) passport read, and took a hotel room in that name to wait the twenty-four hours until his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) license plates would be ready. By noon the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) plates on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) car and nothing had happened. There was nothing in the papers about the search for Thomas Ripley. It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) feel rather strange, rather safe and happy; perhaps the whole situation was unreal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) began to feel happy even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) boring role as Thomas Ripley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) took a pleasure in it, almost overdoing the old Tom Ripley shyness with strangers. Would anyone, anyone, believe that such a person had ever committed a murder? And the only murder he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) could possibly be suspected of was Dickie's in San Remo, and the police didn't seem to be getting very far on that. Life as Tom Ripley had one positive, at least: it freed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) mind of guilt for the stupid, unnecessary murder of Freddie Miles.

<p/>The next night he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) spent in Venice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) found Venice much bigger than he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) had imagined. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) could walk across the whole city by the narrow streets and bridges without setting foot in a boat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) chose a hotel very near the Rialto bridge called the Costanza, a hotel which was neither famous nor a cheap one on the back streets. It was clean, inexpensive, and convenient to places of interest. It was just the hotel for Tom Ripley.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) spent a couple of hours in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) room, Tom imagined the conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was going to have with the police before long... Well, I haven't any idea. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in Rome. If you've any doubt of that, you can ask Miss Marjorie Sherwood... Of course I'm Tom Ripley! -LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) would give a laugh.-RRB- I can't understand what all the problem is about!... San Remo? Yes, I remember. We brought the boat back after an hour... Yes, I came back to Rome after Mongibello, but I didn't stay more than a couple of nights. I've been wandering around the north of Italy... I'm afraid I haven't any idea where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) is, but I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) about three weeks ago...

<p/>Tom got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) chair smiling, changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shirt and tie for the evening, and went out to find a pleasant restaurant for dinner. A good restaurant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought. Tom Ripley could order something expensive for once. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) pocket was so full of money that it wouldn't bend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) had cashed a thousand dollars' worth of travelers' checks in Dickie's name before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) left Palermo.

<p/>Tom entered a small, lighted street. It was full of restaurants, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) chose a very large and respectable-looking place with white tablecloths and brown wooden walls, the kind of restaurants which experience had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) by now concentrated on food and not appearance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took a table and opened one of the newspapers.

<p/>And there it was, a short article on the second page:

<p/>POLICE SEARCH FOR MISSING AMERICAN Dickie Greenleaf, Friend of the Murdered Freddie Miles, Missing After Sicilian Holiday

<p/>The article stated that H. Richard -LRB-Dickie-RRB- Greenleaf, a close friend of Frederick Miles, the American murdered three weeks ago in Rome, had disappeared after taking a boat from Palermo to Naples. Both the Sicilian and Roman police had been informed and were looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>). A final paragraph said that Greenleaf had just been requested by the Rome police to answer questions concerning the disappearance of Thomas Ripley, also a close friend of Greenleaf. Ripley had been missing for about three months, the paper said.

<p/>The next morning there was a long story in another newspaper, saying in only one small paragraph that Thomas Ripley was missing, but stating very boldly that Richard Greenleaf's absence was <div class="bookquote">``making the police suspect his (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) guilt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) should go immediately to the police to discuss the situation. The paper also mentioned the forged checks.

<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) walk around the city the next morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) had to identify himself, immediately. It would look worse for him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>), whatever happened, the longer he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) waited. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) left the cathedral, he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) inquired of a policeman where the nearest police station was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) asked it sadly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) felt sad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) wasn't afraid, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) felt that identifying himself as Thomas Phelps Ripley was going to be one of the saddest things he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had ever done in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are Thomas Ripley?''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>the captain of police asked, with no more interest than if Tom had been a dog that had been lost and was now found. <div class="bookquote">``May I see your passport?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom handed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what the trouble is, but when I saw in the papers that I am believed to be missing - ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was all sad and boring, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had expected. <div class="bookquote">``What happens now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom asked the officer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall telephone to Rome,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>the officer answered calmly, and picked up the telephone on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) desk.

<p/>There was a few minutes' wait for the Rome line, and then the officer announced to someone in Rome that the American, Thomas Ripley, was in Venice. Then the officer said to Tom, <div class="bookquote">``They would like to see you in Rome. Can you go to Rome today?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom frowned. <div class="bookquote">``I wasn't planning to go to Rome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall tell them,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>the officer said, and spoke into the telephone again.

<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was arranging for the Rome police to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>). There were still some advantages to being an American citizen, Tom supposed.

<p/>Tom spent the rest of the day in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) room, quietly thinking, reading, and making small changes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) appearance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought it quite possible that they would send the same man who had spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in Rome.

<p/>At eight-thirty that evening his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) telephone rang, and the man from the hotel desk announced that Lieutenant Roverini was downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you have him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) come up, please?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said.

<p/>Tom opened the door in a lazy way. <div class="bookquote">``Good evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good evening. Lieutenant Roverini from the Roman Police.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) came another tall, silent young police officer - not another, Tom realized suddenly, but the one who had been with the lieutenant when Tom had first met Roverini in the apartment in Rome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a friend of Mr. Richard Greenleaf?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lieutenant</b></font>)</div>the lieutenant asked, obviously not recognizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When did you last see him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) and where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) for a short time in Rome, just before he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) went to Sicily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did you hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) was in Sicily?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lieutenant</b></font>)</div><p/>The lieutenant was writing it all down in the notebook that he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) had taken from his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) brown case.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I didn't hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not know when you were in Rome that the police wanted to see you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I did not know that. I cannot understand why people think I am missing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Greenleaf did not tell you in Rome that the police wanted to speak to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Ripley, where have you been since the end of November?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been traveling. I have been mostly in the north of Italy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom made a mistake here and there, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Italian sounded quite different from Dickie's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Milan, Torino, Faenza.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have searched the hotels in Milan and Faenza. Did you stay all the time with friends? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I - slept quite often in my car.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was obvious he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't have much money, Tom thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I see your passport?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom pulled it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) inside jacket pocket. The lieutenant studied the picture closely, while Tom waited with the slightly anxious look, the firmly open lips, of the passport photograph. The lieutenant looked quickly at the few marks that only partly filled the first two pages of the passport.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been in Italy since October 2?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lieutenant</b></font>)</div><p/>The lieutenant smiled, a pleasant Italian smile now, and leaned forward. <div class="bookquote">``Well, that settles one important matter - the mystery of the San Remo boat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom frowned. <div class="bookquote">``What is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A boat was found sunk there with some stains that were believed to be blood. Naturally, when you were missing, or we thought you were missing, immediately after San Remo - We thought it might be a good idea to ask Mr. Greenleaf what had happened to you. We did that. The boat was missed the same day that you two were in San Remo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom pretended not to see the joke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you also know Frederick Miles?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lieutenant</b></font>)</div>the lieutenant asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I only met him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) once when he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was getting off the bus in Mongibello. I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah-hah.''  (<font color='red'><b>The lieutenant</b></font>)</div>The lieutenant was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have read in a newspaper that the police may believe that Mr. Greenleaf is guilty of the murder of Freddie Miles if he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) does not speak to them. Is it true that they think he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) is guilty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, no, no, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lieutenant</b></font>)</div>the lieutenant protested. <div class="bookquote">``But it is important that he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) comes forward! Why is he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) hiding himself? You have absolutely no idea where Mr. Greenleaf might be at this moment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, absolutely no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Greenleaf and Mr. Miles didn't have an argument that you know of? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, but - ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about the girl, Marjorie Sherwood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it is possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said, <div class="bookquote">``but I do not think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom waited, silent. The lieutenant was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to say something more. Tom felt quite comfortable now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt suddenly innocent and strong.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think they had an argument, Mr. Miles and Mr. Greenleaf, about Miss Sherwood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot say. It is possible. I know that Mr. Miles was very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sherwood</b></font>), too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dickie/Dickie Greenleaf/Greenleaf</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) story painted a picture of Dickie as an unhappy lover, Tom thought, not willing to let Marge go to Cortina to have some fun, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) liked Freddie Miles too much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think Dickie is running away from something, or do you think it is an accident that you cannot find him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no. This is too much. First, the matter of the checks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) denied the false signatures, but when the bank wishes to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) and also the police in Rome wish to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) about the murder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) friend, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) suddenly disappears -''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lieutenant</b></font>)</div><p/>The lieutenant threw out his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``That can only mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) is running away from us.''  (<font color='red'><b>The lieutenant</b></font>)</div>The lieutenant stood up. <div class="bookquote">``Well, thank you so much for your help, Mr. Ripley. I hope we can find you more easily the next time we have questions to ask you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you like I shall keep in touch with you in Rome so you will always know where I am. I am as much interested as you in finding my friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lieutenant</b></font>)</div><p/>The lieutenant handed him (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) a card with his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) name and the address of his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) station in Rome. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mr. Ripley. Good day.''  (<font color='red'><b>The policeman</b></font>)</div>The younger policeman waved to him (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) went out, and Tom said goodbye and quietly closed the door.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt like flying - like a bird, out of the window, with spread arms! The fools! All around the thing and never guessing it! Never guessing that Dickie was running from the signature questions because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wasn't Dickie Greenleaf at all!

<p/>Tonight he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) was going to have a wonderful dinner. And look out at the moonlight on the water. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) was suddenly very hungry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) was going to have something delicious and expensive to eat.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) had a bright idea while he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) was changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) clothes: he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) ought to have an envelope hidden in his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) suitcase, with a note on it saying that it should not be opened for several months. Inside it should be a will signed by Dickie, leaving Tom his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) money and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) income. That was an idea!



<p/>Chapter nine

<p/>A Visit from Marge.

<p/>Venice February 28

<p/>Dear Mr. Greenleaf:

<p/>I thought I ought to write you with whatever personal information I have about Richard, since I was one of the last people, it seems, who saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).

<p/>I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) in Rome around February 2 at the Inghilterra Hotel. As you know, this was only two or three days after the death of Freddie Miles. I found Dickie upset and nervous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was going to Palermo as soon as the police finished questioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) about Freddie's death, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) seemed eager to get away. I wanted to tell you that there was a certain unhappiness under all this that troubled me much more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) obvious nervousness. I had the feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) would try to do something violent - perhaps to himself.

<p/>I believe it is possible that Richard has killed himself. At the time of writing he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) has not been found. I certainly hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) will be before this reaches you. This is a sad message to send you and I regret it. I thought it my duty to write you this...



<p/>Munich March 3

<p/>Dear Tom

<p/>Thanks for your letter. It was very kind of you. I've answered the police in writing, and one came up to see me. I won't be coming by Venice, but thanks for your invitation. I am going to Rome the day after tomorrow to meet Dickie's father, who is flying over. Yes, I agree with you that it was a good idea for you to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>).

<p/>I did want to say to you that I don't agree with you at all that Dickie would commit suicide. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) just isn't the type. I know you're going to say people never act like they're going to do it. But no, not Dickie. Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was murdered in a back street in Naples - or even Rome. I can also imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) running out on duties. I think that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s doing now.

<p/>Nice to know your address finally. Thanks again for your letter, your advice, and invitations.

<p/>Best, Marge



<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) had decided to be friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>), Tom supposed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>)'d probably changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) attitude about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to the police, too.

<p/>Dickie's disappearance was causing a lot of interest in the Italian newspapers. Marge, or somebody, had provided reporters with photographs. There were pictures of Dickie sailing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) boat in Mongibello, pictures of Dickie on a beach, and a picture of Dickie and Marge. One of the articles mentioned that <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Ripley, one of the wealthy young American visitors in Italy, now lives in a palace looking out on San Marco in Venice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>That pleased Tom most of all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cut out and saved that article.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was now so confident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) even wrote Aunt Dottie with a calm, loving attitude that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had never wanted to use before, or had never before been able to use. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) asked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) health and her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) little group of nasty friends in Boston. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had finished the letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) typed Dickie's will, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) income and the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had in various banks, and signed it Richard Greenleaf. The signature was perfect, exactly like the thin, confusing signature on Dickie's passport. Tom practiced for half an hour before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) signed the will, relaxed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands, then signed a piece of paper, then the will, in rapid order. Tom put an envelope into the typewriter and addressed it to <div class="bookquote">``To Whom It May Concern,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>with a note that it shouldn't be opened until June of this year. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) placed it in a side pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) suitcase to suggest that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been carrying it there for some time and hadn't bothered unpacking it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) moved into the house.

<p/>***

<p/>About ten days after Marge's letter, Tom began to worry because Mr. Greenleaf hadn't written or telephoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) from Rome. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) sometimes imagined that the police had told Mr. Greenleaf that they were playing a game with Tom Ripley, and had asked Mr. Greenleaf not to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>).

<p/>Each day he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) looked eagerly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) mailbox for a letter from Marge or Mr. Greenleaf. His (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) house was ready for their arrival. His (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) answers to their questions were ready in his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) head. Tom wanted to take a trip, the famous trip to Greece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had bought a travel book about Greece, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had already planned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) journey through the islands, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't go until something happened.

<p/>Then, on the morning of April 4, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got a telephone call from Marge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was in Venice at the railroad station.

<p/>***

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll come and pick you up!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Greenleaf with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>)'s in Rome. I'm alone. You don't have to pick me up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said, wanting something to do at last. <div class="bookquote">``You'll never find the house by yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will. It's next to della Salute, isn't it? I take a boat from San Marco's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was right. <div class="bookquote">``Well, if you really want to come alone.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had just thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had better take one more good look around the house before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) got there.<div class="bookquote">'' Have you had lunch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! We'll lunch together somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They hung up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walked seriously and slowly through the house, into both large rooms upstairs, down the stairs, and through the living room. Nothing, anywhere, that belonged to Dickie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) hoped the house didn't look too upper class.

<p/>Tom made two drinks and arranged the glasses and a plate of snacks on a small table in the living room. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heard a knock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went to the door and swung it open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marge! Good to see you! Come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took the suitcase from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you, Tom? Is all this yours?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked around her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and up at the high ceiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I rented it very cheaply,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said quickly <div class="bookquote">``Come and have a drink. Tell me what's new. You've been talking to the police in Rome?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) overcoat and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) raincoat to a chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and to Mr. Greenleaf. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>)'s very upset - naturally.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sat down on a sofa.

<p/>Tom sat opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Have they found anything new? One of the officers there has been keeping me informed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) hasn't told me anything that really matters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, they found out that Dickie cashed over a thousand dollars' worth of travelers' checks before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) left Palermo, just before. Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) went somewhere with it, like Greece or Africa. Certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) didn't go off to kill himself after just cashing a thousand dollars, anyway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom agreed. <div class="bookquote">``Well, that sounds hopeful. I didn't see that in the papers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think they put it in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How is Mr. Greenleaf?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Marge shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I feel so sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) keeps saying the American police could do a better job and all that, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) doesn't know any Italian, so that makes it twice as bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) doing in Rome?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Waiting. What can any of us do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) drink slowly while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``I certainly didn't mean to upset anybody when I said what I did about Dickie's sadness. I felt it was kind of a duty to tell you and Mr. Greenleaf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand. No, I think you were right to tell us. I just don't think it's true.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) smiled, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) eyes shining with a belief that struck Tom as completely crazy.

<p/>During lunch, Marge asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) more questions than any police officer about Dickie's feelings while he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was in Rome. Tom was questioned about everything from Di Massimo, the painter Dickie had worked with, to Dickie's eating habits and the hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) got up in the morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) felt about me? Tell me honestly. I can take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) was worried about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said seriously. <div class="bookquote">``I think - well, it was one of those situations that happen quite often, a man who's afraid of marriage to begin with-''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I never asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to marry me! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>Marge protested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, but -''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom forced himself to continue, though the subject was sour in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mouth. <div class="bookquote">``Let's say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't face the responsibility of you caring so much about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted a less complicated relationship with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) everything and nothing.

<p/>They were silent a few minutes, then Tom asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) life and work. Marge answered very enthusiastically. Tom had the feeling that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) had Dickie back she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) would probably just explode with happiness, make a loud, attractive pop! And that would be the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think I should offer to talk to Mr. Greenleaf, too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom asked. <div class="bookquote">``I'd be glad to go to Rome -''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wouldn't be so glad, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) remembered, because Rome had simply too many people in it who had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as Dickie Greenleaf. <div class="bookquote">``Or do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>)'d like to come here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it'd be nice if you called him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>). I'll write the address down for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a good idea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) doesn't like me, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>Marge smiled a little. <div class="bookquote">``Well, to be honest, no. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) thinks you used Dickie, to your advantage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I didn't. I'm sorry the idea didn't work about my getting Dickie back home, but I explained all of that. I wrote him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) the nicest letter I could about Dickie when I heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was missing. Didn't that help? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it did, but - Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Tom! All over this wonderful tablecloth!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>Marge had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) drink over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) wiped at the tablecloth rapidly.

<p/>Tom came running back from the kitchen with a wet cloth. <div class="bookquote">``Perfectly all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, watching the wood of the table turn white in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wiping. It wasn't the tablecloth he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cared about, it was the beautiful table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>Marge went on protesting.

<p/>Tom hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) suddenly remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) bra hanging over the window in Mongibello. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) underwear would be hanging over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) chairs tonight, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) to stay here. The idea disgusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) forced himself to smile across the table at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I hope you'll honor me by accepting a bed for the night. Not mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``but I've got two rooms upstairs and you're welcome to one of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks a lot. All right, I will.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) smiled broadly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/>Tom called Mr. Greenleaf from a public telephone at about seven o'clock. Mr. Greenleaf sounded friendlier than Tom had expected, and sadly hungry for any information about Dickie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've told Marge all I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said, <div class="bookquote">``so she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>)'ll be able to tell you anything I've forgotten. I'm only sorry that I can't provide anything of real importance for the police to work on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These police!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf said angrily. <div class="bookquote">``I'm beginning to think Richard is dead. For some reason the Italians don't want to admit he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) might be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom was shocked at Mr. Greenleaf's honesty about Dickie's possible death.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you really think Dickie's killed himself, Mr. Greenleaf?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom asked quietly.

<p/>Mr. Greenleaf thought about it for a minute. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I think it's possible, yes. I never thought much of my son's mental health, Tom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I agree with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said. <div class="bookquote">``Would you like to talk to Marge? She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>)'s here with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, thanks. When's she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) coming back? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>)'d be going back to Rome tomorrow. If you'd like to come to Venice, just for a slight rest, Mr. Greenleaf, you're welcome to stay at my house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mr. Greenleaf refused the invitation.

<p/>Tom and Marge walked to a restaurant. Marge was in the mood to talk and that annoyed Tom through their long dinner, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) made an enormous effort not to get angry. The worst was coming later tonight, Tom thought: the boat ride.

<p/>Marge wanted a private boat, of course, not the regular service that took people over from San Marco's to the steps of Santa Maria della Salute. It was one-thirty in the morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) felt exhausted and lay back in the boat's seat as lazily as Marge, careful to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) leg from touching hers.



<p/>Chapter ten

<p/>The Arrival of Mr. Greenleaf.

<p/>Tom was awakened very early the next morning by a banging on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) grabbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pants and went down. It was a telegram, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had to run back upstairs to get a tip for the man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stood in the cold living room and read it: CHANGED MY MIND. WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU. ARRIVING 11:45 A.M. H. GREENLEAF.

<p/>Tom shook with fear. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had expected it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hadn't really. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wasn't looking forward to it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ran upstairs and got back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) warm bed to try to catch some more sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) kept wondering if Marge would come in or knock on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) door because she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) had heard that loud knock, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) finally decided that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) had slept through it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) imagined greeting Mr. Greenleaf at the door, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) hand firmly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) tried to imagine his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) questions, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) mind was too tired and that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) feel frightened and uncomfortable.

<p/>Marge and Tom went to the railroad station to meet Mr. Greenleaf at eleven forty-five. It was raining, and so windy and cold that the rain felt like ice on their faces. Finally there was Mr. Greenleaf, serious and gray. Marge rushed forward to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) on the cheek, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) said loudly, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``How're you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, sir. And you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom suggested they go straight to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) house, but Mr. Greenleaf wanted to go to a hotel first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll come over as soon as I check in. I thought I'd try the Gritti. Is that anywhere near your place? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not too close, but you can walk to San Marco's and take a boat over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said. <div class="bookquote">``We'll come with you, if you want, if you just want to check in. I thought we could all have lunch together - unless you'd rather see Marge by yourself first.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was the old Ripley again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Came here mainly to talk to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there any news?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>Marge asked.

<p/>Mr. Greenleaf shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) was looking around nervously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) hadn't answered Tom's question about lunch. Tom folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arms, put a pleasant look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face, and didn't try to talk any more. Mr. Greenleaf and Marge were talking very quietly about some people they knew in Rome. Tom observed that Marge and Mr. Greenleaf were very friendly, though Marge had said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) had not known him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) in Rome.

<p/>At lunch, Mr. Greenleaf talked a little more, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) face kept its serious look, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) still looked around as he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) spoke, clearly hoping that Dickie would come walking in at any moment. The police hadn't found anything that could be called a clue, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had just arranged for an American private detective to come over and try to solve the mystery.

<p/>This made Tom swallow thoughtfully - he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), too, believed that American detectives were better than the Italians.

<p/>The questions, Tom thought, would come at the house, probably when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and Mr. Greenleaf were alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) knew Mr. Greenleaf wanted to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) alone, and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) suggested coffee at the restaurant where they were before Marge could suggest having it at home. But Marge sat around with them in the living room for half an hour after they got back. Finally Tom frowned at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) and looked at the stairs and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) got the message, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) hand over her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) mouth, and announced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was going up to have a short rest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf began heavily, <div class="bookquote">'' this is a strange end, isn't it? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``End?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you living in Europe now, and Richard - ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None of us has suggested yet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) might be back in America,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said pleasantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. That couldn't be. The officials in America have been watching for him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf continued to walk, not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Where do you really think he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) may be? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) could be hiding in Italy - very easily, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) doesn't use a hotel where he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) has to sign in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are there any hotels in Italy where one doesn't have to sign in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not officially. But anyone who knows Italian as well as Dickie might manage it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is that your idea of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) may be doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) suddenly, and Tom saw that sad expression he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had noticed on the first evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I - It's possible. That's all I can say about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) paused. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry to say it, Mr. Greenleaf, but I think there's a real possibility that Dickie is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Greenleaf's look didn't change. <div class="bookquote">``Because of that sadness you mentioned in Rome? What exactly did he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) say to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) general mood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said. <div class="bookquote">``The Miles thing had obviously upset him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)'s the sort of man - He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) really does hate attention of any kind, violence of any kind.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) did say that if one more thing happened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) would just go crazy - or he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) didn't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) would do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I don't agree with you that Richard committed suicide,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, neither does Marge. I just said it's a possibility. I don't even think it's the most likely thing that's happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't? What do you think is? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)'s hiding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said. <div class="bookquote">``You know he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) could be in several other countries besides Italy, too. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) went to Greece or France or anywhere else after he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) got back to Naples, because no one was looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) until days later.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf said tiredly.

<p/>Later that evening, Tom and Marge called Mr. Greenleaf at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hotel. It was still early for dinner, so they had drinks at a cafe in a street near Mr. Greenleaf's hotel. Tom tried hard to be pleasant and to talk in a friendly manner during dinner. Mr. Greenleaf was in a good mood, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) had just telephoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) wife and found her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in very good spirits and feeling much better.

<p/>It was a quiet dinner. Tom told a clean, slightly funny joke, and Marge laughed loudly. Mr. Greenleaf refused to let Tom pay for the dinner, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was going back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hotel because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't feel too good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was going back to Rome tomorrow, and Marge decided to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). They walked back to the hotel and said goodnight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry I wasn't able to spend more time with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I, my boy. Maybe some other time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/>Tom walked back home with Marge in a kind of fog of happiness. It had all gone very well, Tom thought. Marge talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as they walked, laughing because she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) had broken her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) bra and had to hold it up with one hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) said.

<p/>Tom was thinking of the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had received from Bob Delancey this afternoon, the first letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had received from Bob in many weeks. Tom had lived in a room in Bob's house before leaving New York. In the letter, Bob said that the police had questioned everybody in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) house about an income tax crime of a few months ago. The criminal, it seemed, had used Bob's address to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) checks, and had gotten the checks by the simple means of taking the letters out of the mailbox, where the mailman had put them. The mailman had been questioned, too, Bob had said, and remembered the name George McAlpin on the letters. Bob seemed to think it was rather funny. The mystery was, who took the letters addressed to George McAlpin?

<p/>It was a very comforting letter for Tom. That income tax situation had been worrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had known the police would find out about it at some time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was glad the wait had ended. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't imagine how the police would ever, could ever, connect Tom Ripley with George McAlpin.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>McAlpin</b></font>) sat down in the living room to read Bob's letter again when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) got home. Marge had gone upstairs to pack her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) things and to go to bed. Tom was tired, too, but the freedom of tomorrow, when Marge and Mr. Greenleaf would be gone, was a pleasant thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoes off so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feet up on the sofa, lay back on a pillow, and continued reading Bob's letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The police think it's somebody who came by occasionally to pick up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mail, because none of the people in this house look like criminals... How are the girls in Venice? How long are you staying there anyway?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Forever, Tom thought. Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d never go back to the States. It wasn't really Europe itself that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feel this way, but the evenings he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had spent alone, here and in Rome. Evenings by himself simply looking at maps, or lying around on sofas going through travel books. Evenings looking at the clothes - his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) clothes and Dickie's - and feeling Dickie's rings, and running his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) fingers over the suitcase he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had bought at Gucci's.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) loved objects, not mountains of them, but a certain few that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wanted to keep. They gave a man respect for himself. The things he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) possessed reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) existed, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) life. It was as simple as that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) existed. Dickie's money gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) the opportunity to see Greece, to collect whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wanted, to join art societies if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) cared to, and to give money to their work.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) might rest, then read some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) book, whatever the hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) felt warm and sleepy, in spite of the coffee he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had drunk. The edge of the sofa fitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) shoulders like somebody's arm, or better than somebody's arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) decided he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) would spend the night here. It was more comfortable than the sofa upstairs. In a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) might go up and get a blanket.



<p/>Chapter eleven

<p/>Dickie's Rings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) eyes. Marge was coming down the stairs. Tom sat up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brown leather box in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I just found Dickie's rings in here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) said as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was having trouble breathing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) gave them to me. To take care of.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom stood up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In Rome, I think.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took a step back and picked up one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoes, mostly in an effort to seem calm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) going to do? Why'd he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) give them to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>)'d been looking for a needle to sew her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) bra, Tom thought. Why hadn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) put the rings somewhere else, like in an inside pocket of that suitcase? <div class="bookquote">``I don't really know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said. <div class="bookquote">``A moment of stupidity or something. You know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) said if anything ever happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wanted me to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) rings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Marge looked confused. <div class="bookquote">``Where was he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) going? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Palermo.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was holding the shoe in both hands, in a position to use it as a weapon. A plan went quickly through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head: hit her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) with the shoe, then drag her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) out by the front door, and drop her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) into the water. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d say shed fallen, slipped on the rocks. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was such a good swimmer, he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>)'d thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) could save herself.

<p/>Marge stared down at the box. <div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was going to kill himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes - if you want to look at it that way, the rings - They make it look more likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you say anything about it before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I absolutely forgot them. I put them away so they wouldn't get lost and I never thought of looking at them since the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) gave them to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) either killed himself or changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) identity - didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said it sadly and firmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better tell Mr. Greenleaf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will. Mr. Greenleaf and the police.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we're getting closer to the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>Marge said.

<p/>Tom was twisting the shoe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands like a pair of gloves now, but still keeping it in position, because Marge was staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in a funny way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was still thinking. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) playing games with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)? Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) know now?

<p/>Marge said seriously, <div class="bookquote">``I just can't imagine Dickie ever being without his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) rings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>and Tom knew then that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) hadn't guessed the answer.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) relaxed and sank down on the sofa and pretended to busy himself with putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) agreed, automatically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it weren't so late, I'd call Mr. Greenleaf now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>)'s probably in bed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) wouldn't sleep all night if I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>), I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry I didn't mention it sooner,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It was just one of those - ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it makes it kind of silly at this point for Mr. Greenleaf to bring a private detective over, doesn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) voice shook.

<p/>Tom looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was going to cry. This was the first moment, Tom realized, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was admitting to herself that Dickie could be dead, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) probably was dead. Tom went toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) slowly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, Marge. I'm really sorry that I didn't tell you sooner about the rings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arm around her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) almost had to, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was leaning against him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/>***

<p/>Marge called Mr. Greenleaf at eight-thirty the next morning to ask how soon they could come over to his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) hotel. But Mr. Greenleaf probably noticed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was upset. Tom heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) starting to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) the story of the rings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) used the same words that Tom had used to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) about the rings - obviously Marge had believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) - but Tom couldn't tell what Mr. Greenleaf's reaction was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom asked when Marge had hung up.

<p/>Marge sat down tiredly on a chair across the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) seems to feel the way I do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) said it himself. It seems that Dickie meant to kill himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom sat up on the edge of the sofa and loosened his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had slept in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) clothes on the sofa, and Marge had awakened him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) had come down a few minutes ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt awful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stood up suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going upstairs to wash,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) called to Marge.

<p/>Tom undressed in the room next to Marge's, then went into the bathroom and turned on the shower. After a look at himself in the mirror he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) decided to shave first, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went back to the room to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) electric razor which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had removed from the bathroom for no particular reason when Marge had arrived. On the way back he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heard the telephone ring. Marge answered it. Tom leaned over the stairs, listening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, that doesn't matter if we don't... Yes, I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>)... All right, we'll hurry. Tom's just washing up... Oh, less than an hour. Bye-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) walking toward the stairs, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stepped back because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wasn't dressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) called up. <div class="bookquote">``The detective from America just got here! He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) just called Mr. Greenleaf and he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>)'s coming from the airport!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fine!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom called back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turned the shower off, and picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) razor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would be glad when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was gone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) left this morning. Unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) and Mr. Greenleaf decided to see what the detective was going to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>). Tom knew that the detective had come to Venice especially to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hadn't, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would have waited to see Mr. Greenleaf in Rome. Tom wondered if Marge realized that too. Probably she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) didn't.

<p/>Tom and Marge took the boat to San Marco and then walked to Mr. Greenleaf's hotel. They telephoned up to Mr. Greenleaf's room. Mr. Greenleaf said that Mr. McCarron was there, and asked them to come up.

<p/>Mr. Greenleaf opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) door for them. <div class="bookquote">``Good morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) pressed Marge's arm like a father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom came in behind Marge. The detective was standing by the window, a short, fat man of about thirty-five. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face looked friendly but serious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Alvin McCarron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf said. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Sherwood and Mr. Ripley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand you're a friend of Richard's?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We both are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you have the rings?''  (<font color='red'><b>McCarron/Mr. McCarron</b></font>)</div>McCarron asked, looking from Tom to Marge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>Marge said seriously, getting up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) took the rings from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) purse and gave them to McCarron.

<p/>McCarron turned to Tom. <div class="bookquote">``When did he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) give them to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In Rome. As close as I can remember, around February 3, just a few days after the murder of Freddie Miles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) say when he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) gave them to you? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) said that if anything happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) wanted me to have them. I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) thought was going to happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) didn't know, but something might.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom paused on purpose. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) didn't seem more upset at that particular moment than a lot of other times. I'd talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>), so it didn't enter my mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was going to kill himself. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) planned to go away, that was all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>the detective</b></font>)</div>asked the detective.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To Palermo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked at Marge. <div class="bookquote">``I'm quite certain he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) gave them to me the day you spoke to me in Rome - at the Inghilterra. That day or the day before. Do you remember the date?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``February 2,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>Marge said in a quiet voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What else?''  (<font color='red'><b>McCarron/Mr. McCarron</b></font>)</div>McCarron asked Tom. <div class="bookquote">``What time of day was it? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) been drinking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) drinks very little. I think it was early afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) said it would be better if I didn't mention the rings to anybody, and of course I agreed. I put the rings away and completely forgot about them, as I told Miss Sherwood - I suppose because I'd told myself so strongly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) didn't want me to say anything about them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you do with the rings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I put them in an old box that I have - just a little box I keep odd buttons in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>McCarron/Mr. McCarron</b></font>)</div><p/>McCarron looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>McCarron</b></font>) for a moment in silence. Out of that calm but bright Irish face could come anything, a difficult question, a direct statement that he (<font color='blue'><b>McCarron</b></font>) was lying. In his (<font color='blue'><b>McCarron</b></font>) mind, Tom concentrated on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own facts, determined to defend them to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) death. In the silence, Tom could hear Marge's breathing, and a cough from Mr. Greenleaf almost made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) jump. Mr. Greenleaf looked very calm, almost bored. Tom wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had fixed up some plan with McCarron against him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), based on the rings story?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) have any enemies that you know of?''  (<font color='red'><b>McCarron/Mr. McCarron</b></font>)</div>McCarron asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Absolutely none,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said. <div class="bookquote">``I've thought of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any reason you can think of why he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) might want to hide, or take another identity?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom said carefully, <div class="bookquote">``Possibly - but it's almost impossible in Europe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)'d need a different passport. Any country he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) wanted to enter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) would have to have a passport. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)'d need one even to get into a hotel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how do you see it, Mr. Ripley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>McCarron/Mr. McCarron</b></font>)</div><p/>McCarron wasn't nearly finished, Tom thought. McCarron was going to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) alone later. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I agree with Miss Sherwood that it appears that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>)'s killed himself. I've said that before to Mr. Greenleaf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When was the last time you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>), Miss Sherwood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On November 23, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) left for San Remo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>Marge said quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were then in Mongibello?''  (<font color='red'><b>McCarron/Mr. McCarron</b></font>)</div>McCarron asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Marge Sherwood</b></font>)</div>Marge said. <div class="bookquote">``I just missed seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) in Rome in February, but the last time I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) was in Mongibello.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) was trying to avoid everyone in Rome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom added. <div class="bookquote">``That's why, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) first gave me the rings, I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) had some idea of getting away from everyone he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) had known, living in another city, and just being alone for a time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, do you think? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom explained, mentioning the murder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friend Freddie Miles and its effect on Dickie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think Richard knew who killed Freddie Miles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I certainly don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>McCarron/Mr. McCarron</b></font>)</div>McCarron said to Tom. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think that might explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) behavior? Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)'s avoiding answering the police by hiding out now? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom thought for a minute. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) didn't give me a single reason to think that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think Dickie was afraid of something? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't imagine of what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said.

<p/>McCarron was staring at Tom, but whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was considering his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) honesty or thinking over all they had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), Tom couldn't tell. McCarron looked like a typical salesman, Tom thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't think too much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), but, on the other hand, it wasn't wise to ignore your enemy. McCarron's small, soft mouth opened as Tom watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Would you mind coming downstairs with me, Mr. Ripley, if you've still got a few minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said, standing up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We won't be long,''  (<font color='red'><b>McCarron/Mr. McCarron</b></font>)</div>McCarron said to Mr. Greenleaf and Marge.

<p/>They walked toward the elevator. Was this the way they did it? Tom wondered. A quiet word alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would be handed over to the Italian police, and then Mr. McCarron would return to the room just as he (<font color='blue'><b>McCarron</b></font>) had promised. Tom turned to McCarron as the elevator stopped, and said seriously, showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) teeth in a smile, <div class="bookquote">'' Is this your first trip to Venice? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>McCarron/Mr. McCarron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>McCarron/Mr. McCarron</b></font>)</div>said McCarron. He (<font color='blue'><b>McCarron</b></font>) passed by the hotel desk. <div class="bookquote">``Shall we go right in here?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>McCarron</b></font>) pointed at the coffee bar. He (<font color='blue'><b>McCarron</b></font>) spoke very politely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom agreed. Would McCarron accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>McCarron</b></font>) in a place like this, quietly laying down fact after fact on the table? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took the chair that McCarron pulled out for him (<font color='blue'><b>McCarron</b></font>). McCarron sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>McCarron</b></font>) back to the wall.

<p/>McCarron looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>McCarron</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>McCarron</b></font>) small mouth smiled on one side. Tom imagined three or four different beginnings: <div class="bookquote">``You killed Richard, didn't you? The rings are just too much, aren't they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Or <div class="bookquote">``Tell me about the San Remo boat, Mr. Ripley, in detail.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Or simply leading up quietly, <div class="bookquote">``Where were you on February 15, when Richard landed in... Naples? All right, but where were you living then? Where were you living in January, for example?... Can you prove it? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>McCarron/Mr. McCarron</b></font>)</div><p/>McCarron was saying nothing at all, only looking down at his (<font color='blue'><b>McCarron</b></font>) fat hands now, and smiling weakly.

<p/>Tom heard himself speaking, in an amazingly calm voice. <div class="bookquote">``Did you have time to speak to Lieutenant Roverini when you came through Rome?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) asked it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wanted information: to find out if McCarron had heard about the San Remo boat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I didn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>McCarron/Mr. McCarron</b></font>)</div>McCarron said. <div class="bookquote">``How would you describe Richard's character?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) wanted to be a painter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom began, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)'d never be a very good painter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) tried to pretend he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) didn't care, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was perfectly happy and leading exactly the kind of life he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) wanted to lead over here in Europe.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom wet his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``But I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was beginning to get depressed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) father didn't like his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) lifestyle, as you probably know. And Dickie had gotten himself into a difficult situation with Marge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marge was in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wasn't with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>), and at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) so much in Mongibello, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) kept on hoping -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom began to feel on safer ground, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pretended to have difficulty in expressing himself. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) never actually discussed it with me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) always spoke very highly of Marge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>), but it was obvious to everybody - Marge, too - that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) would never marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>). But Marge never quite gave up. I think that's the main reason Dickie left Mongibello.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean never gave up? What did she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) kept writing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>), wanting to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wanted to be by himself. Particularly after the Miles murder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) wasn't in the mood to see Marge, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>)'d come up to Rome from Mongibello when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) heard of all the trouble he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was nervous after the Miles murder? Do you think Richard killed Freddie? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't. I never thought of it. I don't know what kind of people are likely to kill somebody. I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) angry - ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom described the two days in Rome when Dickie, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, had been angry and frustrated because of the police questioning, and had actually moved out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) apartment to avoid phone calls from friends and strangers. Tom also talked again about the growing frustration in Dickie, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had not been progressing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had wanted to in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) painting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) described Dickie as a proud young man who was determined to ignore his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) father's wishes. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) killed himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said, <div class="bookquote">``I think it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) realized certain failures in himself. It's much easier for me to imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) as a suicide than a murderer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'm not so sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) didn't kill Freddie Miles. Are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>McCarron/Mr. McCarron</b></font>)</div><p/>McCarron was perfectly sincere. Tom was sure of that. McCarron was even expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to defend Dickie now, because they had been friends. Tom felt some of the terror leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), but only some of it, like something melting very slowly inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said, <div class="bookquote">``but I just don't believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure either. But it would explain a lot, wouldn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said. <div class="bookquote">``Everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>McCarron/Mr. McCarron</b></font>)</div><p/>***

<p/>McCarron called the next day from Rome, wanting the names of everyone Dickie had known in Mongibello. Most of the names Marge had already given him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>), but Tom went through them all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I guess that's about all. Thanks very much, Mr. Ripley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're very welcome. Good luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Tom waited quietly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) house for several days, just as anybody would do if the search for a missing friend had reached its most serious point.

<p/>On the evening of the sixth day after Mr. Greenleaf and McCarron had left, Tom called Mr. Greenleaf in Rome. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had nothing new to report, but Tom hadn't expected anything. Marge had gone back to the United States.

<p/>Mr. Greenleaf said he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) would be leaving at the end of the week, travelling first to Paris, where the French police were also carrying on the search. McCarron was going with him (<font color='blue'><b>McCarron</b></font>), and if nothing happened in Paris they were both going home. <div class="bookquote">``It's obvious to me or to anybody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Greenleaf said, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>)'s either dead or hiding from us. There's not a corner of the world where the search for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) hasn't been written about in the newspapers.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Greenleaf/Richard/Richard Greenleaf</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter twelve

<p/>Tom Ripley's Heroic Journey.

<p/>Venice June 3

<p/>Dear Mr. Greenleaf:

<p/>While packing a suitcase today, I found an envelope that Richard gave me in Rome, and which for some reason I had forgotten until now. On the envelope is written, <div class="bookquote">``Not to be opened until June''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and, as it happens, it is June. The envelope contains Richard's will, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) income and everything else to me. I am shocked by this, as you probably are, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) seemed to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was writing.

<p/>I am only very sorry I did not remember having the envelope. If I had, it would have proven much earlier that Dickie planned to kill himself. I put it into a suitcase pocket, and then I forgot it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) gave it to me on the last occasion I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>), in Rome, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was so depressed.

<p/>On second thoughts, I am sending a copy of the will so that you may see it for yourself. This is the first will I have ever seen in my life, and I don't know what happens. What should I do?

<p/>Please give my kindest hello to Mrs. Greenleaf and realize that I feel deeply for you both, and regret the need to write this letter. Please let me hear from you as soon as possible. My next address will be: c/o American Express, Athens, Greece.

<p/>Most sincerely yours, Tom Ripley



<p/>In a way it was asking for trouble, Tom thought. It might make people think again about the signatures, on the will and on the checks. But that was the mood he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had bought his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ticket for Greece in the middle of May, and the days had grown finer and finer, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) more and more anxious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had only two thousand dollars in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own name, moved from Dickie's bank and saved out of Dickie's income.

<p/>The risk of trying to get all of Dickie's money, the danger of it, was exciting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) was so bored after the quiet weeks in Venice when each day that went by seemed to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) of the dullness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) life. Roverini had stopped writing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>). Alvin McCarron had gone back to America, and Tom supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and Mr. Greenleaf had decided that further search was useless.

<p/>Tom had decided in Venice to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) journey to Greece a heroic one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would see the islands, swimming for the first time into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) view, as a living, breathing, brave individual - not as a frightened little nobody from Boston. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sailed right into the arms of the police in Greece, at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would first experience standing in the wind at the front of a ship, crossing the dark sea like an ancient hero.

<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) had written the letter to Mr. Greenleaf and mailed it three days before sailing from Venice. Mr. Greenleaf would probably not get the letter for four or five days, so there would be no time for Mr. Greenleaf to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) in Venice with a message and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) miss his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) ship. Besides, it looked better if he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) was calm about the matter, unable to receive messages for another week or two until he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) got to Greece. It was better to pretend he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) didn't care whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) got the money or not; he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) hadn't let the fact of the will delay even a little a trip he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) had planned to make.

<p/>Two days before he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) sailed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) went to tea at the house of a woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) had met the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) had started looking for a house in Venice. The woman, Titi, greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Titi</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Ah, hello, Thomas! Have you seen the afternoon paper? They have found Dickie's suitcases and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) paintings! Right here in the American Express in Venice!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gold earrings shook with excitement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom hadn't seen the papers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been too busy packing that afternoon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read it! Here! All his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) clothes, left there only in February! They were sent from Naples. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) is here in Venice!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom was reading it. The string around the paintings had fallen off, the paper said, and while wrapping them again a worker had discovered the signature of R. Greenleaf on the paintings. Tom's hands began to shake, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had to hold the sides of the paper to calm himself. The paper said that the police were now examining everything carefully for fingerprints.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) is alive!''  (<font color='red'><b>Titi</b></font>)</div>Titi shouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think - I don't see why this proves he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) is alive. Perhaps somebody killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) or he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) killed himself after he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) sent the suitcases. The fact that the paintings are under another name - Fanshaw - ''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Titi</b></font>) had the feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Titi</b></font>) friend, who was sitting on the sofa staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Titi</b></font>), was surprised by his (<font color='blue'><b>Titi</b></font>) nervousness, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Titi</b></font>) calmed himself down quickly and said, <div class="bookquote">``You see? They're looking through everything for clues. They wouldn't be doing that if they were sure Dickie had sent the suitcases himself. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) leave them in the name of Fanshaw, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) expected to pick them up again himself? His (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) passport's even here, it says. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) packed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) passport.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) is hiding himself under the name of Fanshaw! Oh, my dear, you need some tea! ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It says here that the suitcases contained everything - razor, toothbrush, shoes, overcoat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said, hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) terror in sadness. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) couldn't be alive and leave all that. The murderer probably took everything from his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) body and left his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) clothes there because it was the easiest way of getting rid of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you not be so sad until you know what the fingerprints are? You are supposed to go on a pleasure trip tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div><p/>The day after tomorrow, Tom thought. Plenty of time for Roverini to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fingerprints and compare them with the prints on the paintings and in the suitcases.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tried to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thoughts to Greece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw handsome buildings and blue skies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't want to go to Greece with the worry about the fingerprints in Venice hanging over him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). Tom put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands and cried. Greece was finished, exploded like a golden ball.

<p/>The worst of all was that Roverini, whose messages had been so friendly until now, sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) no information at all about the discovery of the suitcases. Tom didn't sleep that night and then spent a day walking around his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) house while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tried to finish the endless little duties before leaving for Greece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) expected the police to come knocking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) door at any time of the day or night.

<p/>***

<p/>By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got onto the ship for Greece, Tom felt like a walking ghost. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was sleepless, foodless, full of coffee, carried along only by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) nerves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) remembered last night lying face down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bed with one arm twisted beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and being too tired to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) position. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) awoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt better except that the arm he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been lying on hung uselessly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) side.

<p/>An angry courage rose in him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). What would happen if the radioman was receiving at this minute a message to arrest Tom Ripley? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) would stand up just as bravely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) was standing now. Or he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) might throw himself into the sea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) wasn't afraid. This was it. This was the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) had hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) would feel, sailing to Greece. To look out at the black water all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) and not be afraid was almost as good as seeing the islands of Greece coming into view.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) had been lucky beyond reason in escaping arrest for two murders, lucky from the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) had taken Dickie's identity until now. The first part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) life had been completely unfair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripley</b></font>) thought, but the period with Dickie and afterwards was like a wonderful dream. But something was going to happen now in Greece, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) felt, and it couldn't be good. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) luck had held for too long.

<p/>The only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) regretted was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had not seen all the world yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wanted to see Australia. And India. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) wanted to see Japan. Then there was South America. Just to look at the art of those countries would be a pleasant, rewarding life's work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had learned a lot about painting, even while trying to copy Dickie's bad paintings. At the art museums in Rome, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had discovered an interest in paintings that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) had never realized before, or perhaps that had not been in him (<font color='blue'><b>Dickie</b></font>) before.

<p/>When the boat approached Greece, Tom was standing looking at the land. It wasn't a dream ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), it was a solid hill that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could walk on, with buildings that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could touch - if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got that far.

<p/>The police were waiting on the dock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw four of them, standing with folded arms, looking up at the ship. Tom turned and walked slowly toward the policemen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wouldn't cause trouble, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d just tell them himself who he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was. There was a big newsstand behind the policemen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought of buying a paper. Perhaps they would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). The policemen stared back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) from over their folded arms as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) approached them. They wore black uniforms with caps. Tom smiled at them weakly. One of them touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cap and stepped to one side. The others didn't move closer. Now Tom was almost between two of them, right in front of the newsstand, and the policemen were staring forward again, paying no attention to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) at all.

<p/>Tom bought several newspapers and walked back to the dock to wait for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) luggage. Under the R's he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stopped and opened the oldest Italian paper, which was four days old.

<p/>NO ONE NAMED ROBERT S. FANSHAW FOUND IN MYSTERY OF GREENLEAF LUGGAGE.

<p/>Only the fifth paragraph interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>):

<p/>The police discovered a few days ago that the fingerprints on the suitcases and paintings are the same as the fingerprints found in Greenleaf's apartment in Rome. Therefore, it is believed that Greenleaf left the suitcases and paintings himself...

<p/>Tom quickly opened another page:

<p/>There is the possibility that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) committed suicide. Another possibility is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) exists at present under the false name of Robert S. Fanshaw or another name. A third possibility is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was murdered after leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bags in Venice.

<p/>Anyway, it is useless to search for <div class="bookquote">``Richard Greenleaf''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>any longer, because, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is alive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) does not have his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Richard Greenleaf''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>passport...

<p/>Tom couldn't believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) good luck. It meant he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wasn't suspected at all. It meant that the fingerprints really had guaranteed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) innocence. It meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not going to jail, and not going to die, but also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wasn't suspected at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was free. Except for Dickie's will.

<p/>Tom boarded the bus for Athens. The will could ruin it all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked out the window but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't notice anything. Maybe the Greek police were waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) at the American Express office. Maybe the four men he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had seen hadn't been police but some kind of soldiers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got off the bus and jumped in a taxi to go to the American Express.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sat up when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw the American Express sign, and looked around the building for policemen. Maybe the police were inside. Tom looked in. Nothing unusual.

<p/>There was a letter waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) from Mr. Greenleaf. He (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) opened it.



<p/>June 9

<p/>Dear Tom,

<p/>Received your letter yesterday.

<p/>It was not so much of a surprise to my wife and me as you may think. We both realized that Richard was very fond of you, in spite of the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) never actually told us this in any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) letters. As you said, the will does suggest that Richard has taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) own life.

<p/>My wife agrees with me that we should follow Richard's wishes. So you have, as far as the will is concerned, my personal support. I have given the copy you sent to my lawyers, who will keep you informed about their progress in putting Richard's money and other properties in your name.

<p/>Once more, thank you for your assistance when I was overseas. Let us hear from you.

<p/>With best wishes,

<p/>Herbert Greenleaf



<p/>Was it a joke? But the paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenleaf</b></font>) hand felt real. Besides, Mr. Greenleaf wouldn't joke like this, not in a million years. Tom walked to the waiting taxi. It was no joke. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)! Dickie's money and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) freedom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could have a house in Europe, and a house in America too, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) chose.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) grew suddenly worried, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dreams disappeared. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) going to see policemen waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) on every dock that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ever approached? In Alexandria? In Istanbul? Bombay? Rio? No use thinking about that. No use ruining his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) trip thinking about imaginary policemen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where to? Where to?''  (<font color='red'><b>the taxi driver</b></font>)</div>the taxi driver was asking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To a hotel, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Ripley/Ripley</b></font>)</div>Tom said with a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``The best hotel. The best, the best!''
